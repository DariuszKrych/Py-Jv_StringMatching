"I got this game to play D&amp;D with friends. What i found out was that you can play just about any game that can be played on a table, from The Game of Life to HeroQuest, just about anything you can think of. In addition, there are always pick up games and people on every day from all over the world. In short, this game has endless replay value. I can see myself playing on this more than any game I own."
Imagine a world where you can play Magic: The Gathering without having to buy a single card. Welcome to that world.
"I created a board game for my wife on our one year anniversary. While I was developing the artwork for the game, I created a digital version of the game via Tabletop Simulator. I bought a 4 pack the last time it was on sale and gifted the others to friends to help me playtest it. I was able to playtest it with a private group of friends as I was designing the finished artwork, getting the cards printed, etc.  Because of Tabletop Simulator, I was able to gift my wife a playtested, decently crafted board game, and it ended up being a lot of fun to play, all in two weeks time. Thank you to my friends who tested this with me, and thank you to Tabletop Simulator for helping me make this happen."
"Things to do after buying this game  1. Get friends 2. Download  Teamspeak  Discord 3. Play any board, card, RPG game possible 4. Hope you have enough strength to flip the table 5. Watch 'I Love Lucy' in the background     Now if only I get through Step 1...  Update 06/25/16 - I had friends, lost them. I still have all seasons of I Love Lucy on DVD. It's fine."
"Girlfriend said, 'This game is stupid buy a chess board. 'Oh so you'll play chess with me.' 'No. It's too complicated.' My real life friends don't like games so where else will I find someone to play Yahtzee on a midnight. This is the game that has propelled me to save up for a beefier computer. Sometimes I compulsively buy games that don't quite meet my comp's requirements. Bad habit, I know. With 2 GB of ram out of the required 4, I can still play quite a few games on tabletop right now--ones that come with the product and quite a few on the workshop. Unfortunately, I can't play Cards Against Humanity or Apples to Apples yet, but at least I have my Sorry and Clue.  I haven't experienced a true troll yet, only encountered one person yelling in a room. The community, for the most part, seems really friendly. My opponent had to leave, but when I asked if there was a reset button to put all the chess peices back together, he didn't know but ended up staying to put the board back together manually.  I give this game a 100 out of 10.  Update--since I reviewed this I have a bought a new computer, and now I can play all the mods. I have learned so many new games on here that I have bought or am looking forward to buy. Games I never would of heard of or played until I tried them out on this simulator such as Dead of Winter, Duke, Love Letter and the list goes on and on. Most likely the best game I ever bought and most replayable game too and well worth the value. Also my girlfriend no longer thinks this game is stupid, and now wants to buy another computer so we can play Tabletop together. So here's hoping the community keeps growing!"

"i don't have to leave my house to play board games with my friends anymore. i don't have to see their stupid, stupid faces. i'm sold."
This game is amazing. I'm writing this review from a tablet that can be spawned IN GAME. Incredible.
"it's cheaper than buying a table, and it's like you have a box under that table with infinite games inside it"
"This game has better community than any other games in Steam I have played.  If you're unfamiliar with some game (either board game or card game) people wants to teach you how to play them instead of saying: 'Lol, you're noob. You don't even know how to play this one.' or 'You don't know the rules? Then get out of here, not going to teach you how to play this game in any kind of way.' This game is one of the best I have played with great community and would recommend it to anyone who I know, including you.  I would give 10/10 so far."
"A simple but innovative concept that delivers thanks to dedicated and continued effort and improvement, Tabletop Simulator is the first mainstream product to explore an unique class of customizable simulation in the field of board games. From a basic setup with a floating table and a background, it provides a physics engine capable of simulating intermediate to advanced tabletop dynamics - from solitaire card games to complex RPGs with hundreds of elements. With a lobby system, up to eight players can play virtually any board game imaginable (unless it involves needlessly complex physics or requires unsurmountable space) in multiplayer across the internet.   Gameplay"

" WARNING:  If you are thinking of buying this make sure you understand THIS IS NOT A GAME, it is a tool for playing board games. I have seen some people in discussions who are frustrated because they didn't know what they were buying.   So What Is It?:  TTS is a platform for playing board games. There are no AI or rules coded into the game, just like a real table and board game you can pick up your playing pieces and do whatever you want with them. If you pick up your chess pawn and move it all the way across the board in one move, or try to balance it on top of another piece, or throw it off the table, the game won't care (the other player might).    The Games:  It comes included with some classic games such as chess, checkers, backgammon, jigsaw (add your own picture, pick no. of pieces etc) but the main meat of the game is the workshop. It's reasonably easy to add your own custom cards or dice, tokens and boards, and if you can do 3d modelling you can make more complicated things too.   The result is that there are thousands of mods on the workshop to download, some of them are there with the blessing of or created by the creator of the board game version (there are also a handful of paid DLC games), a few may be prototypes being tested by games designers before they consider making physical versions or homebrewed games created just for TTS, some are not everything you need for a game but may be additional pieces to use in another board game or for use in RPGs (like D&amp;D). The vast majority though are versions of physical boardgames, and these are something of a grey area, legally, as the copyright holders have generally not given permission for them to be uploaded. Some may not know about TTS or may find it easier to turn a blind eye, a few have allowed their products in the hopes that the mods may drive sales of the physical games, and some, like Munchkin, seem to be regularly taken down only to be uploaded again by someone else.   Opponents:  There are a number of gameplay options, single player is used for solitaire games, setting up tables before taking the save multiplayer or uploading as a workshop mod. Or just loading up a multiplayer game and loading all the pieces yourself if you want,whatever floats your boat. Multiplayer has options to host a server, browse current servers, direct connection or hotseat (its better to use the proper hotseat mode than single player for hot seat games as you can then each have your own hands of cards, turn counter etc). There is also a global IRC channel which is (optionally) shown in game as well as text and voice communication. Generally public games are pretty good, there are a few trolls but the mods are good at banning them from global and the host of a game can kick them from games easily if needed. You can of course password protect your game so only those you want to join can. How easy it is to find a public game of what you want to play really depends on what game it is. There seem to always be games of secret hitler for example but if you want a game of Heroquest you might have to offer to teach people in the global channel or arrange a meet up through forums or steam friends.   Overall : I really recommend TTS as long as you realise what you are buying is a an extremely flexible sandbox playing environment not a traditional computer game."
I'm currently posting this review using the tablet simulator in this game. Sadly it doesn't let me play this game on the virtual tablet so 9/10. not in depth enough.

Garry's Mod for Board Games.
What am I doing with my life......
"This is easily the most recommendable game in my library at the moment. Obviously if you aren't interested in tabletop games or are of the 'I rather play with real life friend's' crowd it may not be for you, but otherwise there is no reason not to be eyeballing this game.  As a simulator it's quite robust. I've found a few small issues here and there but these are minor and don't really make themselves felt until you've played for a considerable amount of time (50+ hours). So far though there hasn't been a game I've tried to play in Tabletop Simulator that I was unable to play due to limitations of the simulator, and although there are a few games I can think of that would be harder to play in this simulator, the vast majority of games play just fine.  That being said, the workshop content of this game is what makes it so recommendable. The basic package comes with classic games like Chess and Checkers, but if you delve into the workshop you'll find tons of great games available at the click of a button. Some copyrighted favorites are regularly taken down due to DMCA strikes, but plenty are not (and plenty of Kickstarter backed games allow their games to be uploaded). Take a gander over to the workshop page for this game and search/browse before buying it, I'm sure you'll find more than a few games you like there.  Lastly, this game is great with friends, whether they are friends you know in real life or oversea buddies. Grab a mic and a few friends and start working through that workshop content, if you're able to do this I guarantee you'll be happy with your purchase. If that's not possible, I've made my way into a few public games and have had a pretty okay experience there. Many pubs tend to have mics and usually one person is willing to explain to everyone the rules of the current game. I've had my occasional issue with the griefer who comes in and messes with everything but for the most part it's been pretty good. Plenty of tabletop games have solitaire modes as well, so even if playing with friends isn't an option all the time, you can always try your hand with solo play.  I started playing Tabletop Simulator and I almost never played tabletop games, now a half year later since buying it I have 250 non-idle hours into this game and I've tried close to 50 different games out and have had a blast playing them all. It's even helped me find a few games that I'd definitely like to buy in person for when I do get the chance to play with real life friends. Get this game. It's worth it."

"The first server i jumped into, one person automatically spawned a tablet and opened porn.  69/10"
"9/10. Buy it if board/card games interest you.  It's almost hard to believe that this game is legal, what with the fact that you can get almost any board/card game you can imagine for free on the Steam Workshop. I live in Korea and my family is in the United States. Playing board games with my mom just like when I was back home adds a sense of togetherness that we normally can't have. Sometimes I miss my home, but this game helps me cope with it. Why not 10/10? It lacks a bit of polish and is probably not quite as optimized as it could be. Still, great game. Pick it up."

Boardgame Piracy Simulator  Thanks Steam Workshop
 Early Access Review
This basically is exactly what the name implies... it provides a virtual area where you can play all types of board games on a flat surface. With nigh-infinite replayability due to anyone being able to port any game in existence or in the realms of imagination-land into the simulator this is somewhat of a good value if you like playing table games with friends*.   *  Friends not included.  
"As is, it is well worth the asking price if you have friends willing to join with you. If you are someone that loves the generic chess, checkers, backgammon, chinese checkers, etc. or if you absolutely love card games such as poker, solitare, or even go fish, this title delivers impressively. It is NOT a single player game, but you could (as mentioned) play solitare with the cards given to you.   The game doesn't hold your hand. It gives you some luxory controls, but it otherwise wont tell you what you can and cannot do. As the video preview shows off, this garuntees chaos if you allow it to happen. This is more of a good thing (I think) than a bad thing, but it does cause somewhat frustrating experiences in the online play. Because it doesn't hold your hand, people might unintentially break the rules in various games or make some up of their own. This is a good thing for people in various cultures with different rules, not to mention those that want to play house rules (such as not having to jump in checkers, something you technically don't have to do if you are okay removing the piece, but programs force you to typically anyways). This is bad because complete anarchy is expected, it really is a simulator and, like real life, some disagreements are expected. Overall, I'd say it's a good thing despite the consequences; I believe you could say it's a double edge sword.  In my opinion, this game's strongest advantage over anything else on Steam that demands much more money for such less content, such as any mediocre chess game on Steam, is the freedom this game gives you. Not just the ability to do virtually anything within reason like the first paragraph poked at a bit, but the ability to create custom games and downloading other's custom games. This, of course, inevitably means about 90% of the time COPYRIGHTED content. This is a huge blow over the board game and card game industry and I ♥♥♥♥ing love it.   Just like the whole 'people don't want to buy music on the internet' and then the same morons began wondering why music piracy began to rise, you can expect this tabletop simulator to have a significant role for a similar outcome in regards to board games and card games. We asked for a good *insert trading card game* simulator and we got ignored, maybe humored with half ♥♥♥♥♥ games instead, but now we have an alternative. Some copyright claims have been made, particularly Munchkin, this was to be expected but some are yet the wiser and either ignore this game or don't even realize it exists like (it seems) a good part of the gaming community... particularly the people willing to pay $50 for a chess simulator.   Regardless, I wont ramble on about that nonsense that doesn't matter to us, the consumers (at least not until our 'freedoms' start get taken away by lawyers that are smarter, yat greedier, than their own good). No, I will discuss further how custom work *kinda* works, as someone who puts in a heavy load of *cough*copyrighted material*cough*. It is very easy! For cards, you just make a huge picture and put all the cards on it, up to 69 specifically at the moment, and the game cuts it up into pieces. The downside? The quality will be ♥♥♥♥ unless it is a very big picture. To make matters worse, the game currently requires you to upload said giant image to a random website for everyone to download it from. This is bad, because there isn't exactly a variety of file hosts to use that would allow such a huge file. I currently use dropbox, but it gave me problems recently that I will forgive because I have nobody else to go through, but I will never forget. With that said, it would be nice if Tabletop Simulator uses an alernative last resort file sharing method, have it between the players.  Why wouldn't the game do this from the start? Well, there is the possibility of saving file types with specific names and the game will, for now on, load that specific file instead of the original. If you had it so the game will send the files the players have, this could result in exploits that involve offensive or otherwise illegal materials most of us don't want to see. So, I agree not to have this as a primary form of getting files, but it would be nice to be able to download from the host or whoever upload the item and maybe keep track of the steam id that gave that specific file to you, that way reporting is an option. Hopefully the TTS devs will consider this as a solution to the problem, assuming this problem was the reason they avoided the option of peer to peer file transfer.   The game offers so much, but like any early access games, bugs are expected. They fixed quite a few recently, but some still exist. Despite all of them, the game is well worth it. However, I cannot stress it enough that you plan to do this with friends, for randoms only play a handful of games.  tl;dr:  Pros: Freedom. For something that is just on a single table, it feels as big as a sanbox (I'm exaggerating, but for what's worth, you have building blocks, something you'd see sometimes in a real life sandbox) Variety. You get a lot for what you paid for. Try to look up chess games on Steam.  Customization. You can make your own games or copy and paste something else... probably copyrighted most likely. Because of this, you can play virtually anything you dreamed of having in your childhood for the price that is TTS. Online. You can play board games with loved ones from far away, or with near by friends that don't want to spend hundreds on trading cards or RPG materials. There is some anti griefing options in place, but maybe we could use more.  Cons: There isn't a whole lot of people in the community, a lot of them are griefers.  Players currently cannot just pull card decks out of workshop items without loading it, something that is addressed for other items.  Lack of file transfering between players with custom items. Of course, this is probably to prevent porn to be traded around rather than monopoly board images by 'mistake,' but this is something the devs should look into.   Overall, this game is splended. We have building blocks, but could someone for the love of god add in some plastic army men?   This isn't the kinda game you wait for a sale for, this is the kinda game you buy with only one regret: not buying it sooner.  9/10 seems fair, but it will be different for everyone. I ♥♥♥♥ing love Monopoly, Yugioh, Coupe, Tsuro, Chess, Poker, etc. so I make the most of this game. For those that are not so into all of that, maybe you wont make the most of it like I do. Regardless, buy it. Seriously... buy it.   Edit: Players, including non hosts, can now upload their trading card decks. Initially, only hosts were able to lost from saved chest items but that is no longer the case. Because of this update, I removed this from the cons list.  It has come to my attention that someone made software on the forums that indeeds allows hosts to send card deck files to others from their own computer. Clearly the game is capable, but I do not personally know the details behind this. I just wish to point it out that it's possible, but I still will leave it under cons due to it being unoffical software and the game doesn't seem to even hint the possibility as well, again, I don't know the details in how it works.  It is worth noting that there is now a tutorial added to the game. It, however, does not teach you absolutely everything players may want to know in the game. Things I recall not being taught includes locking and unlocking items, the L key, changing object sizes with the -/+ keys, or how to navigate the menus which might be a confusing part of the game to newer players. I mention this in regards to my initial comment that this game doesn't hold your hand. Still doesn't, but better.  Hosts can now customize server settings fluently, so removed from cons."
"Great pickup, sale or not. Includes classic games not only pre-loaded, but also from the Steam Workshop.  Settlers of Catan, Monopoly, Battleship, and UNO are great pickups from the Workshop.  Also, table flipping."
Start up a game of Uno or Monopoly  Spend the next six hours showing your friends dumb videos on the tablet instead  Just like real life!

I love board games. My best friend in on another continent. We can now play board games together.  This has become my most played game now. It should win the Steam awards in all the categories. There's never been a more copious source of entertainment in my life.
"They included fully-functioning tablets in a recent update.  Now you can look up furry p0rn while cheating at Uno, just like in real life."
"Entered a server expecting to play Eels and Escalators, ended up being held at gunpoint while playing Chinese Checkers and listening to the USSR National Anthem. Shrek was also standing, watching, in the corner.   10/10 would be held at gunpoint for our Soviet motherland again."
"Tabletop Simulator is exactly what it sounds like. Through the power of Steam Workshop as well as a lot of well-done built-in assets, you can essentially make any tabletop experience you so desire. Want to make your own card game? Go for it! Want to create your own intricate RPG of some description? You can do that with animated monster figurines! The possibilities are literally infinite.  The hosting capabilities of TTS are also really well done. You can kick and/or ban people from your server easily, and you can restrict certain things from being possible within your server. Anyone you've banned is sent to a personal blacklist for any servers you host in the future. If you host anything related to the Steam Workshop, anyone who joins will automatically download the necessary files without having to be subscribed to that particular mod at all. It's one of the most robust systems I've seen.  Even the game's DLC, thankfully, follows that last rule. Originally, Tabletop Simulator had a weird hybrid system of everyone owning DLC or just the host or whatever. It was convoluted, and it's been changed to a much simpler system that works like the Steam Workshop. Only the host needs to own the DLC. It makes everything so easy!  The only gripe I have is that mod files do take a long time to load, but obviously this depends on the size of the mod and where the images are being hosted. It's really apparent on larger mods, though. But every release has seen improvements to the game's performance, and mod loading has gotten smoother and smoother, so this isn't as much of an issue as when I first wrote this review.  Prior to originally writing this, for the record, I had spent two hours in a heated Uno game with 7 random people I had never met before, and all of us were having immense fun. Never in my entire life had I thought that would be possible.  If you like playing tabletop games of any kind, you owe it to yourself to purchase this and get your friends in as well. It's a hell of a fun time."

"  dont let the name fool you. despite the ongoing trend of intentionally faulty 'simulation' games, this one is true to its name.  when you buy this game, you own one of the most substantial simulators on the steam store. if you enjoy casual board games, or simply want to goof around without leaving behind an actual mess, this is the game to get.  one of the most shining features of this game has to be the workshop. this game, by default, comes with most of your standard non-copyrighted games. however, with the help of the steam workshop, you can easily fill up your library with all of your favorite childhood games. from magic: the gathering to chutes and ladders, tabletop simulator has it all.  my advice is to play the game with friends, or people you trust. consider yourself warned that your 2 hour monopoly game can easily go airborne by the simple click of a button. oftentimes, the 'table flip' feature can mark a fun way to conclude a fair game of chess. it can also easily be abused by a more deceitful individual. luckily, you can edit the settings of the current server to make it essentially grief-proof, provided you are the owner of the current server.  all in all, this game provides endless hours of entertainment. whether your intention is to construct a sandbox of your favorite game characters and send them clattering into a dark abyss, or play a jigsaw game with the face of your pet cat, you cant go wrong with tabletop simulator."

"I played UNO with strangers, and then more strangers joined and changed it to a furry porn game."
"Update 2/10/16: OHHHHH MAN. With TTS' recent update mods loads much, much faster. With the game being even more optomized now I couldn't suggest the game any harder.   Do you like board games? I like board games and I own this. If you like board games you should also own this."
A lot cheaper than flying to play a tabletop game with a friend in another country.
"I highly recommend this game due to 3 main things.  1. Great simulator, embracing all things that should be played on a table. Having Steam Workshop incorporated in this game, gives everyone a chance to make anything they imagine into a table top game.  2. Fantastic multiplayer, allowing up to 8 players to enjoy some fun games, from anywhere in the world! 3. Lots of support from the Dev Team, who is always updating the game or informing us of new things to come. They are a stand out amongst many game companies out there. Hopefully they keep it up! So if you enjoy a virtual world, where any game can be your destiny, then grab this and have a great time! Cheers! Frost's Rating: 5 out of 5 Beers"
"VR review.  AMAZING. I had purchased TTS some time ago on a holiday sale for me and a friend. One particular game became rather laborious to play on a 2D screen as it involved moving miniatures around a board. But today I noticed TTS sitting in my VR list and I didn't recall that being there yesterday. So, I checked the news and had to see...I now love it. Card games, table top games, all in full 3D. Now I can walk around the table and move my pieces so easily, so naturally.   Sadly, I am not buying my friend a VIVE."

"First of all: don't get fooled by the pictures and videos on the store page!  Play board games and card games (not chess or domino as suggested by said videos) with your friends as much as you want and whichever game you want (nearly everything you can wish for, check the workshop!). There is no excuse such as distance anymore. Clear advantage of TTS over real-life board games: You don't have to tidy up the table after you've finished a game. Just reset and start all over again or load the next game.  Played more than 70 hours already until now and (hopefully) more to follow.  EDIT: Definitely my all-time favorite game in Steam. You HAVE to get this, if you like boardgames (and i assume you do, because you read this)."

"This game is suprising. A simulator game that isnt a drunk buy that you play once like goat simula I MEAN EVERY SIMULATOR. I was playing chess with my friend in this game and it was better than actually doing stuff in real life because i dont have to move like the fat (butt) i am I was dominating the game and then suddenly something happened He defriended me on steam, flipped the table, and left the game in 5 seconds 10/10 would get table-rekt again"
"Do you like tabletop wargaming but haven't won the lottery? Buy this  Do you like the prospect of playing a D&amp;D game in 3D? Buy this  Do you like a ton of free content from the workshop? Buy this  Friends moved away or just have a lot of online friends? Yeah, buy it."

That in no way effects this game/tool ability to do everything it promises in an intuitive and very satisfying way. The learning curve is minimal and there are literally thousands of games you can play.

"God this is amazing. Even if the app started sort of like a joke it has and still is steadily evolving into a serious platform for all your boardgame needs. There's still some clumsy things like handling multiple objects at a time, you will definitely need to skim the documentation to learn some control stuff (doubly so if you want to get into the really advanced things) but with a solid foundation and the hard work of hundreds of modders there is no better way to have an incredible collection of boardgames right there in one place.  True, at the moment each mod is incredibly vulnerable to being abandoned and lose assets as their web hosting fails but with any luck you will still find (or be able to make, even) versions of whatever game you might want to play. There's very little automation so rule keeping still falls square onto the player's hands in the vast majority of cases, for better or worse. Legality of each mod is a complicated thing, the community is not enormous so it can be a bit complicated finding new players for the more obscure games... but still, even with all the blemishes and all the fact is that there's nothing quite like Tabletop Sim out there.  At least not yet."
"This is by far the best Board Game / Card Game simulator by far and I highly recommend  if you love Board Games or Card Games   I know I don't have many hours on this Game but I've been here from the start.  There's no rules to this Game, just play however you want to play. Invite a friend to play Chess or a couple of friends for a night of poker or solve some jigsaw puzzle from an random image you found online. FLIP the table if you lost a game or you're mad. Play a game underwater (HDRI Panorama Images you can use). Draw all over the table or just whatever you like.  There's tools you can use ingame that are useful like:   Tablet:"

"This is one of the absolute best purchases I've ever made on Steam - its basically an infinite collection of board games. See a game you haven't played in forever? Play it. Want to know if that boardgame you want to buy is any good? Try it. Have an urge to have a lazy conversation with your gf/wife but want to do something while you talk? Load up a random game and try it out. Feeling down? Join a server and proceed to have shenangins with people.   The only criticism I have for this game isn't even because of the game itself (the developers are fantastic and are (as I type this) updating the features of the simulator. Its the community. Some people enter lobbies and ruin games. Not with all that much frequency, mind you, but enough so that most people now lock their servers. A handful of open (and legitimate) servers are still around, but its like 5% - 10% of the servers listed. So if your planning on playing without a real life friend or two..... I'd still say get the game (seriously its fantastic), but don't expect to play anything but popular card games.   UPDATE AS OF 6/24/16 --  Game is in excellent shape, workshop is alive and kicking, and the content in the game is very nicely set. Honestly, its a complete masterpiece as a game.  On a different note, I'd like to take a minute to talk about the community. Tabletop has probably one of the best communities for what it is: the game attracts essentially only people who enjoy board games. So your playing a game about playing any board game you desire, with a bunch of people who love board games. Its great, like 80% of the time. 20% of the time you'll be stuck waiting (for people to join games), or playing games your not super into, or getting trolls (who are easy to ban). The server issue still exists, about 80% to 90% of servers are locked and at any give time your looking at 15 to around 30ish open lobbies.   I personally think those are decently acceptable statistics. And tabletop is a great place to make friends - I've added at least 30 people in the last 3 months alone from this game. These are people I spent a MINIMUM of 2 hours laughing, chatting and playing with over a game of Risk, Battlestar, Monopoly, or any of over 200 games I've personally subscribed to. The game is honestly a great way to get out there and hang out with people you'd otherwise never meet.   TL;DR -  A Steam Must-buy, especially if you have real life friends who also have the game. 10/10 Monopoly Boards."
"EDIT: I still recommend this game, but nice players are far and few between. I'm mute IRL and I can't speak because of that, so it's pretty saddening to have people use voice chat to confused others about what actions I did and then laughing when you ask them to stop. :/ Pretty much every game with an element of deception (which is nearly every tabletop game ever) is unplayable for me because of this. The only upside is nearly no game has rules for if someone wants to quit playing in the middle of the game, so when people do that to me, I just leave and ♥♥♥♥ it up for everyone.   So, I think the only way to describe this game is to explain what happened in my first three hours.  Bought the game, started it up, played through the tutorial. I then went to tools and started playing with that, to learn how the tools work. One is literally a shared web browser. If you don't realize how powerful that is, then you've got problems.  After learning a bit of the tools and such, I then went through the browser to find a server to watch. I found two people playing risk, so I started watching them. Turns out, their risk board was bugging out, so they changed the game to catan.  Only problem is, one of them didn't know how to play catan.  We taught them how to play through the entire game, and we had zero issues with fustration or anything of the sort.  Confusion over whose turn it was on the other hand.. Yeah. That's when the host spawned in a miniature and said 'Pass this when your turn is over.'  In real life, Catan is the kind of game where turns could never end. You can sit there for hours braindead trying to figure out all the possibilities, at least, wheny ou're new to the game.   We started doing our turns in sequence much faster, and we were collecting resources. I was about to trade in 4 of a kind for one resource, as you do when you play with people who don't understand the concept of economics at all. People I know in real life.   That's when they traded resources. 1 to 1.   I have never traded resources 1 to 1 in a game of catan. The people I play with IRL always give you an option. Either you let them win, or you play a painfully hellish game in hopes of getting the resource you need.  And so, we continued to trade resources 1 to 1 back and forth and build.   For the first time, I actually played a game of catan in which the building phase wasn't dragged out over the course of the entire game.  We kept the table clean through the item bags and the entire game went easily.  Finally, someone reached 10 points, which signals the end of the game in Catan. The person who won was the one who didn't know how to play at the start.   And during all of this, the giant button that says 'FLIP TABLE' taunted us all. And none of us clicked it, despite the fustrations a game of catan can cause.   100/100, would play with anonymous people who are nicer than my RL friends again."
It is quite simply the Garry's Mod of board games and cards.
Great sim to sit around with friends and chill after a night of competitive gaming. Grab a beer and play.

Its great if you cant meet up with your freinds at 2 o'clock in the morning to play a game of uno, or cards agianst humanity. The online is also nice to, on guy even spent an hour and a half teaching me how to play magic the gathering just so we could play a few games. and plus you can flip the table when you get mad or lose a game. (I typed this whole review on the tablet in the game :) )"
Tabletop Simulator with its workshop offers thousands and thousands of  board games  that you can play with your friends online. Its absolutely amazing game where you make your own rules and conditions only with minor restrictions and issues. I won this simulator and it is like winning a lottery - just with this one piece you can play countless others!    9/10

"Bias: I am a dinosaur. My arms are normally too short to reach a real table for board games. This makes it easier.  In my opinion, one of my favorite games on steam. The ability to play most board games with little clean up and expense make this simulator great. Thanks to friends. I have learned new board games, that I have seen in game shops that looked interesting, but did not want to spend $40+ on and find out that its not fun, too difficult to play, or no real life friends who wanted to play. This simulator has led me to purchase physical copies of games like Catan, Munchkins, Love Letter, Forbidden Island and a few others. And also has allowed me to introduce friends to these game in real life, who have also found them enjoyable.   I would give this game 10/10. It is a game I will continue to play and use to learn new games. Also if you have this, and have not tried Secret Hitler. You should. :D"

"Welcome to Sniver's super reviews  This game is great because you have the ability to unleash your inner imagination, and act onto events with your utmost potential.   Lost the game?  Flip the table.  Dropped something off the table?  Flip the table.  Someone is messing with your side of the table?  Flip the table.  Think the game is rigged?  Flip the table.  See someone cheating?  Flip the table.  Someone keeps spawning random things?  Flip the table.  Everyone is ignoring you?  Flip the table.  Someone is supersizing your dog plush?  Flip the table.  Someone targetting you in UNO?  Flip the table.  Keep getting unlucky rolls?  Flip the table.  Getting real sick of everyone's ♥♥♥♥?  Flip the table.  Don't know where you are?  Flip the table.  On your period?  Flip the table.  Got daddy issues?  Flip the table.  Crippling depression?  Flip the table.  Panicking about the futile existence of mankind and the eternal void that burns within all, consuming their flesh from the inside out in a way that permits a concept of thought, in which in truth, is the painstaking belief, a lie, that hides the fact that man is corrupt and evil, and none should exist in a plane with so much potential, yet unlit flames?  Flip the table.  Someone stole your die?  Flip the table.  10/10, would flip the table again if I wasn't banned from all of my friends' games.     Apparently I have anger issues."

"It's $20 for a mostly-endless board game library, as the Workshop content is incredible to say in the least. What's not to love?  Edit: This review seems to be gaining traction, and seeing as this title just went on sale, I'll add a bit more depth. Basically, this game can become any board game you want it to be, which is what makes the game so incredible. The Workshop content for this game has almost any game you could think of, even if it's in a very simple form (maybe not coded to 'autopilot' game setup and such, but still manageable as if you were using your own hands to play it). And given that installing workshop content is as simple as a button press, it makes loading up a board game for friends super easy and quick. I even use this to try out new board games I'm thinking of buying as physical copies, as usually someone has made a Workshop mod for it, and I can dig up a rulebook somewhere to see if friends or I would enjoy the game. So overall, pick this game up no matter the price. At $20 it's an incredible deal, and at anything less than that it's almost stealing."
"The game was awsome before it had VR support. But after playing in VR, this game was always meant for it. Currently it only has Vive support.  Previously I just used it to check out Warhammer models. Now I want to find games. The table feels like I'm at a game hall, you interact more natural. The controls feel good, need a few more options on the wand and the laser could work better like it does in the SteamVR menus.  Great game, definitely a must buy if you a fan of tabletop gaming, but the smell of body odor and Chinese food wear on you, this is a must buy."
"Quite possibly the best simulator game out there. At least in my opinion.  Does what it says on the tin, Tabletop simulator lets you enjoy tabletop games either on your own or with friends. This is fantastic for anyone, like me, who has no local friends, but still has the urge to play things like Monopoly or Connect 4.  Keeping in mind that almost anything that is a licensed game is not in the main title. You can still find basic card decks, D&amp;D style figures and almost any kind of dice you could ask for, among many other things. The amount of detail given to the controls and options is astounding as well. Basic physics on items, but it certainly does the job!  However, the meat comes with the workshop. What the developers cannot do legally, the community can do, and for free! This is certainly the greatest part of Tabletop. Not only the licensed games that are available, but people being given the ability to be creative and make their own games or rules, if they so choose!  Quite honestly worth the price if you and/or some friends are really interested in playing board/card/D&amp;D-style games, but distance or ability to get together in one spot proves to be an issue."

"Fantastic game. I'm a busy engineer, with most of my friends living far away. Nothing better than a board game to chat over, and this game is the closest thing to a board game night I can think of. I'm not much for the current batch of pvp multiplayer games; it's not worth the time to get proficient enough that each match isn't a lesson in competitive respawning, but this type of online multiplayer is absolutely wonderful. I'm very excited to have found this game, as it will no doubt be a solid way to keep up with my friends.  The sandbox element is wonderful as well. I can definitely see my self contributing to the workshop as time goes on. The game makes it extremely accessible to be a contributor to the community, and from what I can tell, it's a great community worth contributing to.  Absolutely a 10/10"

"This is one of those games (or perhaps application is the right term) that I wanted to get for a long time. I bought it during the summer sale at 50% off and feel like it was a good value, but know it is almost useless in single player, unless you want a strange option for playing solitaire. It's all about the multiplayer, either online, or in hotseat mode which would be couch multiplayer. I have played a few pure online games, but prefer to play couch MP. The workshop is amazing, thanks to all the steamers that have made amazing content for this game and all the great games that inspired them."
The controls and UI are kind of awkward at first but once you've got to grips with them this is a brilliant simulator. Definitely a must have if you enjoy Tabletop games due to the vast selection of games already available in the workshop.
"Bought this game thinking that it'd be some fun to play boardgames with my friends online. Boy was I right, but does this game offer so much more. Not only can you take all your opponents peices and chuck them off the table, you can draw wings and wangs all you want. And if that's a bit too elementary for you the tablet offers plenty of that if you're brave enough to surf the web on it with strangers.   All in all, whether you actually want to plays games or just mess around with a sandbox physic engine with some interesting quirks (hundreds of giant zero gravity dice anyone?) and anywhere inbetween this game fulfills it and does it really well."

Im writing this game's review from ingame tablet.cool 10/10 would again
"What can I say about this that has NOT already been stated? This is my favorite title on steam.  Why? Lets start with the fact that nearly all my board games that I own are available on here. The ability to play them or to test out different strategies in a quick manner is something that has caused my gaming group to play more together. I am also able to save my games no matter where I am at. So if me and my friends want to play a game that we know we cannot get through, but would love to be able to continue it later, well.... WE NOW HAVE A WAY TO DO THIS! Gone are the 'Take a picture of the board, write down what we had here....'  While nothing can ever replace the physical game, and the enjoyment that a game night with a bunch of local friends, it does provide a great way to play with my friends that have moved away, as well as introduce different people to the joy that board games.  Tabletop Simulator has given me a way to expand my physical board game collection, introduce people to games, play with friends from a far, and test out strategies, all for $20. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys board games, or perhaps are interested in getting started, and want to learn just how different and enjoyable board games can be from video games. 10/10"
"To clarify, this is an engine to play board games. You can play almost any game you can think of. There have been weekly or at least monthly updates, and they keep adding more features the community requests. I had one issue with the workshop not syncing, and the devs actually worked with Valve to get the issue resolved quickly.  The only problem for new players, is finding games to join. You need to look for groups that host TTS games. An easy one is Tabletop Simulator Club (look for that group in Steam Groups).  Once you play a few games you will realize how great this engine/sandbox is, and if you find a few people to play online with, you will have hours of entertainment.  Last comment, I had to chance to meet the developers at PAX Prime, and they both seemed extremely nice. Can't wait to see where they take TTS next, or their next project."

Since I have several friends on Skype, we heard about TTS, and all got happy about it.  It can be tricky sometimes to find the games from the workshop to play, and sometimes every workshop game does not work as expected, but overall I'm happy with TTS!"
"It really is exactly as advertised. Perhaps the most ingenius tabletop sim ever designed. Don't be fooled by its simplicity. It's not all card games and chess... you can load up full WH40k armies, and the most obscure board games you can think of with fully detailed and interactable parts and pieces you can literally pick up and throw across the board.  This game takes the concept of software like VASSAL and steps it up 1000%.  If you like tabletop games. Get this. Don't even hesitate."

"One of the best investments I've ever made in video games and in gaming as a whole.  If you like boardgames, this simulation program is for you. The Steam Community itself has made this game/program worth over 100 times more than it's retail value. Look through the Steam Workshop and see all the premium and popluar games to use for free in Tabletop Simulator. The Steam Community has donated its time, thoughts, and ideas in bringing to us, to each other, the best boardgames and tabletop games in this virtual experience. With this we can virtually own and playtest these games.   THANK YOU to Tabletop Simulator and the Steam Community for helping me and my friends save thousands of dollars in boardgames.   If you really like a game in the Tabletop Simulator Steam Workshop, please support the actual developers of the game itself by buying an actual physical copy for yourself... or 1 copy for your gaming group... to show your love for that game. We have personally bought games that we felt were more than worthy to physically own (Dead of Winter, Epic Spell Wars, Munchkin, Star Trek Panic, Pandemic Cthulhu, etc)."
"Great for playing basically  any  board-,card- or dice-game known to man, and more; Or even for developing and playtesting your own game ideas.  Anything from simple coinflipping (yes, there's a coin), Marbles, Yatzee, Solitaire and Poker, to Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaigns or Settlers of Catan; To games you've invented yourself, is possible to play with this.   It's basically a table and a chest of pieces, with endless possibilies to get both singleplayer or multiplayer games going on it. It's got both local 'hotseat', lan and internet multiplayer.   Lua scripting and custom boards, cards, pieces or dices should also be enough to take care of anything you'd feel is missing. Simply create it yourself, if you can't find it in-game or at the  Workshop .   (Personally, i chose to nominate this gem for 'Game Within a Game' category for Steam Awards 2016.) "

"As brilliant a value as this is for consumers, one cannot help but be curious how much of an impact this has on board and card game developers. On one hand, people are more or less playing there games without paying for them... or are they building a bigger fan base from people who would have never played much less bought some of those games before. I guess what I am asking is, what is the percieved value for the developers of these games?  Beyond that, you honestly can't find a better bargain for $20 or less if you enjoy playing games with friends...and I emphasize playing with friends."

"Tabletop Simulator is an amazingly simple, enjoyable game. Whether you meet new friends, play with old friends, or meet new friends while playing with your old friends, this game is amazing regardless! Play games you played as a child, find new games you think will be fun, play classic games, and play games you've never even heard of before, with your beloved pals.   Going outside is for normies. With Tabletop Simulator, you can experience the joy of playing with your real friends, online friends, and completely random people while in the comfort of your own home and computer. Play games such as Chess, Checkers, Pictionary, Pool, Poker, Mahjong, Chinese Checkers, Candyland, Monopoly, Sorry!, Dominoes, Jenga, Eels and Escolators, Apples to Apples, Dungeons and Dragons, Black Jack, Roulette, and games you've literally never heard of!  This game is versatile. You can play board games, play all sorts of D&amp;D games and even set up your own boards and dungeons, and learn new ways to have a blast with your friends. Be prepared to flip tables, laugh, rage, and appreciate with this game.  I purchased this game when it was on sale for $10.00. I know that $20 is a bit much for a stupid table simulator game, but it is worth it my friend. I suggest this game to anyone who has or has not friends, because you can always make great friends on this game by joining or hosting servers free to the public."

It's a game that lets you play just about any card or board game you can imagine. What's not to love?
"   This was given to me as a gift back in 2014   Something to enjoy with friends that are out of reach but want to play a board/card game with them. Table flipping is only funny when appropriate, otherwise it'll be annoying and rude. If you're going for that 1000 flips achievement, don't make it a priority along with the hour benchmarks.  This is a good way to try out your 3D modeling &amp; graphic skills for pieces, bags, cards, dice, background etc. Can even upload a custom image to the table (square or rectangle). See if you can create 3 original workshop items to share that isn't already made. :P  Do note though and be warned, if your lobby is public it must be appropriate for everyone, otherwise the devs may revoke your key if informed. Be sure to make your lobby private by putting in a password; can do whatever you want in a private lobby. (Yes, can even upload nsfw images on the table or puzzle pieces, go nuts; just make sure it's not part of a workshop item or you'll be in bigger trouble.)   $15 is worth it if you plan to play board/card games often with your friends, or make custom stuff with 3d modeling or art, otherwise I would wait for a sale for like $10.  -----  Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:  BluePaw's Underrated Games List  Join and/or follow if you wish."

"This is a physics sandbox where you can basically play any 2D tabletop game in any manner you please. No rules are hardcoded (although Lua scripting is supported for convinience!) and a large variety of tools are available to perform every action you please. They're officially licensing full commercial board games for digital conversion as their growing library of DLC, and most any other game you can think of has already been faithfully recreated in the Steam Workshop.  If you are an artist of any kind, you can effortlessly upload new content to use in any way you please. Entirely custom boards, cards, figures, dice, and other trinkets are all things you can produce for any purpose you need.  One downside, it unfortunately has a  lot  of trouble with vertical layouts, making it impossible to play Battleship with upright boards, difficult to play Connect-4 as originally intended (although if you lay it down as a slope it works much better), and very nearly impossible to play 23rd Century 3D Chess unless you're in Vive VR mode.  It also tends to have some difficulty simulating the rest of the room, beyond the table. The DLCs add entirely custom table and 3D room models, but when you flip the table, you flip the room with it."

"Awesome engine that can run nearly any tabletop game. just check the workshop for yourself! there are tons of good games that you'd prolly never know existed or be able to play due to region, price, age, or w/e. It's also a good way to test a game before buying it physically. TTS' still being constantly updated. and the community's really helpful when you don't know how to perfectly play the game. Try read the rulebook or something beforehand, tho. We all know that playing a tabletop games on the pc isn't as swift to as it is IRL, but that's the price we have pay for not having to move to other ppl's places (if it's even possible) everytime you want to play a few games... at least some of the game's functions can be automated with scripts is the modder has the patience to do it... and no one has to clean the table after flipping it :)"
"Tabletop Simulator lets you play hundreds of dollars worth of board games free of charge.

Overall: This game and the content it offers is really a gem within a gem (or perhaps a 'game within a game' eh).   [Score: 9/10]   I  would  definitely recommend this to a friend."

"Tabletop Simulator combines the potential inherent in a physics-based sandbox with a wide combination of out-of-the-box board games and easily-subscribed Steam Workshop games. The controls are fun and easy to get the hang of, and you'll need them for everything from Dungeons &amp; Dragons to Axis &amp; Allies to  five-player chess .  This is a wise investment even if you don't have many friends interested in tabletop games. Although it's generally a better experience with friends, meeting strangers and playing games with them is fun enough.  (Laser Light Show is a ♥♥♥♥♥ though.)"
"*Dude has 100+ hours in Tabletop Simulator*  Me: Hey man I see you play Tabletop alot, what games do you know? Because I'd love to play some Blood Rage later tonight if you're down. Dude: Oh me? I just play Secret Hitler, Uno, and Cards Against Humanity ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Me: ...Oh...  10/10 - my favorite Steam game is a game simulator."
"I generally don't write reviews, so I will try and keep this short and to the points. The Good: You can play lots of games in it, with your friends, pretty easily. It's fun, there's lots of user content from the steam workshop to keep you entertained as well.  The Bad: The new UI update is aweful. The UI is trash now, however it's not any real reason to not buy the game. Hopefully the Devs will undo it.  I generally just play Magic The Gathering on here, as it has a lot of good plugins from the community for that. I have not purchased the DLC as most of the DLC is also on the steam workshop because other players have made it better. So in short, this game is absolutely worth it, just really hope the devs fix the UI."
"Can play 40k in any way or size i want for 110% free. 60 dollar model tanks? Let me just copy and past a few of those to use.  I'm genuinly amazed Game's Workshop and others have not sued this game yet  Easily one of the most brilliant games to come out this decade, if you got friends the game is an amazing amount of fun."
I like to turn off the digital permissions for my friends and force them to watch hentai.  10/10

"Playing board games are big part of my childhood, playing with various people in my family. This game is amazing it's brought back some of those memories and I'm sure new ones are going to come from it from playing with other people online.  Not only can you play various games you can get new ones via the workshop. There's no static movment there's phyics based motion with give's it a sense of realism. Rolling your die and hitting a another player token never gets old.  Play with people online with up to 8 people.  Filp the table in rage!  I love it!  Buy it!!  "
10/10 great game!  Ever wanted to play Warhammer but dont wanna cough up 5 grand? Want to learn card games youve never heard of? or maybe just spend some quality time 3d modeling and make your own game!  
"Despite Tabletop Simulator being in Early Access, it's very much worth purchasing in my opinion. I can't speak too much about the default tabletop games it brings such as dominoes or chess. However, my friends and I have put in nearly 100 hours of game time already because we've found this to be a very fun, social game to play.   We've downloaded and installed at least a dozen board games and it's been really fun trying them out. We've played Cards Against Humanity, Fluxx, Ascension, King Of Tokyo, Munchkin, Red Dragon Inn (a drinking game that we've had a lot of fun playing :P ), Dixit, Betrayal at House on the Hill, Once Upon A Time, to name a few. It's been a fun experience playing all these board games that we normally wouldn't have been able to play online with friends. A few of us have even dabbled into some light Role Playing which we didn't really ever try before and found that we've enjoyed it.  The game isn't without its bugs here and there but I can honestly say it's nothing game breaking. The developers have done a fantastic job with fixing bugs and releasing frequent updates. Every time we've found ourselves asking in game 'Wouldn't it be great if they added X, Y, Z?” they seem to add those things in within the next update or two and then some. I feel that the developers listen to their community and actually take their suggestions and implement them.   Overall, I most definitely recommend this game for hours of silly fun with friends. If board games are your thing or it's something that you've never really tried but are curious about, I absolutely recommend you give Tabletop Simulator a try."

"Tabletop Simulator is not a perfect game -- it still has its moments where an additional feature or a bit more polish is needed; however, TS is undoubtedly one of the most impressive titles out there for those who are willing to put a little bit of time and effort into their games.  I use it to run a 5th edition D&amp;D game. The workshop has hundreds of mods allowing you to play anything from complex miniatures games to Uno.  It's sublimely simple yet rich at the same time. I highly recommend it if you like to do a touch of modding and/or have a group of friends you'd like to play tabletop games with."

"As of 9/26/16 I've only had the game for a day, and have less than ten hours played. But the game is incredibly fun, I've played poker, blackjack, and so many RPGs I've never played before. All without playing with a single friend yet. All strangers. The community on the game is incredibly friendly, and welcoming.  I plan to use this for my DnD games with friends, once they decide to not be cheap and buy it.."
"This is a canvas for your imagination. Everything I have set out to do in this 3D environment, I have found a way to make happen. Years and distance had put an end to my tableside gaming... but we are back. If you have the slightest inkling of creativity, get this game. With lua scripting and an endless supply of resources on the web, there really is no limit to what you can build."

Great sandbox for your gaming needs! Buy if you love tabletop games but lack the routine gaming meetup / budget to buy all the games / far from the city.

"Best place to play, learn and make board games, buy it and you wont regret it if you have a urge to play some."
"Generally speaking, this game ist not much more than a physics sandbox with some tools for administrating up to 8 players and supporting custom models. But this is enough to open up unlimited possibilities for boardgame geeks, don't let the screenshots from the store fool you! This sim can handle way more than Chess, Checkers and other common stuff you'll find online en masse.  That said, the workshop support is the heart of this application, because it allows modders to recreate every boardgame, cardgame, tabletop or physically existing game. Lots of historical stuff you'll never get your hands on (except you're willing to pay high collector's prices) like games from Avalon Hill or those nasty american nuclear-themed games from the atomic age.   Here's a random selection of well-done workshop items you should try out:  - Advanced Civilization - Bohnanza (popular german cardgame) - Carcasonne - Settlers of Catan (including Star Trek mod) - Risk (LotR-mod / Star Wars-mod and more) - Exploding Kittens - Zombie Dice - Starship Troopers (based on the novel, not on the movie) - Alien  - Fallout-Monopoly - Escape from Colditz - X-Wing Miniature Game - Warhammer  - Hotel  There are no limits: Scan your favorite game's cards, reference sheets and rules, import 3D-Models and preserve this stuff for all times. Clearly a totally unterrated game, or better to say, tool.   10/10: Why did I have to wait until 2015 to get my hands on an application like this?"

"If you have friends who like any sort of tabletop games, you will all love Tabletop Simulator. It's introduced me to a dozen different games I'd never played before that I went out and bought because they were great. Playing games with friends is easy and fun.  If you don't have people to play with though, it's a bit harder to find or start a game. It's a big time investment to explain a new game to a half dozen people who've never played before, so expect people to quit halfway through the explanation and have to start all over again with someone else. Because of that, most of the games you can join on public servers are ones that are relatively easy to explain or have a lot of people in the general player base that already know how to play. There's probably 20-30 different public servers open at any given time with [currently] popular games like Secret Hitler, Betrayal at House on the Hill, X-Wing, Codenames, Red Dragon Inn, Epic Spell Wars, Magic: TG, Bang!, etc. being the most commonly featured."
"So I've been eyeing this game for a while before I bought it and let's just say I'm so glad I got it while it was on sale. Not because it wasn't worth the price oh no no! Because of humble bundle I was able to donate to a good cause AND get an amazing game that's worth way more than what they're charging to be honest.  A good thing to keep in mind is this game is like a box of 100 games. Many of which I've been able to play over and over with the fun increasing over time rather than dying down like old games. If you're bored of a game or would rather play something else, just select a new board game, take a little time to learn it and boom!    Pros:"
 Early Access Review
"Really good game, never gets old because almost any board game you can think of can be played in this game. Amazing value really.   I only half-heartedly bought it when it was in early access, but this game has exceeded all expectations. I thought it would be hard to get people to obey the rules if they're given an open environment, turns out that wasn't a problem at all. Trolls &amp; griefers are rare, and a host can easily ban and fix any damage done in seconds by rewinding time."
"DND? Got it. Checkers? Got it. Chess? Got it. Star Wars X Wing? Got it. Star Wars Imperial Assault?? Got it. Coup? Got it. Secret Hitler?..yes even Secret Hitler..   Seriously. Awesome Game! Convince your friends to download, load up some ole fashioned game fun and have at it.. or flip the table until everyone leaves, up to you."
If you enjoy board games this is a must own. You can play pretty much any board game ever created thanks to steam workshop and a great community or create your very own board games. Devs are always working on new updates and add features that the community asks for which is unheard of now a days.
"It allows you to play whatever board game, card game, or even tabletop RPG that you can think up/find on the workshop. A friend and I bought this then spent over and hour playing Dragon Ball Guess Who. The game allows the host to bring up the mod from the workshop then invite friends to play with even if they don't have the mod already. It [the mod] will download for them before they enter. No hassle, easy to use, super fun sandbox."

"Tabletop Simulator is really a hard thing to review, as it is really what you make it to be. The sole purpose as to why I got this was for the Tabletop Roleplaying aspect of it. I am a Game Master and have found many ways to use this before or during my game sessions. I am the founder of the Tabletop RPG Gamers League, a Group that is made up of people, players of tabletop/pen and paper games, and I definitely recommend this to all fo them. Anyway, lets continue on to the pros and cons lists NOTE-This review is based solely on the RPG/Game Master features and uses for Tabletop Simulator.  Pros-  Unlimited Features, you can do literally do whatever you want to with this thing. If Tabletop Simulator doesn't have an asset that you need like a castle piece or knight model, you can just make one! It literally has unlimited potential for all of your Game Master needs.  Consistent Updates, the developers are still expanding the base resources, specifically the RPG assets. This is great news for those interested in these assets, us Game Masters that is.  Multiplayer, you can literally play your favorite tabletop game with your friends using this game, either through the internet or using hotseat gameplay. For the internet part, connecting is very easy and allows the Game Master to set the rules.  Many others, but lets continue to cons...  Cons-  Complicated Controls, the controls are not to simple for beginners, remembering which button does what is hard early on. Once you have played with the controls for a while you will get a feel for them. The tutorial tells you how to use the controls, but thats about it.  Inefficient Menus, finding the piece you are looking for takes to long, not because they are hard to find, but because you have to search through the menu, then sub menus, then more sub menus. It just takes to long, but I can live with it for now, although it would be nice to eventually change the menu set up. I guess you will never be able to reproduce a real tabletop session 100% in a virtual game.  Conclusion- Overall, this is perhaps at the moment the best and most realistic means in recreating the actual feel of tabletop gaming, not just roleplaying games, but any game. I believe that this could eventually become the standard for PC tabletop roleplaying, and look forward to seeing what the developers do with this. This is a must have for any Game Master, or anyone who just really likes playing tabletop games!  May your adventures be many and always end in reward! -Donoknight, Founder of Tabletop RPG Gamers League"
"An oddly good timewaster, Tabletop Simulator is the simulator to buy if you want to play tabletop games. The controls feel a little wonky but oddly they work really well with lots of undo options should something spectacular screw up. There's also perhaps the best feature: table flipping. Also easily undoable.  Anyway if you have friends or family far away and want to play games like yahtzee, monopoly, chess, checkers, snakes and ladders you name it in a 3D style game and not in some glitchy 2D flash game with questionable ads you found on a Google search, this is the game to get. It doesn't require a lot of computer power to run and, with some coaching, may even be easy enough for your grandparents to use. Mine got the hang of chess anyway. It's also a lot of fun being able to play a game like yu gi oh and have every single card available even if it's a challenge sifting through all ten thousand of them.  Overall highly recommended, this simulator is better than I ever would have expected"
"Great game with a ton of very well crafted and very silly user generated content. From anime Top Trumps to Borderlands 2 Monopoly, there is certainly no shortage of things to play.  Only downside is the game does not simulate rules, so if you're unfamiliar with a game you're going to have to learn the rules yourself."
"Tabletop SImulator is a game in which you can play, create and bond over games which are conventionally unplayable due to distances between people. The amount of creativity and unique situations this game provides is immense and every time you start the game it is a unique and entertaining experience. I highly reccomend this game to those who seek to have some casual fun while laughing it up with friends or strangers. Somehow, both seem a lot closer when you get to know them over a casual board game. If you enjoyed playing G-Mod, you will definately enjoy Tabletop Simulator."
a great game for anyone who likes tabletop games or who like to flip tables.

I never actually knew how to play 12 person chess. This game taught me how
"Tabletop Simulator is a pretty cool experience. You can basically build or play any game you want. The Steam community has created some pretty cool games and items in the Workshop. Though if you want to create something 3D then you better have some computer modeling knowledge. I also like the feature where I can import my own playing cards or pieces or boards. Though I did try to make a disk type 'card', I used a .png with a transparent background and when I imported the file, the transparency was filled with black making it a square card. I'm still trying to figure out the card importing thing, since when I imported a card type, it became very pixelated and illegible... But I've seen games on the Steam Workshop where the cards are very clean... SO - one of these days I'll get that result. But overall, this simulates what it's like to be at a real table and the games that you can play or create are endless, and they go as far as your imagination."

Since the information era, you've been brainwashed to think it was impossible, but it is. 10 adults, who know nothing about each other, playing a game of uno, it makes you realize how amazing this world is. Even in a game, a game where these people can be playing the 'Shoot' games, or out going to a bar and getting slamed. They play Uno, with a bunch of strangers from around the world.

If you want to virtually play board games and watch stupid YouTube videos on an iPad with your friends you should get this.
This game is very addictive. I just recieved a gtx 970 card last week and can't stop playing this instead of other titles. If you like chatting with friends or others online while playing your favourite board game then this is it. It also helps that the creators are always making new updates and it's all free. Pick this up you won't be dissapointed.
"Best table flipping simulator since Table Flipping Simulator 2006.  Edit: Table Flipper 2012 came close to being a better table flipping simulator, but Tabletop Simulator is still the best."
"I use this game to play things such as munchkin, water deep , settlers of Catan and Dungeons &amp; Dragons. I am quickly approaching more hours in this game than any other game I've ever played. I think the only game I've ever played longer was planet side planet side two, EverQuest and EverQuest two. I have spent hours in this game just creating levels for the adventures I take other people on. I can think of no other game that has allowed me to create fun for others In a way that this game has. This is truly one of the best games I have ever owned not because it's particularly fun to play, but because it allows me to truly play with others in such a way that most MMO's cannot I hope to achieve."
"Incredibly amazing game to play when you're learning a board game or card game that you otherwise would not be able to play, as well as playing any tabletop game with friends anywhere in the world!  Highly recommended, workshop is fairly active with a supportive and creative community."
This simulator is AMAZING. Especially once you realize all the great games that can played from the workshop!
A bit of a learning curve to understand how all the tools work and how to do everything but this is great for playing board games or d&amp;d with friends. Me and my friends are hooked on playing all sorts of stuff. This game heavily relies on you using the workshop since that is where you get most of the content for this game but I have to say this is a awesome tool to use for playing board games with people you can't all meet up with irl.

"This game is legit. The mechanics are functional but the games in the Workshop really make it. Ever wanted to try an interesting game but the cost of entry ($25-60 and up) is too high? Friends not geographically close enough for tabletop games? This game is PERFECT for solving either of those issues. Not all games are available and/or free, but there is a huge selection so check it out!"

"One of the best investments I have ever made through steam. You are basically paying 19.99 USD for literally EVERY boardgame you could possibly want to play with your friends. From Checkers to D&amp;D there are mods created through the steam workshop for just about any game that can be played on a table. I have played alot of classic games and learned some new ones as well! I am currently addicted to 'Secret Hitler', one of the best hidden identity games I have ever played!   If you like tabletop games and have friends,     BUY IT  "
Play almost any board game ever made with anyone in the world.
"I am absolutely in love with Tabletop Simulator. I was initially hesitant to buy it for the $20 price tag and wanted to wait for it to come up for sale before getting it, but my group and I really wanted to get started on a Pathfinder campaign and I'm incredibly impatient. This has been worth every cent so far, There are an amazing number of really well done models on the workshop and building maps is much easier than I thought it would be. It's still time consuming, but once you get the hang of what to do and how to move and arrange pieces, it's really intuitive and works out really well.  My campaign is going great. The players love it, and TTS really makes it feel like we're all around a table in a room together instead of miles apart. We've tried out lots of other tabletop programs to try and get the group going, but none of them felt as real as this one has and it's added a different element to tabletop gaming that other programs have fallen short of for me and my group. The controls make DMing so simple, and honestly the only thing I can think to improve right now would be the ability to draw more defined fog of war instead of just the squares. Workshop support is A+ and I have had zero problems retrieving items I've subscribed to.  Overall, I cannot recommend this high enough to other pen and paper RPG groups. Having the 3d maps and being able to decorate the world with flavor items has been a real treat. I can honestly spend hours upon hours in game doing nothing but building."
"The physics of this engine along with your ability to create almost any board game makes this an amazing investment. Just remember you may want to get your friends into this too, otherwise all you have a new way to play solitaire."
"The interface is a little intimidating at first, but you soon realize that is has to be, as the fone-tuned control it gives you is necessary to make this a shockingly immersive experience. Honestly I love it to death, and once I got the hang of it I saw the future of virtual gaming possibilities. The only downside I have is finding people I know who are willing to actually breech the learning curve with me :/  Regardless, I would love for this to grow and develop, and see more things like it. Fantastic in theory and execution."
"If you like tabletop games then you HAVE to like this game. It simulates a tabletop and you have to follow the rules for the game, so house rules are accepted here. Also it's an easy way to get together with friends for a few games when you can't schedule a game night. They keep adding in features to make sure the game matches up with what you need to play diffent games, like blindfolding, teams, and even scripting so someone else can make things easier for you by writing that script. Hosting a server is built in, there is kick and ban options, the only thing this game is missing is an FOV slider, but you don't need one. the FOV is fine. I have nothing bad to say about this game.  Pros: everything  Cons: none"
"What's that, All of your buddies live in completely diffrent parts of the world but you really wanna play a tabletop game with all of them ? Well, it's not an issue anymore thanks to Tabletop Sim.  Secret hitler,DnD,Star Wars X-Wing,BattleStar:Galactica,Monopoly,Risk,Uno and whatever you wish you can play thanks to the great dedicated community that keeps bringing tons of real board games into Tabletop Sim for free via the game's modding workshop.  If you see Tabletop Simulator during a sale and have a bunch of online friends who are also interested in playing tabletop games then i suggest picking up the 4 pack when it's 50% off, it's totally frekin' worth it."

"  Quick, easy and efficient way to drive your friends to insanity. 10/10 - highly recommend"
"Don't expect that it's immediately playable. It is exactly what it says on the tin, and like any other tabletop game or collection thereof, you will need to learn to make it into what you think fun is. If you're willing to put in that work, then you will not be disappointed.   Down-sides: all your players need to buy the simulator, too, and there's an annoying public chat channel that I haven't yet figured out how to silence. Up-sides: If you have creativity and determination, there is no limit to what you can do."
"Tabletop Simulator is pretty cool if you have friends. I had to convince roughly three people to buy this game so I'd have someone to play it with, for one person I had to buy it for them and gift it. Once they got it though, they definitely enjoyed it. Using the workshop for content, you can play all sorts of games. It's especially useful if the friends you do have are too lazy to come over to play a board game. You can just play it at your computer; most any game you want for only twenty dollars. Overall good game 10/10, need more friends though."

"Don't get me wrong, I hate all these indie 'simulator' games, too! However, Tabletop Simulator was a huge surprise to me! It's actually a very innovative gameplay idea!   Play on servers with your friends (or even meet new people) and just play some tabletop games! Cards, board games, and trinkets are only a few things capable of being played in this software. Plus, with integrated Steam Workshop support, you're able to create or download your own mods and games that you can play online!   So, what are you waiting for?! Buy this now, and make some new friends! :D"

"It's the natural progression you'd expect to happen from real-life tabletop games sliding on into the virtual world. I wouldn't recommend this game if you plan on playing with strangers, but when you're with friends- it's just like the real thing. It's hilarious and fun, but the game runs on honesty since it's quite literally a simulator- allowing you to flip the table in a fit of rage, or steal another person's cards right out of their hand, or plop down a tablet on the table only to open up a web browser to bring up hardcore gay porn. I'd say Card Against Humanity is the most popular thing to play in this Simulator, but the game offers to many games you can play, even tabletop RPG crap.

"Linux users: DO NOT BUY  A big part of this game is being able to download assets from arbitrary web servers. The https client included in the Linux version of TTS isn't able to connect to a modern TLS 1.2 web server. It seems the https client is only able to download assets from https servers running SSLv3.  SSLv3 has been deprecated since the October 14, 2014  [security.googleblog.com] , so the Linux version of this game has been broken for over two years at this point. Many of the most popular game assets are stored on https-only web servers which makes it impossible to play many of the games available in the online multiplayer lobby without manually downloading the assets outside of TTS.  So far the devs seem to be blaming upstream game engine issues  which isn't really acceptable for something as simple as scripting https requests."

"I got this as a gift from my wishlist for Christmas and had no idea how much I would enjoy it. The workshop is immense and the quality for most items is close to perfect. This is a great tool for getting into many types of games as you can pull up a digital copy and go through the rules right at your computer. I think the list price is worth it just for that feature. Add in all the games you can play and the solid growing community, and you have a must buy in my opinion. I love you Tabletop Simulator."
This game is just too much fun if you really enjoy board games. As many of us have friends all over the world and this game is a fantastic way to have fun together and have a good laugh. There are ton of board games that you can play and most of them you can find by browsing through the workshop. Multiplayer is great and supports up to 8 players. The developers are doing a awesome job keeping us informed and updating the game hopefully they keep up the good work. I was honestly surprised how amazing this game is and it is definitely worth every penny.
Proving once again that your friends cant be trusted with the simplest tasks.

Tabletop Simulator is a great game to play with friends!   Theres so many games to chose from in the workshop.   But..   It's also one of the most frustrating games whenever your friends choose to flip the table during the game..
"Amazing game that is well worth the money! Playing board games on Tabletop Simulator doesn't feel as shallow as it would when you play other online board games. I like that you have to move and keep track of everything yourself.   This is a blast to play with a group of people! With tons of content available in the workshop, I can see myself playing this for a very long time. It is even easy to recreate games of your choosing since the included deck editor basically does the work for you.   If you love board games, I highly recommend.  No jump scares but many table flips so make sure to lock down the table to keep everyone on their best behavior."

"One of the best value games on steam, $20 for thousands of games (with mods, and if someone with the mod hosts the game you dont even need to download the mod). Any game you can think of that can be played on a table probably has a mod for it for this game. You can also flip the table whenever you're playing with someone who is a damned cheater!  It also looks nice on the vive. I like how you can adjust your size and shrink down and stand on the table surrounded by giant pieces.  "
"Do you like tabletop games irl ? well then this is for you, this game offers alot of card games,board games and more! With workshop its easy to download any game you want to play and invite a friend to play.Also good if you dont got any irl friends and dont want to play boardgames alone :("
OMG! this is like a dream come true because I moved away from my gaming friends and want to still play with them and now i can! BUY THIS GAME!

"Tabletop Simulator is the best thing of any kind on Steam. Everyone with a brain should get it. Right now. No, seriously, this is the best thing ever. I'm not joking. Tabletop Simulator is the best Internet Poker in the world, and would be worth it for that alone. But that's just barely scratching the surface of what this thing can do. What can it do? Everything man. It's like Garry's Mod for board games, only much easier to figure out. It is also a killer app in VR. This is the Holodeck. The Holodeck is real, and it's called Tabletop Simulator.  (Editing to remove 'Early Access' tag from this review. It was worth it back then and has only gotten better since)"

"Worth every penny. You can play any possible game imaginable on this. Set up a server to play with friends, or join a public server and play with randoms. Its a great time if you like card/board games."
"Awesome simulator that lets you play a seemingly endless variety of tabletop games, with anyone around the world! Having owned this simulator for over a year now, it's clear to see the care the developers give to the game, and are still making updates and changes to this day!"
"Buy Tabletop, yeah?"
"Really overall great game and for online, great community. The mods are great at keeping it family friendly and other players are great at teaching players new games. Pretty amazing the way you can make your own games or find childhood games from the workshop to play with friends or pubs, and have an iPad out on he table and listen to YouTube for hours. For a video game, this is as realistic it can get for having fun with card and board games. The best touch is flipping the table at the end. My friends and I have way more fun on here than we thought we would."
"Where to begin,   This game is just so much fun and I've only scratched the surface of this game. Of course there are your trolls that flipped tables but thats not a big deal and thats probably the worst part. I bought 3 copies of this game, for me and my two other friends and they both love it as well. We are currently in a monopoly session that has been lasting for hours. If you take a look at our board you'll see that it's completely vandilzed with drawings of just craziness and we still play seriously. Once you're in a serious game it'll be hard for you to leave.  You won't get bored playing board games anymore!"

"This game is great because the possibilities are endless. Just like the game title says, virtually anything can be played that requires top of a table. The mods is where it’s at. With more than 8,000 mods available you can find a lot of most popular board games, so you can play them for free instead of actually buying the physical copies. But to play this game, you definitely need some friends. If you don’t have any you could probably find people to play with on forums or within the game itself. Tabletop Simulator is an excellent time killer if you want to relax, chat, laugh, and have fun with your friends."

"Worth buying for late night poker and other shenanigans with your best friends who live too far away. Especially midnight shenanigans, it's worth exploring. DLC or not."
"Really great game if you enjoy tabletop card or board games, stuff with physics on them and playing with random strangers from around the world. You can literally play everything you want, you can even make your own decks and boards! You can also browse the internet from an iPod in-game and play Youtube music for everyone or watch videos and everything else you could do on a browser. I highly recommend you try it out, it's on sale right now!  Really fun game with limitless freedom 10/10!"
 TL;DR
Played a jigsaw puzzle with hot chick on it and shrek version of chutes and ladders  4 puzzle peices out of 4
"This software is always evolving and the way game developper/publishers can also use this software to promote/sell their games is making it a very interesting option.  I consider this a tool for games; as it is supporting as many as you can think of as long as it plays on a table and by rounds. Kind-of.   I would say in solo to make/test your own or make table maps for your latest RPG levels it is great and really relaxing. It comes with its own editor if you can come up with a stable image hosting site (yes unfortunately it seems it won't rely entirely to Steam workshop to host pictures but I can understand why if we want to develop later games and retain ownership). It can also be played hot seat as many folks turn by turn in the same house. And finally, when microphone functions don't bug one way or another (but it can be resolved using Steam voice chat), do a whole 2 to 8 players game. You can add to that a spectator and a GM if RPG is your thing!  I can say, for nostalgic folks of the time we met all in the same house to have a real game night gathering without smart phone on the side, but empeched by being far away from familly and friends, or in hospital, or contagious etc... It is great to break distance limitation and isolation.  There are many great features I would like to review here but, I still continue to find them as I go and more features were added since I bought it and since I continue to play it.  I would love to buy an additional 4 pack this Christmass, except... as I learned from Steam, once we have a copy the 4 pack must go to someonelse that you have to enthrust to regift the additional 3 copies to the rest of your friends you were hoping to make the gift. It is truely the only minus part of it.  Apart that, TTS is just what you will make out of it. ^^ Make of it a good use!"
Settelers of Catan One Night Ultimate Werewolf  + ---------------------------------  7.3 hours on this game
"After all this time, I will give this game a thumbs up because I believe this is the quintessential party game everyone that uses steam every other day should have. This game is what you make it. If you chose to not be social, not make a mod, not use other mods, afraid to learn rules, or afraid to host games, You will not get anything out of this game. This game is a great tool to have sit down time with friends and playboard games or even learn new boardgames since the workshop is littered with the biggest selection I've seen in a long time. But due to the game not having a great way to find common interest amongst strangers and a lot of servers are passworded. I'd recommend this game if you are a tabletop enthusiast or a friend wanting to buy the 4 pack."
"Can be extremely fun with a group of friends, don't buy this game if it's just you getting it."

"This game is difficult to review because it's almost positive in a lot of ways. The best way I could put it is, Tabletop Simulator can be reviewed based on how much you enjoy other tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons, Warhammer, Secret Hitler, Cards Against Humanity and even Monopoly. Tabletop Simulator resembes a application specialized in mimicry. It's a faceless manupilator, it takes the form of any thing you want like a 6IV Ditto from Pokemon. It captures you attention, you purchase it thinking it's great until you realize, there's nothing to fancy about it. That is, until you realize you can literally pirate any game ever, import it into its file directory and it just takes of from there, it becomes your life now- for a little while.   How did I get into MTG? Tabletop Simulator. How did I get into Warhammer lore? Tabletop Simulator. How did I get into Secret Hitler? Tabletop Simulator. I am telling you, as long there are trending tabletop games out there, Tabletop Simulator will always be something we cherish and something tabletop developers want to remand but really should be thanking for all that free advertisement!"
"let me start by saying WOW, first off, the games available in the Workshop are the ♥♥♥♥ing BACKBONE of this game.  the Sheer amount of fun you can have with this game is Astounding. because well, its a tabletop simulator, that one thing you would do with friends if you werent too lazy and cheap to get up and go play games with friends. that being said, please have friends to play with, this is a basic part of games that involve more than one person. other people. i wish I WISH i could upload the 3 hour video of us playing the Pokemon drinking game, which in and of itself was worth the price of this game. please PLEASE do not let companies ruin this great game. im not paying $65 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars for a digital settlers of cataan simulator. this game is good as is, sure there some features that could be improved of, none of which i remember when im sober, this game is probably one of my favorite things about steam. 10/10 would share a drink with simulator"

"If you like having a good time with friends online, buy this game and get your friends to buy it too.   Pros:    Includes pretty much every tabletop or board game known to man. Just get them from the Steam Workshop;   Developers are close to the community, hear our suggestions and frequently put out new updates to the game;   Allows you to make your own game (if you have a physical board game, you can even scan the cards/boards and import them into Tabletop Simulator);   Servers are populated with people playing all kinds of games;   Community is generally mature and respectful, and people are usually willing to teach the rules of any game.    Cons:    Ticket To Ride is not on Tabletop Simulator because there is already a PC Game for Ticket To Ride on Steam.   Playing with only 1 computer and other people in the same room is not practical.   Friends not included.  "

"Best video game purchase of the year.  I love board games. I have closets full of all sorts of games. The problem is that I don't have closets full of local friends.  Everyone got married and or had kids and moved away or grew up, so my pool of potential friends to actually hang out with has been significantly reduced over recent years.  This game allows my friends and I to get together and play some games again!  A buddy of mine backed 'Kingdom Death: Monster' as a kickstart project, and we've been waiting to try it out for a long time. Over the holidays, he came home to visit and we played. It was incredible. Now we can play it on TTS, too. Excellent.  I have a crap-load of Heroscape sets, but it's a pain to get people together and deal with al the set-up/take-down time. This game makes it possible to play Heroscape again. Another check mark.  Really, if you like board games, you need this."

"One of my favorite hobbies is to play board games. I have collected over 30 different titles in the few years I have been playing with friends. Table Top Simulator is the best use for your money if you enjoy playing tabletop games AND I highly encourage having your friends buy copies as well if it's hard to get everyone together to physically play games like myself. The developers have done an amazing job at making it feel like you're sitting around a real table playing your favorite games, the controls are highly intuitive and the game runs extremely smooth!   Would flip the table again! 11/10"
"Imagine your favorite board game, in 3D, on your PC, with legit multiplayer. No more wasting time resetting props or putting anything away. A lot of famous board games are available on the workshop including Monopoly and Scrabble. Oddly enough this game also includes a set of tools: A calculator, a tablet that has a built in web browser based on chrome, a digital clock, notes, even a music player that looks like a common MP3 player. These tools can be spawned in multiplayer by the host which can be very helpful.  It's very well optimised, doesn't eat ram and doesn't overstress your graphics card. Me and my friend spent  7 hours  playing board games when I got the game last night(12/22/2015). I gotta say, I'm impressed."
"I absolutely love, love, LOOOOVE this game. I have weekly game nights with my best friends and we drink and hop on Tabletop Simulator and mess around. My favorite so far has been the original Pokemon Master Trainer, which is only a workshop download but goodness, it is super nostalgic!"

"I remember seeing this game being featured on the Steam Store. After that, I immediately bought it for myself, and a copy for a friend. Tabletop Simulator has nice physics, and perfect gameplay. Although this was a game about playing games, which let you throw pieces around and screw up the board, playing games is easy, as the game will correct your piece to the nearest slot when you set down a game piece. The game already comes with a few different modes, such as Chess, Checkers, Chinese Checkers, RPG set, Reversi, Poker, Solitaire, etc. Along with these different modes, the modding community on the Steam Workshop makes new content for my friends and I to play, and constantly adds to the amount of gameplay content for the game. I've downloaded many mods, such as 3 player chess, Risk, Battle of Burgundy, and many more. At some point, I tried to convince another friend to buy it, but he refused, so I just gifted a copy to him.  Tabletop Simulator is a great game, with all types of board games packed into one video game. I would absolutely recommend this to a friend."

Now I can finally play all these board and card games I love with the friends I've made on the internet. Whom also love these games.
"It's a fun way to play board games with friends who live far away.  My first impression was that the game is a little clunky, and it is. But it captures the charm of actually sitting around a table playing a game, in a way that other online board games do not. Playing board games with friends is more about the social experience than about rock-solid competitive play IMO, so I'll take some clunkiness in exchange for that charm.  The workshop integration is awesome and also helps makes the game."

"Have you ever found yourself playing a video game and thinking to yourself, 'I wish I was playing a board game instead, like the good ol' days.'   No?  ...oh. Me neither.  ...Well I mean if it's on sale for $5 and you've got a few friends to play it while while you chat over Skype I guess. The reason why video games are nice is because they have rulesets programmed into them, with board games you have to do all of the busy work yourself: moving pieces to specific locations carefully, doing all of the calculations and math in your head, trying not to accidentally break the rules or mess something up, and resisting the urge to revert to your childhood instincts of wanting to flip the board over.  Rating: Worth $5. Wait for a steam sale."

"This game seems like it's quite a bit of fun. But that's just not true. It's a ♥♥♥♥-ton of fun.  Chess, Uno, Exploding Kittens, Cards Against Humanity,Secret Hitler or just throwing pieces across the customized table.  Place a picture of Hulk Hogan next to you for moral support or play in zero gravity.  I waste a lot of time with all those gimmicks and I'm not regretting it.  Make sure to check out the Workshop for stuff that fits your taste. 10/10 would have this game gifted to me again. "
"Tabletop Simulator is the quintessential computer program for virtual computer rendering and computing of a real world tabletop. I find this the perfect piece of software for those who cannot afford a real tabletop. I don't just mean your kitchen countertop. No; this game, with its genius programming and opitmization in tandem with your graphics card, calculating hundreds of millions of different floating point operations quicker than you can blink an eye, has the ability to simulate just about any kind of tabletop.  Mahogany? Of course.  Fine Grain Oak? Even Call of Duty can do that. C'mon.  Oil-Treated Maple with a Spruce Trim? You bet your buttons it can simulate that.  Round Glass with an Angled Trim? Yessiree, even non wood materials!  Reverse Grain Ash Wood with a Thin Veneer? Possiby, if you've got that new GTX 980 or whatever.   This is perfect for those who cannot afford these fine pieces of art many may refer to as 'tabletops' in the real world, or for those people who wish to expand thier horizons and experience different types of tabletops and don't have the extra money or space in real life to spend on such glorius tabletops."

"I was able to play Eels and Escalators. 100/10, would play Eels and Escalators again!  In all seriousness, this game is great for people who don’t have any friends in real life. Even if you do have friends, the game is still pretty great!! Anyway, I went into this game expecting it to be pretty bad. Well, not really “bad”, more like stupid. I expected it to be pretty stupid. However, after some “experimentation” – we’ll say “experimentation”, but you can call it whatever you’d like – I’ve been having a lot of fun with it. I love board games, you see… Yeah, I know; who doesn’t love board games, right? Anyway, I like board games a lot and I like playing board games. My problem is, the group I usually play with doesn’t like the “complexity” of the games I usually tend to like playing. I use the term “complexity” loosely because my games aren’t very “complex”, but they are more complex than say something like Uno, Monopoly, or Skip-Bo. Anyway, I’m starting to digress. Point being, the game is great and you should play it if you’re either: A. Into board games B. Into board games and don’t have anybody to play with C. Into board games and have anybody/somebody to play with D. Into board games (again)… This game is just great! E. Or if you just like good games.  Oh, and don’t let the name Tabletop SIMULATOR fool you… This is by far the best SIMULATOR out there, or at least one of the best. "
"9/10   **PROS** -Original and relaxing environment. -Endless fun (if you have the patience). -Good community and groups to find a game fast. -Infinite modding and posibilities. -Built-in voice chat.  **CONS** -More friends = More fun. No friends = Boring. You might have to convince your mates to buy a copy or make new friends in-game.  -90% of servers are locked, making it even harder to find a game and make friends. -Slow loading times sometimes and can be buggy/laggy. -STEEP LEARNING CURVE (especially when it comes to creating custom content and learning all the controls). -Game is a bit expensive full-price.  Conclusion: Buy the game and add me on Steam. "
Tabletop Simulator is as cool as you think it is.  Buy 4 and get your friends around the virtual dinner table
Imagine being able to play any board game you can imagine. Only DIGITALLY.  Now imagine a bunch of user generated content the likes of which is almost unheard of.  Now imagine an icecream cone riding a unicycle singing carmina burana / o fortuna.   is good.
"  Let me tell you about my experience with Tabletop Simulator (or TTS for short).. I managed to convince three of my buddies to get the game because it was on sale, They were skeptical, but after I showed them the Steam Workshop support, they were feeling pretty open about the idea. We download the mod for Smash Up and get in a match to start playing, we create our decks and begin the game. Everything was good until one of my buddies, Zach, found out there was a 'Flick' option, and proceeded to flick all the cards, point counters, etc. Then another one of my friends, Jason, downloaded a mod and changed the background to a 3D Anime Cafe. Then I followed by making the greatest discovery of my life, I spawned a tablet... It was like discovering the internet all over again, we did everything, played flash games, watch YouTube, porn, and we even loaded an old YouTube video I made when i was 8. We were entertained for hours, and it was complete anarchy, There's a seemingly endless amount of activites to take part in while playing TTS, and for $20 ($10 if you get it during the Summer Steam Sale), I can easily say that it is definitely worth it, just think of all the money you'll save from paying for expensive board games!!  4/20 - Too Much Water"
"Me and four friends bought this game under the idea that we all wanted to play baord games together...but 3 of those friends really only wanted to spawn random pieces and flip the table. The game is fine, you just need to have people who actually want to play it."
Cards Against Humanity . Cards Against Humanity never changes !!! 10/10

Fun game to play and chill with friends!
"Made a new review after playing with the Vive. Honestly, if you have a Vive, this is a must-have. You can play it almost the same on a Vive as on a keyboard, and better than that, you can go to keyboard and play it normally if you don't like it in VR, and the game is still equally great. This is easily one of the best games on Steam regardless of VR. It is played just as advertised.  Play with your friends, play anything, and play for a while."
"As a modder and tabletop gaming enthusiast, I'm totally in love with this videogame. The controls feel incredibly natural and, thanks to Steam Workshop support, there's a huge number of different board and card games to choose from. Back in the day I held regular tabletop gaming nights with a group of equally dedicated friends, now I don't feel the need to ever leave my room again. Thanks Berserk Games! Be sure to buy the 4-pack though, since it's cheaper and playing with your friends is more fun than playing with strangers."

Why buy every board game/card game in the world when you can pay 10$(during the summer sale) and play all of them.
10/10 it's as good as your favourate board game
Best simulator ever! For Any mods and original games the best choice!
 Early Access Review
"As many before me have already said, Tabletop Simulator is less a game than it is a tool for playing games. The base game includes your standard tabletop classics, including playing cards, dominoes, and chess and checkers sets, but you can download other games from the workshop, such as Monopoly, Uno, and Cards Against Humanity. While the singleplayer part of the game is fine, with things such as jigsaw puzzles and solitaire, the options are limited. Playing with at least one other person opens up many more options, such as Chess, Checkers, Go, and multi-player card games, and it's even more fun playing a big game with a group of friends or even with other random people online. At $20, the price is rather steep and it's probably a good idea to wait for a sale, but if you think about it, it only costs as much as an actual board game or two. That said, Tabletop Simulator is very good, and I recommend it. Play on!"

"So pretty much play whatever board game you want, but without other irl people in your house. Great! People are typically chill, physics engine works, a ridiculous amount of keyboard shortcuts that do things you probably wish you knew about since you did things manually on your first few sessions, play Warhammer 40k without spending the equivalent of the United States' national debt on models. Yea. You should get it if you like board games. Or mini golf. Or card games. Or tablets. Or, well, you get the point.   10/10 would slowly explain Cards Against Humanity to foreigners again."
"I purchased this game when it was only $10. Fell in love. All my friends want to get it now. Only problem is the game no longer costs $10. For what you get, I understand the $20 pricetag but to me this has always been a $10 game. Still fantastic though. Will continue playing as soon as more of my friends actually purchase the game."

"10/10. Great for everyone. I've spent many hours in this game with my buddy playing countless numbers of workshop mods and laughing my ♥♥♥ off. All hands down, the best part of the game is it's flexibility to become almost anything you want it to be. For example, my friend and I will start up a random game and end up drawing the entire time. If we're not drawing we're watching things together on the in-game tablet. It's a very, very cool sandbox game."

Great game for D&amp;D and other board games^^.
"If you are looking for tabletop games this is the one to get, the workshop has got every game you can imagine plus more, its also great to meet people, or you can even just play solo. All in All this game has close to infinite replayability."
Do you like board games? are your friends too busy or too far to play them with you? Have no friends to play your favorite board game? (much like me.....) Then why haven't you bought this yet?!?!  But in all seriousness. This is a well made simulator and it is far from 'perfect' but it does bridge the gap from playing in real life to playing a video game version of the board game. (like say small world)  Never the less it is a better play experience then say Vassel and i recommend this program for anyone who loves a good board game.
"Played on both Xbox 360 and Xbone, but it didn't last half as long as this. 60fps really makes a difference. Everything runs smoothly and I see no significant bugs or anything worth noting, aside from connection problems once in a while, dropping me into empty lobbies, but perhaps that's on my side. The ones who made this did a really great job on this one!"
&gt;Plays chess with friend &gt;Loses &gt;Just like all of 4th grade. &gt;Just like that one day in 8th grade &gt;Finally can flip table &gt;Flips table &gt;A few games of stuff later &gt;Logs off &gt;Tries out tablet &gt;Awhile passes &gt;Writes this &gt;Regrets not writing this on tablet.  10/10 would tablet again.

This is very well made.   Sadly I can´t use it - I don´t have any friends. D:
"A good test of Tabletop Simuator on Steam is . . . can it handle the various game elements of a classic social board game like Cosmic Encounter® and is the Tabletop Simulator evironment a place where the game can be played easily and naturally, just like you were sitting at a table playing a game of Cosmic with your friends?  It can and does. Passing with flying colors! Plus you can play with anyone anywhere in the world at anytime, talk to and hear other players, save games to complete later, and bring in your own homebrew aliens to test and play.  As one of the original designers of Cosmic Encounter I am thankful for all the skill and hard work by Berserk Games to create this wonderful environment for our game.  Also, a note for game designers - this is a perfect environment to use for creating and play testing new game concepts."
"Part of what makes this such a great platform for gaming is the community who has added in so many mods for it. It's a great way to try board games before you want to invest in them or play games digitally that you own physically. While it doesn't have EVERYTHING (and it shouldn't), its got plenty of great choices."
"Anything you can do on your table at home, you can do virtually in  Tabletop Simulator.  Other than eating dinner. Still waiting for that to be implemented."
With one purchase I added over 6700 more games to my backlog.

Awesome game if you like trading card games and or table top games. Bring friends for the best experience
The steam workshop items give even more games (even some you might be considering buying so you can try them out before you buy them).
"Wow!... big surprise this one :)  Two words to describe TS: 'Pure Creativity' It took me some tutorials on YouTube to learn how to create my own stuff... (Internet connection required most of the time)  This game has all the (tabletop) games you can imagine and more!!! The only thing it lacks is A.I. to play with, but yet, Highly Recommendable!!!"
"I rarely post reviews, but this game is so inovative and simple in concept that it excites me in a way games have not done in a long while.   The fact that this game lets you play tabletop games using purely physic mechanics and no actual programed game logic makes it by far the best way for modern board games to digitize their products and I really hope they take this software on board and really consider using it as a few already have.   To explain the physics vs. game logic. Take monopoly for example, when you play the digital monopoly games, home rules like 'all taxes and monies paid goes in the middle, land on free parking and you take it all' just doesn't exist and there is no way to add it. When you play purely in physics, you are not bound by the game code and you have the same freedom as you would have with your friends around a normal table with the board game in front of you.   With that in mind, this game allows me to play tabletop games (Mistfall being one of my favourites) with friends without them having to work travel time arround their schedule, or even without caring about distance at all, being countries or continents apart.   Overall, it is a simple concept that is executed just about as well as it could be. To reiterate, this game excites me more than the new HiTMAN returning to openworld maps, more than MGSV's first foray into open world (and if you know me, those two mean a LOT) and the execution really sets it off on the right foot. Game designers, take note and jump on board if you can."
"You can play anything, create anything or just download from the workshop. I just had a blast testing it out and don't think it will bore me any time soon!  great game because of the freedom it gives, you buy your childhood now for only 10 euros!  do give it a try, you will not be dissapointed"
The perfect game if you have no friends.
"A very fun and accessible game that actually correctly boasts the title of 'simulator' for once rather than using it as an excuse to have a non-functional physics engine with brainless gameplay. I actually learned how to play Blackjack quite well thanks to this game. My only real complaint is that if you want the most out of this game, you'll need friends to play it with, and if you're as socially dysfunctional as I am, that may be hard. Otherwise, a great title full of possibilities, especially if you're a sucker for tabletops irl like me."
"Great with friends, but only with friends because public lobby's are a mess"
love this game ! kinda sucks if theres a lot of moving peices but other than that its great. Big plus when everyone cant go to one persons house to play.
"To be honest, i thought about creating a game using unity 3D for table games a year ago, but when i saw this game, i was really amazed that my idea was succesful and this game is really well made. good job :)"
"&gt;Play Magic the Gathering,get rekt,flip table,get banned,rinse &amp; repeat 10/10 best game ever "
"First and foremost, this is a sandbox game. The game does not enforce any game rules so you are free to do what you like. What makes this game great is the sheer amount of games users have created or imported into the steam workshop. The community is also pretty friendly and open to teaching others how to play board games. The game supports ingame voice chat which really helps in explaining the rules and gameplay."
"More fun than playing tabletop games for real! No need to clean up afterwards, either!"
"This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I bought this on Winter Sale 2015 for $10 and have definitely gotten my money worth. I thought I would have to convince my friends to get it to have a good time but it turns out the community playing it is awesome. I have yet to find myself trying to find a game and not succeeding. Additionally, it is very easy to host games and people almost always join and play with me!  I've created a few mods which was relatively simple.  My main complaint is that the controls are a little bit difficult to learn and I wish some of the functionality could be mapped to keyboard. However, once you figure it out it becomes second nature and the controls no longer get in the way.  If you're worried about dropping the money to get this and not being able to find people to play with, don't worry, the community is awesome and you will be playing games right away. Additionally, everyone is extremely friendly. However, make sure you have a microphone as it is *almost* required to play most games. There is text chat but very few people use it."
Very fun and addicting game. It is all community based and they give you some board games as well. Watch out for the people who flip the table in rage ;D
Best thing someone can buy on steam.
One of the gems on the store..I do infact prefer board games in physical form but this simulator did help me understand some of the board games that i own in physical format.  10/10
"Simply the best thing on the computer, must-have for anyone whom enjoys tabletop gaming, or enjoys designing their own, on the PC. Period."
Anyone who loves playing board games with their friends needs this simulator in their life.
best bang for your buck on steam hands down.  I bought this game to play D&amp;D with friends long distance and I forget that I'm on a computer playing a game. It works like a charm. Way better than I expected. It is truly like playing it in real life.  If you are a fan of board games or games in general with a nice community and excellent workshop content this is the game for you.   (also there is a google tablet in game that you can set on the table and watch youtube videos with) 
"Simulator games have frequently been a bit of a joke to a lot of people. There's a reason why Goat Simulator is so popular after all, so much so that certain devs are starting to look at the name 'Simulator' with a bit of hesitation. On the surface, a few people might think that Tabletop Simulator is a bit of a joke as well due to some of the things it offers(Flipping the table, zero gravity mode, etc), but what it offers honestly makes it worth the price and shows that it's more than just a silly little thing.   Graphics:  Tabletop Simulator's graphics, as a whole, are simple. They look good enough that they'll get the job done but they won't be winning any awards. The game allows you to import models and textures, so your mileage may vary, as well. The backdrop for the 'rooms' use a 4800x2400 HDRI Panorama shot, which means seams won't be an issue. Overall, passable for what needs to be done.   Gameplay:  Tabletop Simulator is, as the name says, a game used to simulate various tabletops. You start off with a decent number of standard board and card games, most pretty typical for what you'd see. They're nice, but not exactly something I'd pay 20$ for flat out(But I'm a bit stingy), although the ability to play in a system that's not automated is nice.  That leads into my next point: The game isn't automated for the most part. Everything is pretty customizable, and you can do various things, such as set hidden zones, flick items around, throw them around, flip tables, etc etc, with almost, if not all of it being able to be changed for your benefit(Of particular note is that you can disable the Table Flip option, thank god). Leading to a pretty fun experience of just sitting around a table and BS'ing with friends.  My one MAJOR issue with the gameplay is that you cannot peek at a card while it is face down outside of moving it into a hidden zone(Which is a bit cumbersome) or returning it to your hand(Which has its own fair share of complications)   Workshop Support:  This game allows you to create objects, texture them, and use them to make your own various games. The system of doing so is relatively simple, as long as you know your way around models and textures, and it's pretty open, allowing you to import your own models into the game as well. This is where the game shines, as almost any card or board game is possible with what is given to you. The little figure can even be given animations for attacking and the like, to simulate an RPG.  Along with that, there are various tools inserted in the game to help you accomplish this. From counters, to tablets, to MP3 players, to calculators, and more. And ALL of this can be uploaded and downloaded from the Steam Workshop, with download times being reduced due to the ability of Tabletop Simulator streaming image content from a hosted site(Which is both a blessing and a curse, to be honest).  Honestly, all of it is really nice, my only problem with the modular ability of this game is that it seems like you can't plug your own MP3s into the MP3 player and you can't import custom tables, which is a shame, as that would have made RPGs truly perfect for this system. Both of these can be worked around but it leads to an experience that is less than perfect.   Overall:  At the end of the day, Tabletop Simulator is a great game that allows people to just instantly pick up a deck or a pair of dice and play their favorite games. It isn't perfect, and it won't ever be a true replacement for sitting around a table with your friends, but for those who are separated by long distances, this is a great alternative that will be sure to keep everyone happy. It has a few issues but it's constantly being updated and I hope these will be sorted out in time. Something else I want to note is that, while the DLC is a bit heavily priced, only one person needs to own it, which is..pretty much how it goes in real life, so I really appreciate and respect that.  Overall, I'd give this game a 9/10, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone."
Youll make friends. Youll play with friends. Youll be happier and happier the more you dig into this game.
This cheap of a game for essentially an infinite number of games? Yes please!
Awesome mods and so far great community!! Worth the money for sure!
"Very easily allows you to pick up and play games with your friends who also have TTS with great Steam Workshop support. That only one person need an item off the Steam workshop to host for everyone makes it even more approachable. Perhaps still a bit daunting to player larger scale board games with that require you to be constantly changing you view as you try to keep track of everything at once, but the same could be said of playing in person. And unlike playing in person, you needn't have all your friends sitting in once place to play."
"You can download nearly any board or card game in existance from the steam workshop and have a game night with your friends. There are a lot of options and advanced controls to make playing almost as seamless as real life, everything loads quickly, and it's overall really well made."
"Probably the most simple and best games i've played in a long long time. Edit: Almost 1,000 Hours of playtime later, My review still stands."
"It could use a fair bit of polish, to be honest. But OH MY GOD, it is amazing to gather friends from thousands of miles away for a humble card game.  THIS is what the Arpanet was invented for."
"This game has everything a board game enthusiast could possibly dream of! From dominoes through cards games all the way to chess. And when you think the fun ends there:  NOPE! THE STEAM WORKSHOP HITS YOU IN THE FACE!  With an already vast modding scene this game offers, the sky's the limit - Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Cards Against Humanity, Monopoly, Risk,  you name it!    And probably the best thing out of all of these:  You can experience all of it with your friends!   10/10, a must own for board game addicts! "
Did you lose all of your real life friends to board games?  Well guess what ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Give your $15 and (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
"Perfect Game to test out any new board games before you buy and get to play rare older games which are really hard to get your hands on! Also, it adds a nice multiplayer ability for you and your friends who live miles apart but still can enjoy getting together to game!"
An amazing way to play board games.
"Literally the best purchase. If you don't like board games, you should get it. If you do, GET IT."
This is a great game to play with friends. Always have a blast when I play Secret Hitler with my friends.
"Pros Play magic, d&amp;d, 40k tabletop, catan, etc No subscription Easy interface Easy to set up games Board games with friends of long distance  Save games and pickup later Very affordable at 20$, when it goes on sale it's irresponsible not to buy it Moving miniatures Great mod tools Flip the table (and reset if need be)  Cons Player community seems to be 70% good natured tabletop gamers, 30% 14 year old trolls Loading many objects can be rough if you have slow internet    Buy this if you ever enjoyed any board game ever. Don't buy this if you are a potato. "
"THE BEST D&amp;D VIRTUAL TABLETOP THERE IS. It’s cheap, it’s mind-bogglingly varied, you can do anything you can think of, and you’ll keep discovering more and more features you didn’t know existed. This is hands-down one of the best games I have ever purchased. Play any board game or tabletop RPG. Thriving community with infinite miniatures and games. Can also be used to try out games like Agricola, Terra Mystica, Twilight Struggle, and Catan before you buy them. LOVE IT."
Great Simulator! Missing some sort of paper tracking mod or feature for character sheets. You have an index card...but not enough space to keep any additional info. I give it 3.5 stars in its current state for rpgs..but would happily give it 5 if they would add virtual paper.  Update: 3/20/16 - I wanted to also mention as of right now no PDF support (it did at one time). You have to save a pic of a character sheet upload it to imgur. Get the link to the pic. Bring in an additioanl table in game. Paste the image link to the table. This is the only proper way to see a character sheet. The character sheet can not be edited or modified. You will have to bring in a new sheet using a new image with all the above steps.  Update: 3/24/16 As of this date I was able to use PDF's on a tablet. We are moving in the right direction. Now all we need is a sheet of paper (e.g character sheet) for tracking purposes. 4 Stars at the time of this review....Come on 5 stars!
"Had low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised! This game is so good that I've spent well over $100 on it already on buying it for others to enjoy. I truly love this game, and got to the 100 hour mark within my first week. If I had more free time, I'd already be up to 1,000 hours. Can't recommend it enough!  If you decide to buy it, I'd recommend learning Secret Hitler, Eldritch Horror, Arkham Horror, &amp; Sheriff of Nottingham; all fun games! I'd be willing to teach you any of them if you add/PM me, that's how invested I am in this game.  9/10, would be perfect if some bugs were fixed, mainly in matchmaking and ping. The issues are usually resolved by entering/exiting the server, and port forwarding helps a tonne. Expect a lot from this game!"
My friends and I looked at the clock and realized we'd been playing for seven hours straight. That should tell you what you need to know.
Should really be titled 'Game Simulator X'.
"This game was designed for the creative mind to run wild! It is absolutely phenomenal how far you think you can stretch it, and just when you think you've seen the end of the horizon, you discover more you are capable of creating. This has allowed me to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons with my friends from across the United States without having the burden of being in one house. We can play from the comfort of our own homes in Oregon, California, Nevada, etc. Not only that, but the tools this game gives you allows you to create your own game aside from the classics. This is well worth the price!"

I really like this game. The possibilities are endless with the constant flow of mods from the workshop. The community is great and really welcoming. Try it out!
"This game is a must own in my opinion, especially for people with friends who are displaced all over the world like me. You can play anything you want whenever you want and the list of games on it are going to keep growing for a long time to come. Yes, I understand that the game isn't going to be getting any prettier and there is any issue with latency. But this game does something that nothing out in the market can even replicate and I'm willing to put up with its flaws since the sheer amount of things you can do in it are massive.  If you want to read a more detailed review of the game you can find it here:  http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.ae/2016/01/tabletop-simulator.html ."
"Simply unmatched for people who like board and card games. Has all the best games on the workshop (thank you all for the great mods by the way), and has easy to use online and server hosting.  Couldn't be better, it really is just the best, be sure it pick it up if you like board games or D&amp;D, or whatever."
"Great game that lets you recreate any board game you can think of with its wide use of assets and textures. The community is really friendly and many people are there for a good time. Its like walking into a gamestore with casual players and none of the stigma. You might have a troll every once in awhile and there are a few bugs, but with the communities effort and bug fixes this is the game to get of 2016."

"Tabletop Simulator is a hilarious but realistic game which has you trying to create something resembling a game only for someone to come in and flick it all into pieces. There's multiple good things about this game: + Lots of Servers to play on + Singleplayer if you're feeling anti-social + Too much workshop + At least 2000 different games you can create with basic set + Cards against Humanity will probably be on the list of servers + Graphics are nice But also a few cons: - The troll players who come in to destroy your game - Costs more than in the Beta (it cost £11.99 before) - Poker table angles are a bit broken  However, because I got this game in the Beta I got it for £11.99. There's also a setting for blocking access to everything, stopping those naughty trolls. So, overall, this game is one to play if you want tableflipping madne- I, um, mean, fun! 9.4/10"

Buy one board game for $20 or spend $20-60 on every board game you ever buy. Community is pretty good and you don't have to gather in real life to play anything your heart desires. Must have for many people.
"A tabletop physics engine allowing more control for an organized social event than tools for griefers; anyone joining a game can slap the cards out of your hand, but the host can almost instantly ban, and reverse the damage done by rewinding time.   Everything works really intuitively, objects snap and cascade by physically stacking, like chips and cards. Dice rolls with satisfying thuds like 45 grams of the finest plastic four sided cube on 19th century rosewood table. And if you highlight multiple dice, it tallies the total for you.  All game states can be saved and loaded, by any of the 8 players joined, with permissions allowed by the host ofcourse. With integrated voice chat, turn indicators, handzones and private zones for hiding your hand/dice, it brings a lot of games to the table. Also, all types of objects can be customized with its own models, physics, and textures.  The game grants you objects like cards, poker chips, coins, dice (d3, d4, d6, d20, etc.,) and figurines (chess/d&amp;d). Objects snap and cascade by physically stacking, like chips and cards. You can shuffle cards by just pressing R, animation takes less than a second and is heard by all players. Then you can deal to everyone's hand just by clicking a button. Where the host controls the permissions of how every player interacts with the environment with a dropdown checklist. With a maximum of 8 players, it is really multiplayer tabletop games.  Also, there’s a tablet simulator that links to google and youtube, that can be seen by every player on the table. Movie/music night?  The advance features, like tape measurements, allows accuracy POV/LOS action figure games, like Warhammer 40k to be simulated perfectly. All you need is a brain for storing the codex rules, and the figurines available on the mod page. You measure 6” for walking infantry, toss a grenade and borrow the 3” blast marker available on the workshop page. When you shoot, you just lower your camera onto the table, and get an accurate Line of Sight from the space marine’s point of view.  Game's good."
"By far the easiest way to play a D&amp;D game with your friends. Or Chess, or poker, or old favorites from the 90's and even new board games. This game has a little bit of everything, and if you enjoy tabletop you should pick this game up. NOW!"

"One might look at this game and go, 'Pfft, another simulator'. But let me tell you that this game is completely different from the rest. This game provides the best platform to plays thousands of games that you can't play with your IRL friends because they think board games are 'boring and for kids'. The workshop is constantly being updated with more and more games so you'll never go bored. Choosing a server can bit a little hard at times if youre not in the US but it's a small price to pay for a great game. 9/10"

"Out of 10 this game gets a 10 from me for a very simple reason. I have a SO living on the other side of the planet and not once did anything we do make us feel like were really together. But thanks to Tabletop Sim, we felt the closeness of family, and yesterday we had the most fun in ages. I highly reccomend getting this if you have family or close friends abroad. If you love boardgames then the steam workshop has at least 5 games you will love. Don't let the sale pass you by, it's worth it, 100% worth it!"
"This game is a base for tabletop games, don't get this game unless your friends will get it too. I mainly use this game for running my Dungeons and Dragons campaigns which this is pretty well suited to, there is a variety of tilesets and models on the workshop for the casual user and we can actually have a 3d representation of everyone's characters without having to pay 20 bucks or so for actual plastic models. In short, it's a good tool for D&amp;D, card games, Warhammer 40k (pretty much every army has it's models uploaded so no 3000 dollar models for your army) but remember it is a tool not a game."
Want to play awesome boardgames but don't have friends?  Look no further tabletop simulator will be your friend! Just get this game it's brilliantly constructed and the workshop is amazing!
"If you're a game developer, this is a great platform to design/playtest your game and get instant feedback.  If you're a player interested in indie games, this is a great way to discover interesting original content.  If you're a casual player, this is a great game to pop into with some friends and play a quick something.  If you're a hardcore gamer, there's a table flip option.  Absolutely well worth the $20."
"Fantastic! Incredibly easy to mod and make your own board games with a huge selection already available on the workshop, and gives you the perfect feeling of playing a physical board/card game with friends with all the convenience of being digital for cleanup and setup. Also great for things like pen and paper games! Really incredible and worth getting if you have any friends that enjoy playing any kind of board game."

"Played Avalon Hill's Betrayal at House on Haunted Hill (distributed by Wizards of the Coast) with my LP buddies, and had a real blast. The only complexity with this comes from the actual game rules of whatever you decide to play - the simulator itself is simple, easy to use, and very straightforward with its presentation.  The mod community is great, and it's thanks to all their hard work that we have as many games to play as we do!  10/10, will play again.  Anyone who has never played Betrayal at House on Haunted Hill before should really do so, as an aside. It's a wondrous game! As of this review, only the first edition is available from the steam workshop as a tabletop simulator mod, which unfortunately contains misprints and vague rules, and other minor errors. Hopefully modders will whip up the revised Second Edition soon!"
A large selection of board games ensures that it never gets boring.
So this game allows you to simulate a game night with having the need to leave your computer..........which is AWESOME!   I sat here for the first 30 minutes staring and throwing around a bottle of fake ranch dressing. So this game is great.  Pros: - You don't need to leave your room - You can stare at ranch - Simulate board games - Lots of workshop items - Customizable games - Other stuff I forgot  Cons: - You need friends       I had a lot of trouble with that con.
"Well what can I stay? It's a great game in many ways, you can play pretty much any game you can think of. You can watch porn with friends on the tablet.just such wow. 420/10 must buy!"

"Played UNO, Magic: the Gathering, Game of Life, D&amp;D, Monopoly. and Jenga.  BTW, you can play with any Magic cards so have fun playing with $500+ decks with your friends!  Browsed the web with friends  You can use any picture as a Jigsaw Puzzle  Listened to music  Flipped the table  All for $9.99  10/10"
Game within a game award for sure.  Worth every penny
"There's no game like the game that contains unlimited games. If you like tabletop games but hate cleaning up after, this is for you. It's the only time you can socialize with your friends and not having to worry about the consequences of flipping tables and throwing game pieces at each other."
"This is by far the best experience you can get in tabletop gaming without actually being with your friends in the same place. With a whole bunch of mods you can play almost any tabletop game available, even ones out of print, and the best of all for people like me who like to collect (and play) these games, you can use TTS to try out if a particular one will be just for you and save the money if the game wasn't of your taste."

"Totally fantastic. I wish more than anything I had something like this growing up. As an only child growing up with a single parent, there was never really anyone to play board games with. I also never really hung out with anyone who was into board games or table top games despite how much I loved them. Even now, I don't have a lot of local friends outside of my husband who are down to set up a game of DnD or Monopoly and play into the wee hours of the night. This has opened up so many opportunities to play the games I never got to when I was younger, as well as a chance to play the games I had to try to play alone. Thanks so much for this. Now I just have to convince all of my friends both near and far to put this simulator on their computers so we can all hang out and play games when we don't have to time or money to meet up in person!  10/10 PLEASE GET THIS SIMULATOR"
Update: The workshop isnt just good its perfect unless the web hosting for images go down but theres a fix for that. I've started getting well with the community and some people can even help you learn a game which is pretty nice and helpfull.   This game is good hopped on the tutorial and everything was going good until a blast of pieces came over and I had fun with them. The built in IRC chat is nice as it keeps you acconpained throught some things. Workshop content is really good sometimes and the dlc can get really pricey but they are good games the physics the tools all that stuff makes this realistic.  Overall: 100% Its really fun if youre a board games lover person like me. The community is great and nice and i cant stop playing.
great for playing tabletop games with friends however can sometimes have massive framerate issues due to the amount of assets on the table.
Buy Tabletop Simulator if you want to play any board game on the planet.

I've been playing Fate with a group of people all over the world once a week. Guys, you can play games with minis with your friends who moved away. How can you not want that?"

"TTS quickly became my 'go to' game and has remained one of my favorites since back in Beta. The modding communiy has put out some great games and I love that some developers are bringing their official games to this system. As far as boardgames go, this is the system that nearly has it all."
Note *REQUIRES FRIENDS TO PLAY WITH TO HAVE FUN*
"Imagine every single boardgame, cardgame or dice related game you have ever played. With this simulator you get all of them and more! Thanks to the steam workshop, more talented people than you and me have made so many amazing replicas of all the games you loved as a kid. It's insane.   There's multiplayer with random people sure, but playing this with friends and VOIP makes it ten times more enjoyable. The controls are very easy and you get the hang of controlling things like you would with your hands in no time.   Do yourself a favor and buy it!"
"I was gifted this game some time ago by a friend. It's pretty great for playing board games with people. There is a wide variety of board games, and you can make your own games, which is really cool.  Since I liked it, I wanted to gift it to some other friends. Looking at the options, I saw the 4-pack, and thought, 'ooh, that's a good deal.' Except I can't buy the 4-pack, because I already own the game... wut? I want to spend money to buy more copies of this game, but I literally can't. My only option is to pay the 1-game cost, and manually gift it x number of times. That's infuriatingly stupid.   Great game, but hard to share due to stupid store design."

"Problem: You have no friends, but need them to play card and board games. Solution: This simulator.  I cannot recomend this game enough for people who want to have a tabletop night, but can't ever get everyone in the same spot at the same time and have all the games you want. Also, it is kinda like a kickstarter of ideas for any original games you create on it, as the comunity is very polite and helpful. Plus, steam workshop support!  Edit: Will make better eventually, but for now, I'm just getting a badge."

Also, if you like the games on the workshop, consider buying the physical copies to support good, hard work that goes into making these games possible!"

"TableTop Simulator has been a perfect way to play Cosmic Encounter, especially with friends and family who have moved away. Many players have reported that they learned to play Cosmic on TTS and many others are long time Cosmic Encounter board gamers. We are totally excited with the potential that TTS offers for adding all the current Cosmic Encounter expansions: Cosmic Incursion, Cosmic Conflict, Cosmic Alliance, Cosmic Storm and Cosmic Dominion. Another great feature is that playes can create thier own homebrew aliens and custom game tables and add thm to their games!"

"I strongly recommend this game if you have no friends because they hate the types of games you play, and memes you share. If you have no family because they ran away from you (who can really support a 32 year old w/o a job?) to go live out the rest of their pointless lives in the Bahamas - living out the days, one more closer to the evitable black pit of nothing - with the rest of the money that they stole from your own bank account. So, it's alright."

"What a wonderful game. Sort of. I mean, Tabletop Simulator is fantastic, but what makes it super duper fantastic is the workshop games that so many (more talented than me) people are saturating with great games. This is the best ten dollars I've spent since I bought that pair of socks that I like so much. That is how good this is."
"This is probably the best purchase I have made on here by far. I love all kinds of board and card games but very rarely can I get people together to play them off the internet. Now I can get people together at almost any time and enjoy these previously inaccessible games with people from around the world. If you want to play with things like Monopoly with someone hundreds or thousands of miles away, Tabletop is totally worth it!"
"First off, let me start by saying I've been playing Table Top Simulator with it was in Early Access. Now that Table Top Simulator is out of E.A. I felt like I could write my review of the game. Table Top Simulator is a great sandbox! The community and mods are fantastic! I mainly use Table Top Simulator for my D&amp;D group, during our sessions. All I need is Table Top Simulator, my laptop, and a TV. Using all the wonderful mods in Steam Workshop, I can create great 3-D dungeons, towns, and etc for my players. Uploading mods to the Steam Workshop is with ease, in my D&amp;D group we have a player whose been working on models for our D&amp;D games and exciting to see what she develops. Using Table Top Simulator is a great visual for encounters and dungeons, among a long list of other things. We've even used Table Top Simulator for playing our D&amp;D sessions even over the internet, all in the comfort of our own homes. It ran really smooth and there was little to no issues we encountered. The Dev's also release updates quite often and it's exciting what new content they add.   I don't only use it for D&amp;D, though that's what I mainly use it for. Users have been able to upload, in the Steam Workshop, actual board games. Such games as Star Wars: X-WING, Beytral At The House On The Hill, Settlers Of Catan, and etc. It makes playing games with friends easy and still as fun as if you all got together. I would be lying though, if I said it didn't take away the feeling of actually interacting with your friends and seeing their emotions. Although Table Top Simulator has made playing games with friends over the internet easy and fun, it still cannot replace the moments of sitting at your dinning table and playing all together. Given that, I would still recommend Table Top Simulator, 10/10."
look at that... he's winning... flip the table...
Me and some friends from college used to play this all the time and then we found out it is on TTS we purchased this game on the spot since we all live in different cities (and even states) now. If you enjoy card games that can get a little whacky you should definitely check out Munchkin! I can't wait to see what else this awesome game has for us to play! I'd highly recommend this game to anyone that loves tabletop games! Especially if you're like me and you can't always meet up with your friends in person!

"This is truly a game within a game. Thousands of games in fact. Also, who doesn't want to table flip after you lose? Bonus is no cleanup needed after."
I can play that Pokemon Master Trainer board game online and that's cool.
All the board games. All of them. I have bought this game somewhere in the neighborhood of eight times to gift to other people.
"Cool idea, decently implemented.  The sad thing is you can't buy a 'Friend DLC' to enjoy the game :("

"This is a fantastic game, it lets you do whatever you want, play classic board/card games, create new ones, whatever. I have discovered a few games through this that I either have purchased or plan to purchase the actual real life games. so its a great way to find board/card games too. overal this game is pretty solid. it has a great tutorial, its easy to learn and pickup, it gives good admin controlls, there dont seem to be any bugs or lag issues, I recommend freinds to play with you (which should be apparent) because its just not fun to play board games alone. however for those of you without freinds theres an active community of players online that you can just hop in a game with."

"So my friend Kevin and I like to play Uno on this and often times end up screwing around. So this is what happened the last time we played:  -Played one game of Uno, I won. -Kevin flips table. (#inb4kekgamememe) -Begin to play with tablet and ipod music and spawn many game pieces. -Kevin leaves to get food, while I put pony porn on tablet with children's music playing on Ipod, waiting for his return. -Kevin sees this and laughs while being amazed of the fitting music. -Kevin then loads gay porn on tablet. -Kevin then loads some gay foot fetish porn video while I play music. -I weld game pieces together from a distance and throw them off the table, when they spawn, all hell breaks loose. -We cry so hard.  Overall, it is a fun experience, no matter what you do. Plus my friend likes porn too."
Played checkers with myself BEST GAME EVER (but flipped the table when I lost.) 10/10.  
"It's a card game or what we think it is. It's more of a physics sandbox game where you can spawn regular cards or board games and equipment or you can just play by the rules before someone can flip the table out of rage! Including Steam workshop for additional games and fun content to spawn and play.  So basicly, my first time playing this game was with a friend of mine to show me the ropes and random workshop items. Next time I launch the game, I was looking for a Cards Against Humanity server, and I did. Played a couple of rounds and swap games as a group. Next thing you know, tablets and porn. I came back to the server and 2 of my new friends were spawning in tablets and started to looking up porn. How am I suppose to explain that? 'I'm masterbating with my friends?'  But great game, I highly recommend it. Vote 10/10 for Jackie Chan fighting ninjas while handling a homemade come stained Star Trek uniform (CAH)."

"Tabletop Simulator is very much what you and your playgroup make it to be. Some people will play this game for an hour with their friends, get frustrated/bored at Uno, flip the table and seldom if ever return. Others will spend months map-building, learning, and enjoying a large breadth of games-- a unique experience unavailable anywhere else online. With dedication and patience you can make this game into something amazing for your playgroup.    Pros      Extremely customizable    Large modding community    Play any game with anyone    Endless replayability    The only platform of its kind     Cons      Relies on actively accessing various webpages for textures (can break things for users with slow net or country restrictions)    Relatively small playing community (It's hard to just find randoms in a server/forum and join a game)    Memory limitations in the client prevent large amounts of textures to be loaded simulataneously     The physics are not perfect, making some more interactive games frustrating    You will only have as much fun as the combined effort of everyone in your playgroup working to learn and create new content-- at the end of the day it's a social game and you need good friends to play it.     Conclusion    This game will either be an amazing journey for you and your friends or it won't be worth your time installing (which isn't very long at all). In any case, best of luck. "

However, you soon get used to doing even the most complicated tasks quickly, and then this game really sings.There are already thousands of games available in faithful mods, both classic, past, and modern.   If you have even a passing interest in board games and can't manage to get your $20 worth out of this I don't know what to tell you!"

Amazing. A little difficult to navigate at first but once you get a handle on the mechanics it`s just a great way to spend time with your buddies. I`m playing board games I have not seen for twenty odd years. That`s a win in my book. Great idea with the in game tablets. Genius. When your own imagination is the only limitation within an enjoyable program landscape you got yourself a winner. Lets hope no lawsuits are filed in the meantime.

We spent AGES assembling it. It was worth it.  Alas, one of the friends had to depart, but he was swiftly replaced by a respectable gentleman none of us knew. However, this fine chap happened to join in the middle of us assembling a rather... interesting, shrek puzzle.  Turns out this dude was pretty good at creating shrek.

"An excellent game to play board games with your friends.  Sadly my friends and I couldn't play at the same time:-(  Edit Jan. 12 2016  Finally just got a chance to play UNO with my friends, and this could be my best time recently. This game could give the purest tabletop games experience, and the same amount of fun even when they're everywhere.  Also this could be the best developer I've ever met. If you wonder why, just see the comments below.  Also ---- Don't forget to flip the table when a game is over!"
"I know that feel. You found this sweet board/card game that you would love to play with your friends. 'It's gonna be such a blast!', saying in excitement. But we have our friend here name 'Life' that knows how to ruin your fun rather quick. Your friends have confusing schedules, dealing with their family and friends, there's no room for there place to hold this much fun on one table. Well guess what Life, the internet has defeated you once more.  Thanks to the Steam Workshop, there can be countless games that does involve a table but you can stay right where you are. Even if we do have to pay for such mods, it won't be as bad cause this game is going to keep growing with games and updates. And for $15, this is possibly the best thing you can buy and save hundreds on your cash and waste hundreds of of your life hours to something useful!  UPDATE: This game is still recieving updates and it's going in a good way too. If you're a fan of any tabletop games, BUY THIS NOW"

"Dope. Great to play Dungeons and Dragons on, and very flexible. Its like a.. tabletop sandbox in some sense. 8/10."
Best community. Very nice people and are always willing to help. Heaps of workshop items that make almost every table top game possible to play. Even played table top mini golf. Regular people who teach you how to play new games.
Game was pretty good. Memelord friend bought it since it was on sale and currently we cannot play a few minutes of a board game without pieces mysteriously vanishing or the entire deck of cards being glued together. How do I cure memes on the internet?
"With a wide variety of board games brought to you by the game's harmonious relationship between an outstanding community and developers that actually listen, Tabletop Sim is easily one of the hidden gems of Steam's 2016 summer sale.  Aside from just the classics the devs have listed, buying this game has officially given you a swiss army knife that has almost any well-known game you've played on a table with your friends. For those that hate the idea of getting your friends together in person (or just hate people in general), the company this game keeps is relatively small but kind. Occasionally you'll get the tard who excessively flips tables or moves ♥♥♥♥ around, but there are mods in place that frequently saves progress and kick features. There's even a main chat at the starting screen to encourage people to play together. In my first 90 minutes of gameplay, I think it's safe to say that I prefer the company of these strangers. The tablet and mp3 functions also allow for you to listen to stock music that you've heard a million times on top of full google access to a small screen that everyone sees in game. Tie that to the games soothing backgrounds, and you've got one of the most relaxing environments to simulate boardgames in. There's nothing like it.    In short, the game's got two things going for it - a tremendous community of nice people and limitless game diversity. While you don't need it, you should get the DLCs that appeal to you only to show appreciation for the devs. I'd consider this a must-buy."
  pls pls pls improve multiplay connection issues. me and my friends love this game but too laggy
The Cheapest Tablet i ever bought.
"Being the only child at home since I was 4, I had a hard time trying to find someone to play with me on my board games. THis video game has changed everythig I know about playing board games, and allows me to play old and new games with people wanting to have a good time. Pick up a copy today, it could come in handy some day!"
"Best magical table I have ever spent money on!   Sturdy - Can be flipped multiple times and not break once.    Maneuverable - Can take this table anywhere, from a church to underwater.    Adaptable - Can shapeshift it's size to sit up to 10 people around it.  I would recommend this game to anyone who loves board games, Roleplay or just having fun with friends. 10/10 "
"&gt;Be playing 'Secret Hitler' &gt;Waiting for more people to join the game &gt;People start chatting as we wait and some girl talks about how her grandma said her pants were to big &gt;Some dude then says 'And then did you show them a gay porn website?' &gt;*Crickets*  This game can be pretty cringy but is p good, lots of fun."
Half of these games are way too complicated.  I like the menu music though!
"So after getting this game on sale I've managed to get roped into playing D&amp;D with my friends. Needless to say I'm up at 4am preparing my tricks for my first time being a DM. 20/10, would recommend 100%!"
"Excellent way to play board games virtually with friends or new people that aren't close by. Also a great way to test out new games, create, and modify existing."
 Early Access Review
"If you would like to find more board games to play with your friends and family that get you out of the normal kiddie games and into amazing experiences, TTS is a great place to start. You can play a ton of free workshop mods (board games that can be played inside TTS) to discover new games that you might want to buy for your friends and or family.  If you are interested in becoming a game designer, a great place to start is with Tabletop Simulator. Whether you want to design the next FPS or the next Amerithrash classic, the lessons you can learn from board game mechanics and rule sets is invaluable."
Writing a review for this is basically writing a review for every tabletop game ever made. So I am gonna ask you this instead:  Do you like tabletop games? Do you want to play them online? Do you want to play them with real physics and (theoretically) no restricting rules?   Then this is the game for you :D
perfect for trying out new games.
"The power of this game rests in the Steam Workshop.   Fire it up, play DnD, play Warhammer, or hell, play some zombie survival boardgame.   OR  Play Monopoly, play Life, play ♥♥♥♥in' Shoots n' Ladders. Mutha♥♥♥♥in Shoots n' Ladders!  GOD DAMN CANDY LAND!  10/10 Table Simulator"
"I never write reviews. I'm taking out some playing time to write one. This game is amazing. It opens up so many doors. For 20 bucks you get a zillion games and the interface is amazing. Click buy, you won't be sorry you did. Super thumbs up."
"Out of all of the selections available on Steam, Tabletop Simulator is my favorite. If Tabletop simulator went away, I would be severely distraught. Having the option to play the physical games I own in an electronic format is important to me. Sometimes I don't have the time or space to setup a physical game. Sometimes I am on the road for work reasons and isn't practical to cart boardgames with me. I can work on my own games or try variants of existing games with a large monetary investment. Tabletop Simulator is my goto game playing program!"
"I sat around learning the rules to The Settlers of Catan for 2 hours, played it for 8 hours, still don't know how to play it.  I played the Battlestar Galactica boardgame, was a sleeper agent Cylon, formed an epic plot to destroy the humans. It didn't work, and they got to Earth.  I played Betrayal At The House On The Hill, turns out I was actually an infinitely long hydra the entire time, guys. Unfortunately my heads feel seperated when the other guys play with knives and stuff.  I rolled a d20, and it landed on 2. I was blessed by the RNG gods of this game, 10/10."
I have always loved DnD. I enjoy rping with friends when you can be someone other than your self. 
"a game where you can do nothing, with your friends"
"I am, at this moment, writing this review from inside the game. I went over to the 'tools' table, looked down at the tablet in front of me, and browsed my way over to Steam. It was then I realized that I could reach any site on the internet, from within tabletop simulator. After this I'm going to go order dominos so I can continue playing awkward online poker with my friends who I shall never have to interact with outside of Tabletop Simulator again. 10/10 You will never leave"
"I have been able to relive my childhood in playing the Pokemon Master Trainer Board Game, and that's only the beginning. Play whatever, with whomever, and at whatever time. This is a gateway into any tabletop adventure you can imagine."
  Pretty much a GREAT game! Of course it's always better with friends or you can just find online players and make friends. Unless they're pedophiles. Then don't. But anyway they have pretty almost every board game in exinstence in this bad boy. Buy it on sale maybe.
Greatest thing I've ever experienced.
 Early Access Review
Finally tried it out after resisting for a while. Can't recommend it enough to a board game friend. So easy to jump into a table do some gaming!
"Tabletop Simulator! What a great game. It can simulate almost any board game or game that you play on a table. I absolutely LOVE this game and what it's trying to do. It also does what what it does really well, except for a few things. The controls are a little janky at times and also I've had connection problems in the past. However, overall, this is a great game and I highly recommend it to those who enjoy simulation games."
so much fun as long as you can get your friends to play basically every board game ever for one price
"Its like real life, with less physical movement and human interaction!^^"
I can flip tables when im mad 10/10 game
"the perfect game  this is the game we've been waiting for  the revolution has arrived  the perfect 'yeah, let's play a game' game with not playing it included"
This is a MUST BUY FOR VIVE! PERIOD! so cool. The people are frendly and the game plays epicly. ONE GIANT THING WE NEED THOUGH! LET ME TELEPORT THE TABLE OR MAKE IT MORE CLEAR ON HOW THE F TO MOVE IT SO IT STAYINS IN MY PLAY SPACE! PLZ. Other than that 5 ♥♥♥♥ing stars! yes there are stars ♥♥♥♥ing for this game!
Really great way to play fun simple tabletop games with friends over the internet. Highly recommend it.
1000/10 This is the game you want. Whatever game... this has infinite replayability! Online servers for games with other humans! Plenty of options for customizing your playing experience! Sad-face for absence of bots... Does it matter? NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST! This game more than makes up for it!!! Lots of difficult achievements to strive for as well!
"Tabletop Simulator allows me to easily share a hobby of mine with remote, online friends that was previously difficult if not impossible.  It's wonky and imperfect, but it more than makes up for it in flexibility. The amount of mods available is staggering - and you can always create your own. If you have any interest in making a tabletop game, this is an amazing playtesting tool as well."
I explained how to play football right after I had a discussion about sporks and fpoons over a game of mancala that was a distraction from my game of cards against humanity which was a break from my lesbian jigsaw puzzle. 8/8
Chess ✔ Poker ✔ Carcassonne ✔ Secret Hitler ✔ Yu-gi-oh ✔ Risk ✔ Monopoly ✔ Endless workshop ✔ 9/10
Secret Hitler is the best. Love it. Top Bantz.

"This 'game' is basically every board or card game you've ever played. With Steam Workshop you can download and play Monopoly, Sorry, Uno, Pokémon cards, Dungeons and Dragons.. anything really. It's very much worth the money."
"It's like having a table that you and your friends can access from anywhere in the world. Complete with a fairly solid selection of board games and other goodies, an ever-growing selection of board games in the Workshop that are all free of charge, and the ability to import your own cards, dice, boards, or whatever else you have handy.  Trust me, you will easily get your money's worth."

"Buy one videogame, play all the tabletop games ever. Have not tried the DLC games, but there are plenty of others on the Workshop to keep you busy. Plays best with traditional board and card games, may also make for a more immersive experience for TTRPGs."
 Early Access Review
"As of the time I write this review, I've only started to play around with this. I'm a big RPG player, and a big fan of yugioh. Both of these things are available, in spades, on the Steam Workshop. Now, as soon as I can rope some of my friends into getting this game, we will be set for some awesome times XD  Most of the controls are really convenient (WASD panning, solid mouse controls, etc), though I find the menus a bit difficult to navigate at times. This game already has everything you need for a poker night, or any other traditional card game, built in, and has some basics for tabletop RPG's, as well. Although the vanilla RPG resources are a touch scarce, they are plentiful on the Workshop, as intended.  Better than expected physics, and definitely convenient, it has a lot of potential."
Tabletop Simulator was worth every penny I spent on it. There is tons of variety in the workshop and there are virtually endless possibilites.
Really fun
"This game has better metal than most games that claim to be themed around metal.  this game allows me to sit on a tablet and surf the internet, ultimately ignoring my friends as i play 10000/10  such immersion"
"built a robot to destroy my friends, watched helplessly as my king was assassinated, was secretly Hitler (and a werewolf), fought hordes of orcs, wiped out earths population with a deadly virus and sold a bag of rocks to a musician, all from the convenience of my basement, without the need for actual friends"
very good game to play whit friends
"I'm honestly not sure if I can recommend this game as the real fun mostly comes from the Mods - and more importantly - the (original) board version of the mod. You wouldn't rate a game sequel 10/10 if they did just the same thing again without any innovation.  HOWEVER, Tabletop Simulator does a fantastic job allowing players to use their own game and offers a great opportunity to play board games with friends far away or even complete strangers. I don't play board games with the friends living close to me, so it's a great that I can simply join a online lobby and get a 8 player game starting in minutes!  Playing more uncommon (but soooo good!) games like 'Cards against Humanity' or 'Secret Hitler' is a lot of fun, which wouldn't be possible (for me) without Tabletop Simulator. If you are in a similar situation as me, I can recommend getting TTS - but please do mind that a lot of fun is coming from the original creators of their respective board games and they should enjoy your support the same way!"
"Like board games? You'll save a ton of money by investing in this game and getting to try out all the board games youd like to purchase before you actually go out and purchase them. Modern games are getting really expensive, most big ones sitting around 100$+, getting to try them all for free here is definitely worth it."
9/10 Not Enough BoredGames. -IGN
"You know how that board game you've always wanted to play - but limited due to how small your house is? Well, alas; Tabletop Simulator is for you! "
"This game makes Game Night so much easier!   I have a group of friends that tries to get together regularly to play games. We can't always make it happen, because life and all that.  We all picked up this game, and suddenly Game Night happens much more often! It's so nice to be able to hop online and get into whatever board game suits your fancy.  The tools for making your own games are also pretty robust, which I appreciate as a designer. Even if you aren't playing games with a group, it's still an excellent way to quickly prototype and test game ideas."
Two words: Secret Hitler...
Just awsome... having your friends playing boardgames without even leaving the house !!!
10/10
 Early Access Review
GET THIS GAME@!!!!!!
"Actually a simulator, as opposed to a cash-grab with simulator slapped on it's name."
When you and your friends don't want to meet up and play board games or you have no friends then this game is for any card game or board game lover. This game has a lot of fun and different games that you can play. 10/10
"One of the favourite games in my library. It is very easy to learn the controls and jump into an open lobby, but unfortunately there is basically no variety in public games. After about 2 months you will either have to play the same games you've played multiple times before, or host your own game (but be prepared to teach the newcomers).    While public games are fine, the true enjoyment of TTS comes from private matches. If you can convince your friends to get the game as well, you will have much more fun playing with them instead of strangers. Private matches &gt; Public matches."
Tabletop Simulator + Friends = Epic Stories
Excelent Platform for those who love Boardgames. You'll need friends who also have this game for a full and perfect experience. Very good official DLC's and a lots of MODS (some better than others). Also you can flip the table when you rage withouth the consequences of doing it in real Life. 11/10
"Seems great. Now all I have to do is learn how to play: chess, blackjack, and all the rest of the board games."
 Early Access Review
10/10
"10/10 game, I feel bad for ignoring it at first. Pirating boardgames is a lot better than it sounds.  Some people made some cool games that no one ever talks about because they're too busy not having fun with Monopoly. Also because they cost 60 quid."
 Early Access Review
"Lots of fun, great simulator to play all kinds of games on! Fun for everyone, really easy to use and a great source of fun goodness not requiring lots of resources to do so"
Worth the 20$.
"This is a must have in everybodies library for the fact alone that you can just about play any bored game you have ever known and loved on it, im a big family person and playing games like monoply and blackjack was always so wonderful for me to enjoy with my sisters and parents, i have friends from other countries and playing those games again with them and making new memories is wondeful. my family is usually too busy to play stuff like that any more but when we are apart and have free time this game is a wonderful way to laugh with them once more, thank you to the creators for brigning back bored games in a cool PC way &lt;3"
This game was something I didn't expect to enjoy as much as I have. The workshop community has made this game amazing. You can find almost any card and board game created by the community. This game is well worth the price tag.
"When heathens threaten you, play a civilized game of chess. then when they aren't expecting anything rip their flesh off and make a new coat!"
Best game to play board games with people from all around the world!   Tons of free game on the workshopt and high quality DLCs.  Also the VR feature is great!
"Unlimited possibilities, and it ain't lying. The only limit is your imagination.  There is an absolute minimum amount of hand holding. If you play Battleship, you will have to vocally call out the attack, and respond with hit or miss. You have to drag the little piece to the board to fill out the grid yourself. If you play poker, you actually have to deal the cards and count the chips. In Jumanji, you're responsible for releasing your own wild animals (0/10). That's really my only gripe, some workshop maps offer some scripting, but I'd like to see a bit more hand holding (like an auto dealer for hold'em, a chip counter for gambling, persistent servers, some self moving pieces).   You can cheat, you can flip the table, you can rage flick your buddies piece, and you can even play board games. Highly recommended."
"A large variety of game modes, a fairly amicable community, brilliant presentation, and countless mods (with more being produced as I type this) available? This is definitely one of the best ways to play board games with friends over the internet!"
An absolute must-have of the sale. Best played with your friends.
"Excellent simulation of a tabletop environment. The DLC is very reasonable in price and the resources available in the Workshop or elsewhere give you almost unlimited applications. I've played a few different games and spent a fair number of hours building tables for Battletech. I'm very impressed with its capabilities.   Take care, on tables that have a HIGH number of high poly models it can hit your FPS....and cause lag to remote players."
Joined a russian jigsaw puzzle server Made a zootopia puzzle drew wieners 9/10 would do again.
very fun with many different game modes
ten out of ten would get all the workshop mods again 
I just spent 4 hours of my life laughing my ♥♥♥ off with highschool friends who live 1500 miles away. Tabletop Simulator is the best money I've spent on steam. I bought the 4-pack. The workshop content is enough to keep any group busy for years.
"Having alot of fun with this one, Countless board games both classic and new, It's a damn good time, especially with friends."
"Fun game to play with a group of friends. The workshop has some really cool games for Tabletop and am always finding cool new board games that i didnt know were real. It is a great way to bond with friends over a large distance and has awesome features such as fliping the table, which is entertaing to say the least."
"♥♥♥♥ing beautiful, but you need a good group of friends."
"Fun Game. At home and wanna play those card/tabletop/board games ya play at the cafe or with friends? This is the game to do it in. Also got a game you seen, make it in the workshop and upload it to try in the game."
Actually simulates some good f*cking tables.  11/10 Would flip the table to scare my friends again.
"finally finished a game without any issues! played boss monster 2! fun! but the real thing is better.  lag is mostly on our ISP side.  all in all, this game rocks! if you love tabletop games! this is definitely worth it!!! you can do LAN party to maximize the fun, well you cant play offline... but have your friends on the same room for easy communication and contagious laughter  8/10"
"I haven't placed a review on this yet, but table top simulator is a must buy for any tabletop game fan. It's simple to use once you learn the controls, and can play many games from the workshop, and even create your own.  But this is also a must play for HTC Vive users as well as it now has roomscale and motion tracking support and i have had nothing but joy playing it on the vive.  So much so I fell trying to flip the table earlier.|  10/10 will almost break vive again"
My original review was negative as there was no way for me to connect to servers and i couldnt port foward on my router. Now that those issues have been resolved its so easy to connect to friends and play! Very much recommend this game!! Great fun and super happy with the devs community involvement! 10/10
Garry's Mod: Tabletop Edition
"If you have friends who are lazy or live too far away, this is perfect for you all. The price is high, but if you plan on using it for more than one or two things, I would highly recommend it."
"TTS is without a doubt, one of the best games available on Steam. Priced at 19.99 it is easily one of the best investments anyone can make. With the wide array of games available on the Steam Workshop, the huge amounts of players and the overall friendly community TTS offers hours upon hours of gameplay. I highly recommend checking it out."
Awesome game!   69/10 Would flip table again
This is by far the best community i have ever seen :). Really love this game. Dont be afraid if you dont know how to play any games.
 Early Access Review
"Aw men, this game is just... PERFECT! You can do whatever you want and it's super cool to play with your friends! I recommand it! If you have the time and the money, just buy it, it's fun!"
"Very great platform to play any board games with your friends. As long as you have people to play with, I see no reason to not get this game. The controls can be awkward, sometimes a bit underwhelming. But in the end, you are able to play near endless boardgames with your friends, only needing one game. Highly enjoyable. Also you can use this game for your Pen&amp;Paper needs, as you can create Dungeons and whatsoever with relative ease. The workshop is huge and has almost everything."
great game! worth the 20 bucks for sure. Literally endless amounts of fun. Infininte board games 
"The best part is when you spend 30 min browsing the workshop looking for the perfect games for you and your friendos to play. only to have your friendos not want to play anything because they either don't want to learn the games, or they just ♥♥♥♥ around to much doing the setup and dont want to play it anymore. i wish i had better friends"
"  In all honesty I'm just writing this review to earn badges, but while I'm at it I might as well write a little something about TTS, no?  If you're unsure whether or not you should buy this I can tell you a few reasons you'd want to check to make sure it's worth it for you.  1. Do your friends own it and you enjoy playing tabletop games? 2. Do you enjoy playing around with physics? 3. Do you want/need some sort of software to try out a game before you buy it in real life? (Yeah yeah, not all games exist for this yet, but there's a lot of them and more are constantly added.) 4. Want the satisfaction of flipping the table after you lose? (Granted, you're going to need the host's permission to do this, but you know.)  If at least 2 of those get checked by you, I say buy it. It's not the best way to play tabletop games, but it is a really good substitute, even more so if the people you want to play with are in other countries. Like any software/game you'll find yourself annoyed at certain things, but in my experience with TTS, these things are so minor that you'll overlook them immediately. A few things that I've found myself getting a little annoyed over include physics not always working as they should because of a workshop item not being completely refined and certain scanned items not being readable. All annoyances are either small enough to just ignore or easily worked around.  It's easy to recommend this to anyone who's looking to play some tabletop games with friends in other countries or just wants to try out a few games before going to pick them up in real life."
Most amazing game to hit the PC since Oregon Trail
"Great game. So many endless possibilities and options for games. This simulator is literally what you make it. If you dont enjoy using TableTop Simulator, you're doing it wrong."
  I like the part when we spawn in player made board gmes but have no idea what to do because there's no instructions
"The game provides you a endless playground within the confines of a table, one that can be used to play almost any game. Made even better by the presence of a vibrant and diverse modding community allows for even more possibilities from beloved classics to quirky games you try on a whim.  If you play board games, or anything that involves a tables, dice or cards, you can play it here. Can you put a score on that?  Yes: 10/10."
"This game... is insane. Not only can you play a bunch of board/card games with your friends or randoms without the physical game, but also can listen to music via tablet and/or ipod, stream videos, search for... things, and etc.   It's so good that I rate this googol/10 (1x10^100 by the way)."
"2 hours in and this could possibly be the best thing I have ever bought. I have a friend out of state that I haven't been able to play board games with... until now!  Even without a friend, there are a ton of open games to join with a really good community.  Checking out the Steam Workshop for this game is a MUST.   10/10"
This sandbox is amazing for board gamers. I have tried many digital Tabletop game simulators and this one blows all others out of the water.
"The wonderful thing about Tabletop Simulator isn't it's depth or it's innovation, but it's ability to take a classically local scenario and expand it on a global scale. I love board games, but I often find them painstakingly long to set up and even harder to find people to play with sometimes. But with TTS, I can message my friends and within minutes have a game set up and running. The connection has always been terrific, the base content is solid, and the seamless ability to bring in new content through the Steam Workshop ensures that TTS will have a place in my library for a long, long time. TTS is one of the best social interactions I've had on Steam in a long while, and as more and more people add it to their collections, I can only imagine that will continue to improve."
"Twenty dollars USD to have access to pretty much everything tabletop you could ever want to play, and even games that are not out yet on the market. IT's good to play with friends at home even if they aren't in the same room with you, or you could learn new games in public games.   I recommend this to anyone who likes tabletop games of any kind."
"Tabletop simulator is one of the most fun and versatile games out there right now, with extensible tools and work shop support, literally any tabletop game can be recreated in it to be played with people all across the globe.  With the addition of Vive support the game became 100X more valuable, now I can really sit down at a table with some people and play. It's the most fun game for anyone weather you are a hardcore tabletop master or someone who has only played Uno or Solitare."
 Early Access Review
Great for playing RPGs They fixed alot of the old problems.  I do however recommend having a group of friends as some online groups can be hit or miss. Group of friends no longer able to play board games together due to distance? this is your Asnwer!
"Very, very great and rather fun game. There's an extremely large variety of games/board games to play from the steam workshop, the global chat is usually pretty friendly and there's usually people asking if others want to play a game. As well, if you don't have anyone to play with, finding a game to join by talking to people in the global chat or joining an outside community (like The Red Dice) is pretty easy.  Definitely worth getting. The only small bit of frustrating or baffling thing could be learning how to actually play some games because if you're just reading the manual or rules by yourself, it can be a bit confusing how the game works. Nonetheless, that's how it is with real new board games, so that's not a valid complaint. And anyways, it's very simple to either watch videos of people playing the game on Youtube or so, or even just joining a lobby and telling them you've never played before. People are usually pretty good about explaining how to play, and when you do this, you at least know that you're definitely playing the game right.  Again, would totally, totally recommend. So fun and entertaining."
its fun if you have friends that you can play whit
  Tons of fun and you can play any board game imaginable!
The best way to play board games I don't own. 
my friend flipped the table...  I flipped his dog
"  I spent more time playing in a room where its just a banana on a table than actually playing tabletop games, that says a lot about the games you make and how arbitrary things you put it in are very important, would recommend the Guess Who? Pepe Edition"
Good for general purpose tabletop gaming with friends online. It's a really fun game with unlimited potential for custom content.
This game is so fkin Awesome because you can play every single card and tabletop game there. also - Secret -Hit.Ler-
I choose not to flip the table because I'm not as STRONK as my nazi friend
Because flipping tables into the void has never been so fun
Probably the coolest thing I've seen on Steam!  It's basically a physics-based toychest that is amazingly easy to interact with and customize.  AND IT'S TEN BUCKS RIGHT NOW! (as of 2/10/2016)
"I saw a bunch of youtubers play this game and I decided to buy it during the steam summer sale at 50% off, and to be honest it was worth every penny.  Pros: Tons of modding and scripting You can play board games for free using mods Community is mostly friendly so it's easy to play games with random people Good Community There is Global Chat so you can connect and find games Most of the Community is Adults  Cons: To have the best experience you need a group of friends Super Small Community You are playing with random people   Nuetral: If you want to play with randoms you probably will have to teach the game you are playing There are trolls and griefers, but that's with every sandbox game so get used to it   Overall I give this game a 7.999/8"
"Cool application, more of a tool than a game, to simulate playing tabletop games with friends. You can tell that it started as a non-serious attempt of a game (just simulate playing chess and checkers on a virtual table with gravity and physics and be able to flip the table, ha-ha), but as it became more and more popular, the developers started shaping it up into a really feature-complete program. Now the game includes almost everything you need (besides friends) to enjoy boardgames, role-playing, or just simulate sitting on a table with another person watching youtube videos and hanging around.  I recommend it because it is the best at what it does, and fills a niche that was vacant for a long time. The developers are also very active and keep on adding features and fixing bugs. However I would point out some negatives: -The game has a form of DRM, even though the kickstarter campaign promised it to be DRM-free. Personally I would like to have a tool like this available forever to play with my friends, instead of depending on developer-run servers. -Since it is in constant evolution, updates to the game sometimes break or remove previous features that worked OK. The developers have stated that they do not plan to support older versions, and in fact do not offer them for download. -The game is advertised as cross-platform, but mac and linux versions have lower priority for bug fixing, from what I've seen.  Even with these negatives, there are no alternatives to this game with the same functionality, so get it if you need it. I didn't mention VR because I don't own the hardware, but that is another point in favor of this game for some of you.  "
"  At first I was like.. 'Who would want to play board games on simluator?'  This game runs super smooth and is tons of fun with friends.   You can play The Game Of Life, Chess, Chinese Checkers or any other board game you can think of.  I reccomend this but only if you have 1 or more friends to play it with."

"Fun game, bought it for $9.99 during the summer sale TOTALLY worth it! The community is pretty nice and leanant on you for being new! :D"
"It's time we forget about all the 'monopoly online 2015 free' games on our tablets and phones. Here comes the Tabletop Simulator, the ultimate tool for having fun. You've always wanted to play some board games with someone you don't see really often? TTS will help. TTS provides the best experience out there, it doesn't 'hold your hand' - rules are enforced by players, not the game itself. As a master (if the game needs one), you can always do some miscalculations - just like the real board game. No automatic stuff (unless it's scripted, it's possible, but not necessary). The game feels great. I've been waiting for a game like this for a couple of years, and finally it's here. Final score: 10/10."
"There is nothing more fun then playing risk on pc with 2 other friends for 4 hours straight, then flipping the table and never finishing the match. 10/10 can't wait to use this to play 40k tabletop."
"The whole premise is being able to play any board game ever made, and ever WILL BE made, but sometimes the freedom can be a downside. Since everyone has the same abilities of control as anyone is real life, you have to rely on them cooperating."
"Have you ever wanted to play those card games from your youth such as Uno and the pokers without leaving the comfort of your computer? Of course not, you're twelve and don't know what an Uno is. But, for those of you who aren't twelve and know what an Uno is, this game is probably for you.    Want to play Uno with cards that have Nicolas Cage's face on them? You got it.    Eels and Escalators? Sure!    A digital version of Space Hulk that isn't completely disappointing? Well, I'm not really a pen-and-paper kinda guy but who knows?    Games and gaming objects for any occasion and necessity are available to you, the tabletop-but-not-on-an-actual-tabletop gaming public.   'But, Mr. Speedchunk. I don't see the game I want/I have this idea for a game, what do?'  Firstly, you don't start a sentence with 'but'. Secondly, if you don't see something you like, you can make it yourself. The customization is flexible enough to be part of Cirque Du Soleil probably.  You can even flip the table if you feel the rage overcome you.   So if you have friends and want to simulate some tables, go ahead and play this game."

"Absolutely excellent game, it's wonderful to play a game of poker with your friends online and just relax. Very fun and relaxing"
A game that is designed to be enjoyed in a group. If you don't have one to play with then this would most likely be a bad investment but if you can get a few friends to considering buying it also it is such an amazing experience. Great fun to be had and an awesome way to test board games/card games/etc. before you buy them if you are interested in seeing how they play and such.   Pros:  Hilarious fun Large amount of selection on the workshop Good for testing games  easy to use and learn interface    Cons: If you don't have friends it would suck.
One of the greatest purchases you will ever make.
"You can play so many games on this from Uno, to Monopoly, to Cards Against Humanity, to even Solitare it's overall just REALLY fun. Lots of variety."

"Probably the most versatile game on steam. Literally thousands of games you can play all professional quality. From the biggest names like Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride and Magic the Gathering with all of its tens of thousands of cards to games you've never heard of. 9.5/10.   I only take a half off because the user to user interface and ability to find games is severely low tech. A lobby connected to IRC? What is this, the 90s? Nice for global chat but very poor at connecting you to other players for games."

Best VR experience.  Also way cheaper than buying every board game seperately.
"Really enjoying this. The game itself lacks a lot of support in the form of help files or much of a tutorial so it can feel pretty opaque to begin with. The resources are out there on youtube or here to learn more, however so search a bit wider and it will all make sense.  Lot's of questions at the moment but I still feel that if you're interested in game creation this is worth the price."
"This game is fantastic if you like board or card games. It will take a little get the the hang of what's going on, but well worth the $20 it goes for at full price. It's so good I bought a copy for my brother just so we can play card games together."
"Tabletop Simulator is a game about playing board games. It comes with about 8 standard board games (chess, checkers, etc.), but the workshop support is what extends its value."

"100/10 IGN  The first thing I would like to say is that I have over one thousand hours on this game. Each, and every single hour was played. Not a single time did I start the game and just leave it on. That is a small way to sum up how much I truly adore this game.   If you dislike tabletop games, then this is not for you. Do not buy this game just to flip tables or dismantle other people's games, because theres an easy banning system which can stop people within seconds. You're not even permenantly disrupting the game, because of the rewind feature.   If you actually enjoy tabletop games, whether it's Cards Against Humanity, RPG's, or King of New York, then this is for you. It takes a bit to get used to all the controls, but after your first hour or so you'll have everything down if you went through the tutorial. This game is limitless in it's possabilities. I could litterally play almost any game, even if it's not actually a board game. Someone made a 100% Orange Juice replica in this, which is a great video game.   The overall community is great, and eventually you will make friends from this game whether you like it or not. You'll come across people who enjoy the same games as you, and that's something I've yet to experience from any other game. Something that can sit me down and allow me to find someone with similar interests."
"This is so awesome. You can play just about any game ever made and if it doesn't exist in the game or in the workshop you can make, save and upload any game you want. Creating games can be easy or difficult depending on what you are making. Creating custom game pieces, boards and tables is easy but when you get into making your own 3D models that gets on the tricky side if you don't know how to do 3D rendering, which I don't. This is too much fun, you have to buy this if you like tabletop games of any kind."
"Fantastic game and great price!  For how much this game has to offer, they could easily charge double this price for it and still be giving people a good deal. It might also help to curb some of the trolls, though thats obviously invariable in all multiplayer games on some level."
"Clearly inspired by Wolfire Games' Desperate Gods, Tabletop Simulator is by far my favorite game in the Steam library. While I may not have many hours, when I do play, there's always so much fun to be had! Tabletop Simulator is a physics engine that gives you a few starting props, and says 'have a go.' It's up to the players to decide what games they build and play.  You can import your own 3D assets into the game, for tokens or other game pieces, and if you're not a great artist, try using some pictures (that you have the rights to, hopefully) of your favorite card games to build a game deck and play that instead!  With Steam Workshop support, some of your favorite games are already available to download and play! Cards Against Humanity, for instance, is a game licensed under Creative Commons, allowing the game to be hosted in many forms on the Workshop, and many players have even made their own cards for use in the game!  Give it a buy, and you won't be sorry! Just make sure to grab the four-pack, so you can play with your friends! Guaranteed to cause one of you to kill the other eventually."
A blast to play with friends :)
"A very open game, which is aweomse and allows creators to make some amazing things. I always am able to relax in this game, and I don't say that about alot of games. Super nice community and awesome to just log on and play some game that doesn't really matter."
I have never been more addicted to flipping tables constantly and drawing ♥♥♥♥♥ in Pictionary in my entire life.   10/10 Would play tabletop games and flip table again.
"Cheap little game where you can play lots of board and card games that are included in the game. The workshop integration is great, I'm a fan of the Cards Against Humanity addons."
Very fun and customizable game. Workshop content is fantastic.
"This is a wonderful game that is extremely simple, but at the same time, really fun!! You get to play board games that you might not even have with people online! If your friends can't come over and hang out, you can just get this game and play with your friends. I recommend this game to everyone who likes board games....which is pretty much 1/4 of the world, but there is an awesome option that will hopefully turn that around. If you want to or if you want to get rid of your rage, just click the flip the table button to throw your table into a abyss. Really fun game and love playing with my family and friends."
"Coming off the back of a long game of Battlestar Galactica, and trying to mod my own game into the system, if you are into board games or card games you can get some awesome times with this. The tech support from the devs is timely and on point, the game interface works (though because of what it does it is a bit clunky, even with scripting), and the community is generally friendly. Yes, it's mostly secret hitler if you look for games, but there's usually at least something else going, or playing with friends works most of the time (there are a few bugs probably courtesy of the overburdened interface).  Still reecommended, this is the only software on steam I have purchased at full price, and have no regrets about that (though the sales are plentiful, I was just between them when I got it)."
"Tabletop Simulator (TTS) is exactly what it sounds like. It is a program that allows you to play pretty much any 'analogue' game that you can think of, on the computer. While it will never replace the tactile feel that you get from holding actual game pieces or cards, nor the joy of sitting at a table with a bunch of other people who enjoy the game you are playing, it has so many benefits that any fan of any table top game needs to own this.  First, you can theoretically play literally any tabletop game that exists in real life, on TTS. The mod community has shown a lot of hard work and creativity when it comes to available games on this. Aside from the standard games like Chess that already come with this game, you can play popular board games like the very popular, but much maligned Monopoly, to board game fan classic Battlestar Galactica. Even miniature games like Warhammer and Guild Ball are available to play. Want to play a LCG like Netrunner or Doomtown, but don’t want to shell out the hundreds of dollar’s worth of card expansions? It’s here too. If you have an idea for your own game, you can make it here too.   The best part however, is it allows you to play these games at any time, even if your friends live far away, or if none of them are available. There is a community out there who wants to play these games. If you like table top games at all, and wish you could play them more often: get this game. 9/10 “Excellent” "
Awesome game! It's the Garry's Mod of boardgames.
Great game for playing a ton of different tabletop games
"ENG: I found this game very fun if played with friends, having predefined or create games based on the desire of the moment is very good , then the fact of ditching the table during the most critical of their game is up ahahhaha  ITA: Ho trovato questo gioco molto divertente se giocato con amici, il fatto di avere giochi predefiniti o da creare in base alla voglia del momento è molto bello, poi il fatto di buttare all'aria il tavolo nel momento più critico della propria partita è il massimo ahahhaha "

"I've had this game since the Kickstarter, and played it a lot before it came out on Steam, but now that they added VR support I decided to try it out.  It's an amazing experience! Last night, I played Cards Against Humanity in an abandoned warehouse, and in between games I shrunk down to a couple inches tall and used a 20-sided die to play catch with another VR player, while the other players watched two tiny guys throw a die back and forth. Amazing."

"I've played this game for 72 Hours. It's a fun and nice game to play with friends.   The Negative part about it is sometimes when you have too much mods for the workshop in tabletop simulator the loading times can be pretty slow but, I've had some problems with the server too although, those were just one or two times.   Besides that it's one of the best games you can get within steam. If you're a fan of board games than I recommand you give it a try.   :)"
"Name me any board game. It can be any physical board game in the world. It'll still be playable on Tabletop Simulator.  Oh, it isn't in the workshop? Well, let's mod it in then."
An excellent platform to play tabletop games with your friends.
Not really as much of a game in of itself as more of a virtual medium for you to play actual board games with people you otherwise would have either very little or no chance to play with in reality. Lots of options and updates to said options to assist in playing a board game correctly as if you were actually sitting in a room with other people. Definitely get this if you are a fan of playing board games and don't have the ability to play with certain friends. 10 out of 10.

"I was extremely skeptical when I saw this game. It looked clunky and weird and it was hard to visualize actually utilizing it for anything. Now that I have given it a go, I am nothing but impressed with this. TTS allows avid board game players to play in a REALLY convenient way. You just load up whatever board game you want to play (and there are TONS of mods for pretty much any board game, like how can this even be legal?!), invite your friends to the game, and go. You can even save games and come back to them later, which is super useful for extremely long and involved games. If you are into board games, I can't recommend this game enough."
Great game to play with friends! Some bugs here and there like when your joining your friends and you type in the password it will say connection failed yet it still connects you to the game. Otherwise ive had no problems. And i love flipping the table!! :D
I picked up this game in the summer sale for 10 bucks but after playing only 2 hours of it I knew this game was worth the full 20 dollar price tag. It just throws you in a sandbox in which you can play whatever board game you desire. The community for this game is one of the best I know of; they are happy to teach you a game if you don't know how to play all the while the creative people come make more games to play.   I LOVE it 10/10 would flip the table again.

"This simulator is amazing. You can play with your friends almost everything by just downloading the content on Steam Workshop. But the rules you need to make it, there aren't any default rules for a game.  (For example you can move your opponent's card etc.) Basically it's free to move, you make rules, you choose the game, you play. Oh, and you can flip the table, just in case.   "

"Takes a little bit of practice to get the hang of, but once you do it becomes nearly second nature. Just about every action can be done on the mouse, so it isn't neccessary to learn a huge amount of buttons on the keyboard.   Great selection of workshop games, but don't take my word for it! I've found just about every game that I've been wanting to play on the workshop.   Haven't looked into the editor yet, though i've heard good things.   Overall, I suggest this game to anyone who is looking to get into board games, as it is the cheapest option out there and lets you test hundreds of games before you put down real money to play them (Nothing beats playing the real game!). Fantastic if you have friends who aren't nearby you want to play board games with too. If you don't have friends who have this game, and don't want to pay for a pack, there are still public multiplayer matches that you can join to play with other people."

Way more fun than I expected it to be. The stupid jigsaw puzzle alone has caused so much mayhem. I don't even like tabletop games!  Downsides are: Americans screaming about politics in every game.

"$20.00 for a PC game that will let me play ANY board game, card game, ETC with any of my Steam friends? Well, now I never have to buy a physical board game again."
"A physics sandbox simulating a table for the purpose of all manner of tabletop games - Board Games, Card Games, Pen-and-Paper RPGs, Jigsaw Puzzles, etc. With an extensive Workshop selection of user-made content many popular childhood games can be found. I've used it to host table-top RPGs and card games and even just sitting around BSing with friends is enjoyable. With some playful props thrown in and everyone chatting, It definately feels as close to sitting around a table as it can get without engaging webcams.   There'sd no AI so rules are not artifically enforced, if a player wants to cheat by moving out of turn or swapping the places of a Knight and a Rook - just like in real life - there's nothing stopping them but honest. However, there are physics mechanics in play to keep objects from slopping around the board. Pieces can be hard- and soft-locked in place so accidental nudging doesn't ruin a carefully laid board and pieces can optionally snap to a grid. - Just enough framework to allow things to work well and avoid chaos without being restrictive and 'too much like a videogame'.  I highly recommend TTS to anyone who enjoys any manner of tabletop games. I was skeptical but saw that the game had potential and am very pleased to say that it's lived up to my expectations and surpassed them."

The legalities of the workshop content may be questionable, but if anything they have allowed me to play a game I have never seen before with others, then go out and buy the physical copy to share with my friends. Please don't ever change and please, if your game is in the workshop, it's a FREAKING AMAZING PLACE TO BE! I'm still excited over this game after so much time and glad it seems to be well supported by community and developers alike.  If you like boardgames or anything tabletop, get this NOW!"

"although theres only a few games that dont work as they should like RC racing around the table, this game is great for people with friends across the country and being drunk while playing this only makes it better which is what me and my friends do due to the fact that the controls are made to seem like youre actually picking up monopoly pieces, so if youre playing chess, you have to pickup individual pieces as if youre there. This game even has board games you probably never even heard of and introduces you to some surprisingly fun board games and with the access of steam workshop the library of games is endless. It might take some practice to get use to the controls but once you play a few games youll get the hang of it. 10/10 for a simulator game"

"A must-have for every board game enthusiast. You can play with friends that are far away - or join a completely random party game with some strangers (Secret Hitler is just great, look for servers!). You can learn rules for your new games in a single player mode before getting them on a table. You can try out something from your BoardGameGeek wishlist before buying it, there are tons of awesome games in the Workshop (Star Wars Series, Tragedy Looper, Betrayal at House on the Hill, Lewis &amp; Clark, Android Netrunner - these are just some of my favorites). You can make your own epic DnD campaigns. You can flip the table in a fit of rage and watch millions of pieces falling into the abyss. The possibilities are infinite!"
Great for when you just want to hang out with friends and flip quarters.
Now I never have to go outside again.
It's a pretty fun games to play with friends and it never gets boring because you have so many games to choose from!
"Board games, DnD, and everything you can think of with your online buds, what else can you ask for."
Couldn't finish my Trump jigsaw puzzle. 9/11
  Well done enough. Nothing beats playing the real thing. But this has almost everything. Lots of great games here.
Flip table immediately
"I played Jumanji, Fluxx, and Guess Who with other people one day, a lot of original single-player games another, and work on solving jigsaw puzzles the first. That's just the tip of the iceberg. There's old board games from the 1990s (and prior) that I rarely see in real life. There's custom tarot decks, there's board games based off of video games, and more. Get it. On sale or at full price, it's completely worth it. Best choice I made in a while. Only downside is that the controls take a bit to get used to."
Best table top simulator period. Keeps getting better with time.
"Okay. This game is awesome. Although I must admit at first the full set of controls are hard to master, it is completely worth it. This game also doesn't start out with too many games, and the workshop is 80% people who doing terrible at copying people who actually put effort in to their games. This game is great to play with friends (you get lonely playing by yourself sometimes) and includes the all important feature of... flipping the table!  8/10, I still continue flipping the table after it is already falling in to the abyss."
It's great with friends!
A game with lots of games in it
"Near limitless games to choose from in the workshop, and once you learn the controls it allows a lot of control for tabletop games and RPGs."
The platform is simply amazing. With a little work (even from someone else) games both classic and new can be brought to life and played over amazing distances. No more waiting until holidays to play risk with your family or betrayal with former coworkers.
Hilarious and fun to play with friends. Unless it's Monopoly.
"This truly is a great 'game'. If you liked playing board games with your friends as a kid but can't now because everyone lives far away and has a job and kids, then this is the game for all of you. Sit down and play some Catan or Munchkin or D&amp;D probably, you can bet someone made a mod for it. Game within a game category shoe-in"
"So I can simulate my tabletop games, I can simulate myself being a truck driver, I can simulate myself being a goat, I can simulate myself playing as a train, and there dozens of other simulators. But the one this breaks my heart to, I cannot simulate a girlfriend."
"It's not quite a substitute for actually sitting down with friends and playing the real games, but the selection of games on the workshop means you won't really run out of things to do. One of the greatest physics sandbox games ever made.   Player1 flipped the table in a rage! "
Best 7€ of my life
"Basically you get what's in the title. You can have a table online with other people, and play games together. Pretty straightfoward, and well-implemented it seems.  Of course the main focus of this is gaming. It comes with several traditional games (chess, poker, so on...and to my delight, Go), and there are optional DLC games, that honestly did not interest me one bit. But there is Steam Workshop and mod sites which let you play actual games, and more.   Since I have had this, I've gotten to play some new games I've never played before, and I discovered some old favorites on the workshop.   For something like D&amp;D, though, it can take some work. I haven't tried to run or join a game with it, but I think it would not be too much trouble to import maps.   It can also do not-so-game stuff, if you can find the tools (or figure out how to make your own). Anything you could do around a table, more or less. I set it up to do tarot readings, and that seems to work nicely.   The biggest complaint I hear is that it's expensive. That's really up to the buyer, and what you expect to get out of it. I would think it's worth it, but for RPGs there are other alternatives that don't cost $20."
i get to look at hentai in game with everyone on the tablet
10/10 would play blackjack again!
Game Within a Game.
I like how it's games within games.  You should vote for this.
PLAY WITH FRIENDS FLIP THE TABLE!!!
It's a game with infinite games inside it
"Fun game. Can do just about anything you can think, make a model of. litterally all kinds of games from turn based board games to automated black jack and poker, uno, all kinds of stuff. even a decent assortment of dlc  Wouldnt have over 1k hours if it was a ♥♥♥♥♥ game. just takes a little time to get used to. Scripting makes alot of things easy, back when there was none of that auto deal, convert, powerup magic, everything was done by hand, memory, and a couple of calculators.   Great game over all, other than the bugs that have been around for awhile. Community can be rough some of the time, but you can find some good games and decent people, even if you get shiteheads alot.  Huge workshop full of too much to describe here.  360/iluminutty  8/10 fix your damn bugs   Would flip table and rage quit again ad infinitum"
9/10 The table is just perfect to be flipped. Would flip again!
Removes the need of punching your friends in the face in monopoly. That alone may save friendships
really lovely
Literally the best time you'll have yelling at your friends over who is a werewolf or who has the most hotels in Monopoly.
So Tabletop Simulator in VR is legit.
I nominate this game for Game Within A Game award.
"Certainly worth getting, spent 8 hours on the first day."
"Annoying my friends by flipping their cards has never been so easy. Thank you, Tabletop Simulator."
I played Uno for the first time in years with my friend and his. Definitely worth the money for how much you get out of it with the Workshop.
"You can use Tabletop Simulator to play almost every board game ever made. If a board game isn't available for it, it's easy enough to just add the content for that game yourself as long as you own an original physical copy.  The possibilities it creates are endless, which is why Tabletop Simulator gets my highest recommendation."
 Early Access Review
 I nominate this game for the 'Game Within A Game' award
Game of all board games. 10/10
"Yes, you can play Duelmasters with this, it is the greatest piece of software ever made"
Finally I can draw ♥♥♥♥♥ on the table
I have always enjoyed this game since I purchased it I haved loved how open it is with the ability to play any tabletop game and get what to me feels like very natural play with the ability to play with any rules you choose and with the updates that it has gotten specifically relating to scripting its even better.
The closest you can come to the 'living room board game experience' on your computer.
"Honestly, whatever flaws this gem might have, it is an amazing game for the possibilities it gives you. Have a friend who moved away but you loved playing Risk together, or 40K, or even just want to play som good old Monopoly? This can take care of it for you. The intergrated Workshop gives you one game that gives you hundreds of other games. You dont have to buy this game and that game, and that other game there too, to get what this game provides. Fancy a game of Star Wars chess? Done. Monopoly? Done. Risk? Done. Heroquest? Done. Blackjack? Done. Even goddang Guess Who? Done. The sheer versatility, the options...11/10."
"Table top Sim. has been a favourite game of mine since the day I got it. I have spent countless hours (well I guess steam counts them) on the game. One of my favourite things to do is get home, plop down on my computer and play one of the many table games that the community has."
Brilliant board game simulator that keeps getting better and better. They keep adding substantial updates for it so it is well worth a purchase for anyone that likes boardgames
"The best board game sim out there, The possibilities are endless on what games you can play within it."
"Tabletop Simulator is, at its most basic, a physics engine that just happens to include a lot of game objects out-of-the box.  However, the ability to modify it and easily load games from the Steam Workshop (and only require them of the host, not all players) makes this extremely versatile. I use it to play the X-wing miniatures game with friends from all over the globe, or even from down the street, when we're both feeling lazy. I use it so my girlfriend and I can test out board games we wanna buy before actually getting them as physical copies. I play random games like Cards Against Humanity or Secret Hitler with random players from around the world.  I bought it on sale for about 7.50€. But I would feel like it's a good price even at the full €20. So whenever it's on sale - get it!"
If you want to play board games with your friends digitally buy this game and for them too (if they don't have it yet). The downside is you need friends to play this unless you just be like me and spawn an in game tablet and watch porn.
The game you need to play other games.
"Tabletop simulator is an interesting 'Game' if you can call it that, it's very different from any other game in that it's up to the players to come up with their own rules for play.  Tabletop simulator is a board game simulation program that lets people play board games you would normally play in the same room across the internet.  The game provides a decent amount of premade games and pieces to use with the steam workshop also supplementing this with custom models and game pieces. Essentially the game is very basic at it's core but is loose enough in it's functions that allows a very wide range of things you can do. I would of liked to see a few more features such as more board options and better drawing tools but it can be overlooked as they still update the game infrequently. I would also recommend having a few friends to play with as it's kind of the whole point of the game, I wouldn't recommend the game if you plan on playing alone or are uncomfortable playing with random players. Overall I'd say this is a great engine for creativity that could potentially provide endless hours of content if you can come up with the games to play or use the ones on the workshop."
You can make pokemon decks and play them. Thats pretty awesome.
if this game were scrambled eggs it would be tasty scrambled eggs
10/10 flip tables and play blackjack
"Time for a bunch of rambling thoughts in no particular order:  As a friend of mine described it, this is 'gMod but for board games'. The Lua update has only made this even more apt. If there's a game you've ever played (or wanted to play), it's in here. The #1 board game product for people with a severe lack of IRL friends, or non-standard work schedules. The board game world is so much larger than Monopoly and Risk, and that's not even mentioning the rabbit hole that is Tabletop RPG's. A great way to make (and occasionally break) friendships. All the fun of table flipping with none of the mess. Digital setup and aids for games that are normally clunky irl and easy saves/loading for games you'd normally devote an entire day to, but can now play in 2 hour slices. No cats jumping on the table. Realistic dice that are fun to roll. Rapid prototyping for any board game you might have in your head. Cheap and easily accessible digital versions of a variety of party games, both official versions and unofficial. Runs smoothly on a potato, but can take advantage of powerful systems too (did I mention VR?). Play games with irl mates that have moved away, no longer does physical separation mean board game night (or RPG night) is over. And more.  Buy it."
Buy this.
One of the best games I own. Great to play strategy games on.
"When I fisrt looked at this game to purchase I said why would someone sit down on a PC to play table games? Well now that I have it, it has grown on me. This game has a great community behind it as well as developers constantly pushing updates and making it better. I started a small Casino Community and it has taken off full speed with now over 150 members, custom games and a full TeamSpeak. This game is great for any gamer that wants to play any Card/Board game. Definently worth the money."
"Tabletop Simulator is not a game. Tabletop Simulator is a system for playing board and card games. It does this fairly well, and if you have a group of nerdy friends that are all willing to learn to use an initially awkward interface you can have fun with it. If you don't, there are public rooms available for games. This game is quite useful if you design your own board games and are looking for a way to test your prototypes with people online. There are a few communities of people that trade playtesting on this service."
I had to :c 
"Nominated for 'The most money saved through purchase' award on steam, and I think that's a glowing review for this game, highly recomend"
"This is a way to play any board game online with your friends. It doesn't know the rules of the games. It just simulates a table and provides controls for creating cards and pieces and moving them around. The controls are intuitive. The game mechanics are powerful enough to handle chess, Magic: The Gathering, poker, monopoly, dungeons and dragons, and pretty much any other board game you've ever tried.  It's better than the real thing because you don't need to get all the players in the same room at the same time and there's no cleanup afterward.  The HTC Vive support is immersive and works well, but is less efficient than the mouse controls. It works best when the vive is in room mode. In sitting mode, it sometimes selects awkward head positions."
"Nominated for 'The most money saved through purchase' award on steam, and I think that's a glowing review for this game, highly recomend"
"TL;DR: 11/10 +1 bonus point for workshop having everything you could ever want.  This game is absolutely amazing if you spend the time to learn how to make it work. Any game you could possibly want (that can be played on a table top). It has a pretty healthy community of people so if you play often enough you'll start to get to know the different people. Want to learn to play MTG, D&amp;D, Settlers of Catan and many more? just sit down at the table and ask you'd be surprised how many people are friendly and teach you how to play. the only problems is that there is a case of lag if everyone isnt in the same part of the world but it doesn't matter too much because the games can still be played easily. The game goes on sale pretty often but for the $20 price tag its absolutely worth it! "

"This is one of those games that is actually 1000s of games. If it exists in card/board form it's on here. I've found loads of new games I've never heard of and they are all very fun with friends. (Exploding Kittens, Secret Hitler, Fluxx, ...)  There are some games that require purchase and with good reason. It supports the creators and with all of the expansions they include its really a steal. I.E. I purchased Superfight for less than 1/4 of what the physical cards would have cost.  Buy this, play it with all your friends, and you will never get bored of it."
Warhammer for less money than a house. 10/10
I am able to play boardgames with friends who are far away... Whats not to like?
"It's a great pick up for anyone interested in tabletop hobbies, be it board gaming, D&amp;D, or just flipping tables. Just for an economic perspective: You're paying $20 (or less on sale) for an immensely diverse library of traditional games.  A few favorites: -Blockus -Millenium Blades -Ascension  Fun for the whole family"
"Allows you to play board games with friends over the internet, often without having to buy the board game itself (exceptions being well-polished DLC that are worth buying, regularly emulating board games in that only one person has to own it to play it). As long you can get used to the controls, an amazing game, one of the best $15 I ever spent."
  Thousands of amazingly complicated board games you're never going to play.  And then there's Maid DnD. 
"Excellent. Decents physics sim, amazingly done."
All the board/card games to play with friends and no one has to clean anything up afterwards! Yay! (ﾉ≧∀≦)ﾉ
"Decently optimized, looks good, as fun as the games you play within this game, even better with friends."
"One of the best party games ever, if you can find some friends this game can be an insane amount of fun!"
"With 13,000 + Workshop titles for this game, you can find essentially any board game in the world and try it out. I bought this to give Mountains of Madness a go and play Betrayal online with my friends, and it has not failed me yet. Great for UNO, too."
This game is amazing. You can save up to hundreds of dollars just by buying this game and utilizing the steam workshop. Definitely recommended for anyone who likes game night!
"  Like just get this game I have 1,000 hours + its good it's like Millions+ Games in one can't go wrong  I'm updating this for the steam rewards   All I have to say is Endless Possibilities and Endless Imagination in one game"
Endless possiblilities with the Steam Workshop!

If you play tabletop wargames or boardgames this is a must have. I play X Wing on this often and it's like the real thing.

I like the fact that I was able to upload and get my board game online within the first day. TTS is Simple to learn and is user friendly. I hope to figure out how DLC works soon as I don't intend StratiGem to be free forever. I highly recommend this for prototyping your game and online board gaming in general.   I would like to see DLC options in the uploader though as this would make it much simpler to get it done.

Great fun especially in VR. Played some singleplayer games and now am working on learning some multiplayer games.

"Alright, this game is popular many others have already nailed down why this game is so good(Massive replayability, large community, etc.) However, many have neglected some important things that suck about this game:   -Singleplayer exists; in a fashion: You can explore a table by yourself, but there are  NO BOTS  or any form of AI. Exploring a tabletop by yourself is just a preview more so than anything else. There are puzzles like Tower of Hanoi that can accomdate a single player, one can tell from booting the game up its made for multiplayer. Unless you have friends who'll buy this game, I recommend you stay away, as right now the community can be toxic(I write this as of the Steam Summer Sale, so after a few weeks the community will stablize, no worries.)  -Local play is rather complicated. Rather than explain myself:  [ http://steamcommunity.com/app/286160/discussions/0/540743212109092737/ ] http://steamcommunity.com/app/286160/discussions/0/540743212109092737/  [ https://steamcommunity.com/app/286160/discussions/0/620703493331290757/ ] https://steamcommunity.com/app/286160/discussions/0/620703493331290757/  [ http://steamcommunity.com/app/286160/discussions/0/622954302091716286/ ] http://steamcommunity.com/app/286160/discussions/0/622954302091716286/ "

 Early Access Review
Fun and full of friendly people to play loads of board games with
"This is not a game, it's rather a tool for creating games. And it's fine for that - I successfully implemented multiple board games in it whose I can play remotely with friends or family, when I'm not at home. Also, virtual board games for Tabletop Simulator are free, so it can save you some money... or you can try these games before buying their physical versions."
"After playing over a hundred hours in this game, I think I can finally create a good, unbiased opinion on this game.   As a disclaimer, I originally bought this game back in early 2015, a few months before it left Early Access. Throughout this time, I have seen many changes to the game. Both good and bad.     The Bad    I'll be starting off with the bad stuff. The biggest complaint I have against the game, is the lack of variety. This has been a thing ever since I bought it, but it has become more obvious as time goes on. Most of the games currently are Blackjack or Poker, Secret Hitler, and MTG. While these games aren't bad, and it is certainly easy to startup your own game, it's also a bit depressing to see these games as the only ones that are commonly open, with the more rare games quickly getting filled up. That said, you do have some other games such as Codenames or X-Wings, that are more rare, but luckily pop up a lot.  Another issue I have with the game, is the weird loading bugs that still occur today. These bugs may range from anything to your game refusing to load certain files and forcing the loading symbol to stay on your screen, to the voice chat looping over and over, as the game loads in. While these aren't game breaking, they certainly are annoying.    The Good    The game has an amazingly large selection of games to play, and more than likely you'll learn about new games that you never heard of, or knew how to play. For example, I never knew what Betrayal at the House on the Hill was, but after playing TTS, it has become one of my favorite board games.   Also, the community is generally laid back and friendly, meaning that you can easily get into a game and learn it without being mocked or belittled. Overall, the atmosphere of the game is very cozy, and you don't really feel unwelcome.    The Verdict    If you like board games in the least, Tabletop Sim is probably one of the best games out there for that. Even though the game originally showed off the 'chaos' element to it, the game itself is much more than just that."

"A very robust engine for letting you play tabletop games with your friends online.  A review for this game is not especially helpful as I can only really review the engine itself, and whether or not you have fun comes down to if you can use the program in the right way. A game played in Tabletop Simulator is only as good as the mod creator made it to be. A TRPG is only going to be as fun as the people you play with. That's just how it works.  Your first step should be to look at the Steam Workshop for a few games you might be looking to play with your friends, or think about which you might want to work on yourself. I myself added a mod to the workshop for a now-defunct CCG, and it wasn't too hard. Adding some resources for modding could be an important improvement from the devs, but with a little elbow grease, reddit / steam forum searching, and google you can find the answers you need without difficulty.  If you've got some tabletop games you want to play online, this is the tool for you. Still receives regular updates too.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=305502693 "
"If nothing else Tabletop Simulator is a great way to practice playing your favorite boardgames against strangers. I play chess against these people every few games and I still get waxed once in a while. If you have any boardgames you play regularly, TTS is right for you. Let these people wreck your ♥♥♥♥."

"You won? Flip the table, You lost? Flip the table."
"Its like Steam, but for tabletop games, except all (minus one at the moment) the games are free, and You can easily make new ones yourself, or just make a big mess from cards and dices and pawns and different boards on the table. And flip it afterwards, so no cleaning required. Oh, and no AI, so You better have some real, live friends to play :) (or find new ones on public servers)"
Great game for creating trust issues
It's literally games within a game. What more could you want?  Also you can rage flip with no consequence. Gonna let that sink in.

Good game and still being updated.
"Imagine a world where games ranging from Chess, Clue, Yugioh, Magic The Gathering, even Eels and Escalators, are all free and playable after purchasing Tabletop Simulator. Welcome to that world. In all seriousness, this game is amazing. The community workshop offers a wide variety of downloadable mods, which let you play all the classic games you remember growing up playing, or games you wish you played. And once you download the mod with your favorite game, you can play with other people online! And have a blast while doing so! I highly recommend this game, It's a blast with friends. Give it a shot!  10/10."
THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!
"My last review was not, well good enough. This game is worth every penny you could want, you don't even need a mic. Their is so many great games you can play and you should play them. this is one of my favorite games and i hope you'll like it too"

"Newish player (purple) joins game of Secret Hitler. Is assigned role of Hitler after being very trustworthy in first two games. Facists know Hitler, Hitler does not know Facists. First policy is Liberal. Purple player approves and listens for conflicts. Yellow chooses Purple as Chancellor. Unanimous 'jai'. Yellow hands over a Liberal and Facist card. Purple Hitler dumps Liberal, adds Facist, says no choice. Yellow backs up the triple Facist claim. Purple instantly identifies a Facist.  Eventually, Green and Blue are caught in a conflict, with people pointing at Blue (later inspected by Green, claimed Liberal). Poor Blue later gets shot. Purple Hitler was one of the voices leading to this shot.  Purple Hitler is selected again for Chancellor with a chance to win. Downvoted due to Liberal strategy trying to get a certain President. Later, Purple becomes President with 5 Facist out. Selects someone he thinks is Liberal. Vote gets approved. Draws 3 Facist cards. Shows them on table confirming sixth will come to win regaardless, then shows Hitler card to shock and amazement.  Purple was me.  10/10 would lie again."
THIS GAME IS AWESOME  BUY IT  YOU   MUST  BUY    IT

"I haven't put so many hours into a game before. This game is excessively fun and I stay up all night playing it. You can play cards against humanity and have big laughs with strangers. Or ♥♥♥♥ up in chess against someone and have a laugh about it. If there are any trolls that decide to mess everything up, you can ban them and rewind. Trolls cant do ♥♥♥♥ in Tabletop Simulator. The community is one of the best in any game I've played, and I will never get bored of this super fun game.  &gt;nominated for game within a game award"

 Summary
 Early Access Review
"Although a little laggy, this is a decent simulator which has nearly endless modding possibilities. People generally follow the rules, too. Can't say I was expecting that from an online community."
 Early Access Review
Boardgames are good.
play fun geme with freinds or by yourself most likely by yourself
I played chess against myself and lost. To myself.
"Very good simulation of a table that is very poorly, if at all attached to any sort of base.  The table can hold a great number of items, and I have not seen the table break yet.  The table can enforce game rules about as well as your table can, though.  Don't forget to break out the iPad with a YouTube music playlist for the group playing."
I love being able to play table top games with my friends online while one of them goes on efukt with the tablet and blast tard porn out of my speakers.

"This simulator shows more potential in gaming than anything I've seen since I first discovered emulators. The workshop community has already created a lifetime's worth of amazing board games, collectable card games, and others that are very playable.  Tabletop Simulator makes for an incredible party trick and it's in no small part due to the amazing workshop community that is supporting this game. Already nearly every board game or card game I could think of has been recreated in some fashion. It seems they are being updated frequently as well.  I've read that there are not plans to add in AI, yet I've already played Connect 4 against a bot online that was enforcing the simple rules of that game. This is very encouraging. It'd still be very easy to troll if one so desired, but by having the option to create and control your own games helps quite a bit and there's a step back feature which is nice. Personally, I don't see many of my friends jumping on this with me and actually playing games with me though. I sure would have loved to have had this as a teenager.  As with any digital simulation, this will never be as good as the real thing, but the benefit of having such a large catalog of games to choose from is an easy draw as well. I'm already daydreaming about building some kind of table touch screen computer specifically for this game. I could see this being a fun way to do game nights, though the novelty would probably wear off after while and ultimitately you'd wish you were playing on real board games with real pieces. However, the benefit of having such an amazing catalog of games available virtually also has its clear benefits.  I could see myself getting back into Magic the Gathering and other collectible card games because of this program since I don't have to shell out tons of money to get the desired cards for a certain deck. On this topic, this simulator could really use a search feature of some kind to sort through all the objects available to players. At the moment, building a Magic deck seems like quite a chore, one I'm willing to take on, but probably not one any of my friends would tackle. Maybe I just need more Magic playing friends. If I could conjure up cards by routing through a database and select cards that way, that'd be freaking insane.  Local multiplayer works well except a lot of games involve cards and therefore hinge on the idea of everyone being honest and not looking at the screen during a player's turn. If player's could check their hands and play cards via their smart phones, just.... oh man. That'd be the game changer for me.  As it sits, Tabletop Simulator is neat as hell. You'll enjoy messing around with it, probably play some games online and hopefully get a couple friends to play you in chess or something. If you don't already know how to play a game, playing on Tabletop Simulator is probably not the best way to learn, but it's doable. Definitely recommend checking this out. It could be the start of something much better."
"When I first saw this game I thought it was a joke. I thought it was just another addition to the growing trend of 'simulator' games (Goat simulator, grass simulator, I am Bread) that was more about the ridiculousness of concept than any actual gameplay mechanics.  I was wrong.  This is actually an incredibly well thought-out and functional game which is basically exactly what it claims to do: simulates a tabletop. Basically it's just a small sandbox that you can manipulate with your mouse and a variety of tools they provide you (flicking, creating lines, drawing on the table, and hidden areas being just a few) that let you pretend to the best of your ability that you're sitting around a table with your friends all playing a game of cards.  With each update this game has added even more functionality and accessability, and I can honestly say that this is one of the few games I have bought in the last year or so that actually exceeded my expectations. It takes some getting used-to, but once you've got a grip on the controls then everything should come together naturally.  I've personally used this to play checkers, poker, Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne, Dominion, and Magic: The Gathering. My friends and I even recently started up a group to play Pathfinder, and are having a blast so far.  Frankly, if you're a huge tabletop gamer but don't have the time to meet your friends regularly or are living far apart from your regular gaming pals (as is the situation with me) then this game will be perfect for you."
"Play bordgames with your buddies. Good for some old fasioned fun, and sneakily going on pr0n sites on the tablet when your friends aren't looking."
"This is the perfect game for those who played board/card games with friends and family. There are lots of pre-added games from card games to Checkers. With the Steam Workshop, the possibilities are endless. Users can create games found in their basement or use the power of imagination to make these crazy but fun board games."
My friend and I played meet and ♥♥♥♥ in this IGN 11/10
"sure, why not?"
"someone referred me to this as I was looking for a way to play/make some card games, this thing is good"
Puts table out on a beach to play casual board game. Learns that you can spawn in mini horses any time I want. Learns that mini horses can be made big horses with press of button. Creates horse tornado muc to the displeasure of girlfriend. :D  Amazing game filled with more possibilities than any other simulation I have played thus far. Highly recommend 10/10
Great game! Takes a little bit of a learning curve IMO
This game deserves to be played by everyone even remotely interested in the world of card and boardgames!

"Tabletop Simulator is one of my games that I was on the fence for buying, and the fact that it was in Early Access didn't really help my case for buying it. But I certainly don't regret buying it.  Tabletop Simulator shouldn't be seen as a single game. While a lot of simulators on Steam have one central theme with a large array of things to do, Tabletop Simulator, excluding the basic games it comes with, doesn't have a central game. And to people who are buying or considering to buy - the actual cache of content is built by the modding community.  Tabletop Simulator is a physics-enabled game experience, powered by games as universal as Chess, Go, and Solitaire... to family/friend favorites like Cards Against Humanity... all the way to complex and niche game markets like Betrayal at the House on the Hill. This is much more than the default games computers come pre-installed with. If you're still unsure, check out the Workshop.  There is support for single player, multiplayer (online), and hotseat (where one machine can locally host multiple players), so there are few limitations for Tabletop Simulator. Controllers work as well, with reduced options. (Hot seat can only take in one source at a time. If you have multiple controllers running on your computer, Tabletop Simulator will read the last controller as the de facto controller.)  The modding community is fairly active (at the time of this review), and the community in general is helpful, both with modding and learning new games. Modders and the developers offer resources for people to learn about modding, and there is a lot of support from the game and its community for modders to get their feet wet, whether they're expert modders, or trying it for the first time.  I would highly recommend this as a multi-purpose game, and as a game you can play with friends."

I lost a game of Uno and flipped the table 3 times.  Most realistic simulator I have ever seen
Yeah it's very good. If you like tabletop games you will love this. There is also custom models of cats and bananas.
I HIGHLY recommend this game its fun it also has fun workshop items AND ITS SO MUCH FUN
"its nice but not recommended for mac because it crashes sometimes. i mean, the game will literally freeze your mac."
9/11
"Finally I can do board games with my online friends, teach them mtg, and make mtg decks to play with without spending huge amounts of money. I have been also reins Pires to finish making my own board game and card game. It may take some time before I do d&amp;d on this, as I am used to and have images already on roll20, but at the rate I have been playing with this, I am sure I will prefer tabletop sim for that as well. I recommend this to all my friends, and I suggest whoever reads this also get the game. Card games, board games, and tabletop rpgs are all available. If you do not already like those games, this can at least give you a chance to try a wide variety."
"10/10 would play again gotta leave a positive review cuz... reasons,"
"Endless time of fun, you can finde any table top and crad game that you can think you and some that you dident know that are exsist and paly. so much fun for so much time. grate game!"
It says it all in the name...  'Tabletop Simulator'
Great for just about anything you could otherwise play on a real table
"Great fun to play with friends, especially if it's hard to get together to play boardgames. Needs bigger community to really enjoy multiplayer but overall, definitely worth buying especially if it's on sale."
"Impossible Game made me do it, would play again"
The impossible game made me do this.
"i had to do this to not lose at a game, but two thumbs up though (Y)"
russians everywhere   suka ♥♥♥♥♥/10
Great way to play tabletop games with your friends
this game is good to play with friends whne they are all far way or very close
"Very good game and has an unlimited amount of replay value of many various games on the Steam Workshop. Worth the twenty bucks its cost, and you can even make your own board games and upload, too! (ps. i've made a game :3)"
"Enjoy now before it gets taken down for all the photo copied games on it!  Also, Secret Hitler!"
""
through playing this game i've determined i can handle an actual tabletop
This game is amazing. I'm writing this review from a tablet that can be spawned IN GAME. Incredible.
This thing is simply amazing.
"Ok, this game has a lot of negatives, fair enough. It suffers from confusing controls, which is a trade-off for having the ability to manipulate pieces in all sorts of ways. It has an annoying griefer problem, though no griefer has done anything permanently damaging to a game. It can sometimes fail to load images, making cards blank and such, temporarily.  But, after playing 'secret hitler' until 1 AM, I'm convinced that this game has something great going for it. It isn't as good as having friends over to play board games, but it had the same basic feeling."
"If you love board games this is, hands down, an easy purchase. What's that you say? You like board games but can't stand rolling that dreadful 10 that puts you in jail? You got beat on the river card in poker? That's okay! Flip the table and let everyone know how you really feel! Beware of the kick button though, the host can just as easily get rid of you and rewind time and it will be like you were never even there.   They really did give the players an open world, board game, sandbox with this one, as well as the proper tools needed to maintain the integrity of the games when the classic 'Rage-Quitter' tries ruining your game. One of the better simulators out there, no question."
Very fun
"If you wanna buy this game, just pick 4-pack. Extremely good when playing with friends."
You know a game is good when you can write a review for the game in the game itself.
Playing chess with friend Checkmate Flip table
"It's like Garry's Mod, but on [redacted]."
Haven't played much yet but from what I played and seen this is a great alternative to normal table top games if you can't afford to buy normal TTG at least you can play most of 'em virtually.
"This is literally the sickest thing I've ever played, this isn't one game..... this is any game you can think of.  11/10"
"Amazing fun with a group of friends or strangers online; would recommend to anyone. The base price was a little high so maybe you should buy it when it's 50% off.  I personally enjoyed Chess, Poker and Secret Hitler the most"
"One of the best multiplayer experiences for you and your friends. In a sence, it's like being at a table with other people, enabling and sometimes enhancing the experience of playing card, board, and other games (not to mention, you can use the internet on a tablet together). It can be a great meeting place for groups, bringing you together as you chat over the internet but come together in one virtual environment. There's not much more to say about it other than it's a table and anyone can grab a chair and join the fun. A big part of this game worth mentioning is the Steam Workshop, which easily enables you to download user-created cards, backgrounds, custom dice, and 3d models of all shapes and sizes! I think the only thing that could improve this game even more is VR support (as sometimes it is a hastle to move the camera around)."
"You have a variety of games to choose from to play with your friends. This game is exactly what the title says, it's a tabletop simulator. So you can run any board or card games as you would in real life. You even get to flip the table when you rage.  (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻"
10/10 would play again
"Amazing game, with limitless potential."
Pretty cool game once you find the card/board games you want. I've had a blast while just derping around.
  BUY IF YOU ARE A BOARD GAME HED
  Must-Have For Board Game and Card Game Lovers
Had it liked it Refunded by d.ick friend
Epic times have been had. Great for friends who live far away or just don't want to come over.
"So far no problems, recommended with a mic for certain games. The community so far is very nice for the most part with some exceptions, typically everyone's here to play and do whatever. I used to play Texas hold'em nightly with random strangers every time, no mic, no turns, just us playing how we play. So that's a big plus, and it's very fun and gives off a nice feel.      I'm bad at reviews  "
"Brilliant for people that want to play boardgames with friends that live too far away for gaming sessions. Not the most stable of games but nothing too bad. Also, tons and tons of community made ports of games or even original games. "
I wasn't prepared to have as much fun as I did. Without a doublt I highly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys any type of game that exists. You're paying $20 for easily $1000+ worth of content. 10/10
"Fun and easy to use, with an entire workshop full of great card/board games. Combine different games and rules, or come up with your own, the possibilities are endless. Buy it, play it, FLIP THE TABLE."
One of the greatest things ever made.
"Best game, Its like I'm actually doing something with my life! (The Workshop is amazing for this game)"
Played Monopoly with some friends. Ended up on my friends' Mayfair with a hotel on it.  11/10 would ruin friendship again
"I don't bother reviewing most games, but this really is a must purchase. For the price of one board game irl you get a great simulator that allows you to play nearly any board game you can imagine with folks all over the globe, 10/10."
"Man, Tablets, cheapest tablet I have ever bought. 10/10 would tablet again"
"When you read the negative reviews, please consider two things. A: Trolls are only able to annoy you if you desperately want to play alone instead of with friends. And even then, you can, as a host, easily make them ineffectual. B: Since the alpha and beta, steam workshop and custom games have been added, making the selection of games nigh-infinite.  That said, my group of friends and I have played only a few games on here, but we LOVE it already. This should not be seen as a physics thing, or even a tabletop GAME simulator. It's a TABLETOP Simulator. The games have limited effects and rules glued to them by inept programmers. Instead, the modders give you the board, some basic figures and let YOU, the USER play the game.   Which makes this absolutely brilliant. No more weird Monopoly rules, we play by house rules here damnit.   A good example of this is the (now defunct, sadly, due to copyright issues) Munchkin game. A game where it's specifically allowed to cheat and play weird-as-hell cards that only have effects in context with others, programming this would be an absolute nightmare. No, this game gives you full and absolute control instead and you as the player have the power to play the game as you'd like, just like you would on a real table in real life.  I don't know how the modding is, so I can't comment on how easy it is to make games. But judging by the amazing games already out there, it seems to be going rather well. This one purchase enabled me and my friends to have hours and hours and hours and, in the future, months of fun with tabletop RPGs, boardgames, pen and paper, dungeons and dragons and and and and.   10/10 perfect."
"Real Life board games 2.0, except you can punch your friend in the face for throwing everything."
Flipping the table is the best part.  I also recommend downloading connect four from the workshop. That ♥♥♥♥ is infuriating when intoxicated :D
"You can play Cluedo online. I have been wanting this to happen for so many years, and now Tabletop Simulator has made my dream come true :D  Best game ever made i r8 8/8"
"The controls are quirky and take getting used to, but once you do it's basically a holodeck for board games."
This game is great for anyone who plays board games or goes to game shops
"Almost every board game you'd ever want, lots of servers and great community, and awesome sandbox that you can mess around with! For any boardgame enthusiast, this is a must-buy."
Has all the realism of sitting down with your friends for board game night/ dnd and everyone undeceive on what they want to play and sore losers messing with your pieces.
if you are a table top fan then this is the sim for you.
As a somewhat new board game fanatic - I love this simulator! Great for trying out games before you buy physical copies - but also allows you to play with your friends with whom you don't have the option to sit down and play physical copies. My best value simulator on Steam.
For when you REALLY have no friends.
Cool 10/10 would buy again
We have evolved to the point where there is no need for tactical family fun.  Only sitting alone in your room playing video chess with yourself  10/10 would waste life again
"You can draw anything, anytime, anywhere while doing anything, anytime, anywhere"
Very interesting. Workshop items are amazing.
"Best game to screw around with friends. If you don't have friends, find some!"
Fallopoly.  Soda.  Unexpected table throwing.  3/3 Would play with Illuminati again.
"Tabletop Simulator is amazing. It allows you to create and play any Tabletop game, and play them online. This software simulates the everyday interaction of the genre, such as picking up figurines, tossing dices, shuffling cards, and so on.  While it takes a while to set up, it is simply the best experience online for RPG such as Pathfinder and D&amp;D.  The only downside to it all is how easy it is to pirate copyrighted stuff from the workshop."
"I highly reccomend this game if you're planning on using it to play with your friends you can't get in the same room with very often. A lot of the mods aren't great, but the ones that are good are very good. Definitely a 7/10."
This game is really fun and full of madness.
"Very cool game for playing various board games online, even better with the endless Steam Workshop additions to play!"
"Playing Salty UNO with all of my friends is easily the best thing to ever happen.  Because that way, when I play a Draw 4 card and the whole table has to draw 4 cards, I don't get stabbed by the person sitting next to me, the table simply gets flipped (or not if I disabled it, so suck it Brandon)."
Endless supply of games!
The one thing that playing tabletop games online with your friends is missing is physics. No longer do you not have the ability to flip the table when your friend captures all the railway stations. Love it
Fun for messing around in...
"This is a great way to play tabletop games with distant friends or even games that you know you aren't going to finish in a single session and don't have space to simply leave the game out until the next gathering. It's also really useful for trying a game out before you buy it--and also convincing you that you really need to buy a physical copy of certain games! I could see this as a great resource for a game developer as well, as you can easily playtest things. Really useful!"
"Finally, If I lose a game I can flip a table without looking like a jackass!"
You can watch porn. Buy this game.
It is good with famliy
"I've been a tabletop war-gamer for as long as I can remember. For me, this is the best thing since sliced bread.  Love it and looking forward to learning the ropes and playing. I'm vision impaired and have trouble with small figurines. With this I can zoom in on my 46inch computer screen and enjoy playing."
"This exactly the solution to the issue of playing games that just won't work unless your in person, when schedules are tight, or simply finding a way to get everyone in the same place is difficult Tabletop Simulator solves the issue. Fantastic fun and the workshop can have pretty much any boardgame you want.   Do not buy this however if you are not the kind of person who likes board games, this has no extra gimmick, its just a virtual table (and whatever would go with it) that you can interact with as if in real life. Highly reccomended to anyone who likes board games of any type."
One of the best games i know
My life has now become shipping ponies and explosive marbles thanks to this game. 10/10 would recomend.
This is very cool. It doesn't keep track of rules for you and nothing is automated. But it's a space where you can play all sorts of games. 10$ pricetag for the winter sale shouldn't be overlooked!
"If Garry's Mod had a baby with a gaming table, this would be their glorious 8 lb lil baby Jesus."
"Combined with the Steam Workshop, it has every game you can think of. It is a Board Gamer's delight."
Paid full price and it's worth every penny. A definite must if you enjoy table top games and would like to play them digitally with your friends.
"When you figure out what you are doing, you can destroy everyone in your game of choice. Overall, fun. 4/5 stars."
Buying this 20$ is like buying a tabletop collection worth more than 200+
i cant stop flicking marbles thanks for breaking my hand
"I'm not the most creative person to write a highly detailed review on a game, so I will keep it as plain Jane as possible. Controls are pretty ♥♥♥♥, but managable. Graphics are minimal at best, so if yuou have a ♥♥♥♥ pc and you want to actually run a game at 'ultra' setting, Look no further. But, If you like board games, card games, RPG's, and everything in between, Tabletop Simulator is definately for you.   Me personally, I like to kick back, drink a few beers, and toke up while I play games with my friends (everyone has their vises). Open a card game up and enjoy with the boys. I recommend this game."
Needs VR support and more specialized manipulation mechanics for odd pieces but this is awesome.
Definitely worth 20 bucks
its like call of duty meets minecraft
"This game mostly contains board games, cards and ... board games. So if you like those buy it."
"Very fun, if your friends actually took the time to play with you..."
"It's a game wherein you can play board games and card games with your friends, and if you lose or get angry, you can actually flip the table with little to no consequence of injury to people. The title is accurate, it actually simulates Tabletop Games well. it's worth a buy."
the game glitched on me and now it says that i have less then 100 hours on this game but i have the 200 bade to prove that i had more than this i hope this will be fixed -_-
The Workshop makes it so that you can play virtually any board or card game. It's well worth the price!
beat you're friends they flip the table
Friend changed background to poo.  10/10 customizable background
if you like card games and board games you'll like this
Like Garry's Mod but with board games.
"Fun tool if you want to play board games with friends and you find it hard to meet, now we just need to get the schedule problem fixed."
I can play Waifu Wars. Say no more.
"Really fun with friends, only down side is when someone finds its to funny to flip the table over and over, not sure if that can be turned off though. Other than that its worth it."
Best Game N/A Placed a tablet and watched anime / wrote this review. Would buy 4 pack again to give to my imaginary friends. Worth.
"Great tool. Another way to play Betrayal at House on the Hill. And some other things too, I guess."
"Super awesome game, great with long distance friend!"
I started a public poker game and used the in game Ipad to show everyone hentai. 420/69 Would hentai again
(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
This is truely a gem of a game - a must if you enjoy board games. Get a microphone and play all the games - old and new with like minded people from all over the world. Well worth the money.
"You don't have a board game, no problem, tabletop simulator is here."
Flip Table is the only feature necessary
"So, this is quite simply the best game/program I think I have ever used. You can literally play ANYTHING on here."
really awesome table top gaming for friends that are not within an hours drive and still want to keep in touch.  add this with a voip conference and I can say it'll be a great evening.
this is a really fun simulator. would recommend you buy if you have friends that own this. lots of fun with a group
"Tabletop Simulator is everything you want it to be. Tons of games, and I mean TONS. Great controls, great physics, great internal chat system (voice and text), easy to join and create servers, and overall, just a fantastic way to spend time with friends or people you don't know. We've lost something in recent years: the joy of sitting around a table and playing a good board game. TTS brings it back. It's hard to get everyone together to play a game of Cards Against Humanity, Catan, Pandemic, or Betrayal in real life, but TTS makes it possible to play when you're thousands of miles apart. Plus, being able to play games that you don't actually own is awesome. Still though, please support the board game makers. If you like the digital version, maybe pick up the physical one too.  You will have tons of fun. This is a must have. Buy it."
"Get your ♥♥♥ to the workshop, the screenshots and video don't do it justice. There are some fantastic games on the workshop! Also there is a very friendly online community with lots of people to help you learn new board games."
"For f* sake. Bought this simulator 2-3 days ago. Now it's 50% off?! Fuuuuuuuuuuu* And I can't return it because I played over 8 hours. Of cource, no compensation. I feel robbed.   Anyway, it's a good simulator and a moneysaviour, thanks to incrediable mods like Star Wars, Settlers of Catan, Warhammer and so on. You can do whatever comes to your mind - sky is the limit so to speak. You either make your own games or you download mods from other users. Can also copy-paste objects, tokens and so on from mods to your own game! Not only that. You can play with friends online AND OFFLINE!!! Awesome!!!!! Controls are solid, you can use only mouse or keyboard and joypad. It's a fine simulator that will satisfy your neerdy needs.   Copyright holders probably dislike this simulator and mods because they won't make money - well that's what they always say. However this simulator is a perfect platform to promote games, as advertisement. I, for example, use X-wing miniature game. I customized a squad with cards I don't have. Thanks to that, I will buy requierd expansions to get does card. Bought X-wing most wanted today; so I can use Hortom Slam with y-wing title. Later on, I will buy upcoming Scums' Mist Hunter.  Again copyright holder let this simulator be, and you will get your money in the end. Please don't be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s? K thanks."
You know that one board game from Spongebob? You can play that on here...
this is a great game all i wish is that i had friends.......... naw this is fun just joining a random game but i think this would be a blast if it was VR supported but other then that its a blast to play
"Bought this for 9.99 at the humble bundle store and I have to say, I love it! I have played fallout monopoly, Cards agains Humanity, and my favorite Secret Hitler. The online mulitplayer voice chat makes this game. Everyone I have met in the community is so friendly! I can't to see how this game develops further, but I would definately reccomend this gamr. 10/10 IGN"
You can play any boardgame you can think of.
"This is the best thing ever created. One fee, unlimited potential."
The sheer amount of games that you can play with the simple resources given to you is astounding. It also helps you realise how much you would play these board games if they didn't require the set up and set down times. Everything feels smooth and satisfying.   I still need to play DnD on it.
10/10 would use to browse the internet again.
"Hi  Buyed this game to just play : Secret hitler. and well found so much more to play here. Worth it!, maybe even got my self a new few friends to enjoy cards games and steam with : )"
Every lobby you join is full of elitist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The game itself is amazing though.
"This software is pretty good, and seems to work even on a smart-fridge! (Don't try it, that's a joke. But seriously this thing will run on anything that support Steam). I love the tons of games available and even all the options you can do to make things more fun, including importing your own version of a game.  And even though there are a lot of brands here, other companies don't seem to mind having tabletop simulator have a copy of their game as a mod. Only wish more of the mods were still supported instead of dropped like a brick after a little while."
I can flip tables without paying for them
"Nice platform for creating games. Mainly for people who don't want to write code. Ton of free tabletop games to play with your friends(even from another continent), slowly improving interface quality."
Awesome game.This was money well spent but I do recommend that you wait till it is on sale so if you want to get superfight you are spending around the same for the whole game.
"Easily one of the best investments I've ever made. So many board game and card game options in the workshop and the simulator is very robust. Super easy to make your own custom items as well. Definitely grab this if you are a fan of board games, card games, DnD, or miniatures."
"Started making a D&amp;D map, kept shift+tabbing and destroying everything. 9/10"
Incredible.
It's fun to play this game with friends :)
"Game is very good and very well rounded. The workshop opens up a whole new set of games to play and create, as well as simple physics and controls once you get the hang of them. Quite fun to play with friends, presuming you have them, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ them off to the point where they, literally, flip the table. Great connection game with friends who also have it, bring you just that much closer to each other when playing some good old fashioned board games. Like for instance, in the workshop I got battleship, XL edition. 3 hours later, and all the ships are sank, over 400 pieces later, and a flipped table, and me and that friend are magically still on speaking terms.  tl;dr, looking for a great game to connect and rage at with friends? Buy this game. It's worth. 10/10."
Very enjoyable... controls can be kind've clunky at times. But the mod support is top notch! I wish you didn't have to have a copy for each player though.
At least you don't have to pay for a new table.
"very good game, well worth the money, near endless possibilities."
"This game could be a lot better with a lot more options and better interface... however, it is still a 'yes' recommendation as-is. Conditional on you knowing people you want to play with. Some in the online community are idiots."
"Ignore the screen shots. Ignore the videos. The real action happens in the Workshop. If you ever played a non-collectible card game or a board game (anywhere from Chutes &amp; Ladders on up), then this lets you do just that, but in a virtual enviroment with your friends online."
"Brilliant game hours of fun with online friends and people; with wonderful gameplay features such as the free range play, custom options, workshop subscriptions and possible DLC, and more ... even the servers are brilliant, quick and simple. Only thing I could fault would be getting pictures to work on custom features but I understand that the specs of the image have to be over the minimum etc. Awesome game ... would recommend :)"
"If you want to play a board game with a buddy, and you can't seem to find the time to meet up with them in the real world, get this game."
Eat virtual pizza with my virtual friends on a virtual table 10/10
"Great idea and well executed.  So long as you have buddies to play with, this thing is terrific.  Looking forward to more content"
"This program is an interesting sandbox that allows users to design gaming environments and interact with them. Others can join in for a truly interactive experience. There are no game rules implemented, and you can't 'play against the computer', so you need to already know the rules of the games you want to play.  The strength of this application is in its open framework that allows you to manipulate opjects however you please. This makes it useful for game designers and players who want to play games with others but cannot get together with them physically. Be aware, however, that if a game's framework (gameboard, cards, etc.) have not been defined in Tabletop Simulator and aren't available in the Workshop, you will need to build or upload it yourself.  Do not expect to be able to play games right off the bat - it takes some practise to get used to the controls.This also means that gameplay is slower than if you had the game in front of you (ex: picking up dice, gathering a won trick of cards). As well, your field of view is much more limited on the computer than in real life, but for some games, the computer screen is adequate.  I look foreward to getting more adept at manipulating objects and finding others with whom I can play a quick game of something from the comfort of my own home."
"This is a good game if you really want to play a board game with someone who's a few hours away. Some of the features are a bit glitchy, but that doesn't make it less fun. Also the Steam community is great with the workshop items they provide. It makes the game much more interesting when you add games that you love in real life. (Ex: Stratego, Monopoly, Cards Against Humanity, etc.) Overall this is a very good game."
"in all honesty, even though i have little playtime on here, this is a game that technically should be at a higher price, you get so many card and board games for such a low price, the only downside is that you meet alot of people who flip the table for no reason, but if you get people who dont and play a good match of cards or whatever you can have lots of fun.   i would donate money to this game. basically to put it to simple terms: if you buy this game you basically get more then 1000 games in one small online computer game."
best way to play tabel top games on the pc
Highly recommend this game for anyone and everyone who is a fan of playing cardboard and plastic games.  You can play almost everything that can be played on a table here.  So worth the money.  Easily one of the BEST games on steam.  I literally have nothing bad to say about this game.  You can find literally anything in the workshop.  Buy it now!  ....... Seriously!
"It's a good game, but most likely you'll be getting more fun out of this if you have friends with it as well. Thats not to say you wont have fun without your friends getting the game, but there are so many locked rooms, and most of the unlocked rooms are of a different language. You are able to play using just one computer, but at that point, just play it in person.   Postit: Its a good game, but you need to play with the right people."
"Playing games like Battlestar Galactica, Secret Hitler, RISK, and more with friends and having the option to save the game state and begin again a week later is fantastic. I like."
"Great platform for organizing tabletop games with people across the world, what you can do is pretty much only limited by your creativity and imagination. Adding your own art and objects is not the most straightforward though, as it requires you to upload it somewhere online first, but is not too difficult and allows for easy distribution to all players.  Drawing on the table allows for taking quick notes, but of course will mainly be used to sketch crude pictures of ♥♥♥♥♥.  At first it's easy to do simple mistakes with the objects such as dragging the whole deck instead of one card, but after a while the mechanics are pretty simple and flexible.   Would recommend."
Best thing I bough on PC this Year. With hundreds of Workshop games to choose from and a lot of good DLCs. I can see spending ton of time on this application. Do yourself a favor and grab this fast.
"Played a jigsaw puzzle with strangers, talked about boobs. 10/10"
"It's fun, neat, and grand and stuff."
"A lot of available games through the steam workshop. Great tabletop simulator, now I can finally play tabletop games with friends who don't live close by! :D"
Endless hours of fun!
"The controls can be finicky at times and take a bit to get used to, but it is well worth it to play a ton of boardgames online with friends"
Made me kill myself because i have no friends and play solo 10/10 would hang again
"Pwned? Have a temper tantrum and flip the table. No worries, it can be undone with the click of a button.  This game is the next best thing to being in the room with your crew playing whatever. I say whatever because you can play a crap ton of games in TTS. One thing you can't do however is play against AI as there is none that I've seen to speak of. For me that's a bummer as I dig playing solo sometimes, but as far as playing with pals, you're golden.  Hit up the Workshop for all kinds of madness to indulge in.   No restrictions, you can literally make your own rules, hell make your own game.  The price seems to be a bit extreme for this game, if I'm comparing TTS to what else is out there in Steam land for around the same price point, however I grabbed it on sale, you may wanna do the same if possible, unless you're a rich dbag who gets more dollars than a park bench gets @ss.  Find me on a Crazy 8 server and get rekt m89."
"If you're reading this, just scroll right back up to the top of the page and just buy this game already. Get your friends to buy it. After that be prepared for one of the best gaming experiences. Whatever you can do on a table, you can do on this game. I was very pleasantly suprised with how powerful the engine is.   In my situation I went out of state for college, so I now occasionally play a game with my brother and friends, and it is like I am sitting in the room kicking it with them, catching up, playing something as random as connect four or other games I don't want to mention because of copyright issues cause I don't want them to take the resources down.   If this game is on sale just do yourself a favor and grab it. My brother was able to play it on a surface with no problems. It is suprisingly not that intensive on your system.   Great community with about just any board or tabletop game is made and ready to download from the workshop.  I really just cannot say enough good things about this game.   10/10 would recommend"
"useful, especially for dnd meetings"
I'm sucking ♥♥♥♥♥ for $5 a ♥♥♥♥ suck.
"It gave me a few hours of fun times with my friends across the world. Can't see myself playing it for more than a few hours though.   In all seriousness this is my favorite game I own on steam, I reccomend it to everyone as I have fallen in love with it."
"Tabletop Simulator is a physics simulator at the base of it, but the amount of board/card games out there and not to mention board/card game you can make yourself in this game is incredible."
cool game with peeps and such
"Worth Every penny, You can Download so many really cool games to play from the steam workshop. Such as Cards against humainity and D&amp;D. Its probably quite boring if you dont have any friends to play it with but you can play with the community who are quite friendly.   PS, I Bought it with 50% off in the Steam sale,"
"Holy board games, Batman! This is a great game (really though, it's more of a gaming environment than a game). The steam workshop support is AWESOME, and it's a great way to carry a massive library of games with you wherever you go. Highly recommended."
"Can play Warhammer 40k without purging my wallet, what more could I ask!"
I use it with friends for remote GURPS campaigns and little hard to get used to but very powerful for settng up games once you get the hang of it.
have you ever wanted to play a board game but u have no friends? do i have the game for you!
realized tool mode is most incognito way to watch/look at porn. 11/10 would porn again
11/10
"Pros:  Let's you play a variety of mainstream games like: Uno Monopoly Life Clue ...etc...if for some reason that floats your boat.  You can also play a bunch of somewhat mainstream games like: Battlestar Galactica by FFG Secret Hitler Twilight Struggle Axis and Allies and pretty much every game on the top 50 or so games on the website  'Boardgamegeek.com'   Cons: Specific Board Game niches are not represented. As a wargaming Grognard, I have not found some of my favorite wargames like: The front series Age of Napoleon A House Divided among others.   For you warhammer fans, there seems to be many models on there. I have never been a big fan of warhammer, so I cannot comment on that.   Basically, if you want to play more popular games buy tabletop simulator.  But if you want to play more niche and complex games, stick to the free program Vassal AKA VASL."
"It is exactly what you probably think it is, and it does it very well."
I joined my first game and played a bit of Zombie Dice. One of my opponents placed a tablet on the table and began watching porn. He then proceeded to flip the table over mid game. I instanly knew this was the game for me. 10/10
Worth so much more than its price.
"Have you played Monopoly? It's here. Mafia? It's here. Settlers of Catan? You guessed it. WARHAMMER 40 FREAKIN' K?!? We've got you covered! I can guarantee you will find any table top games you may have played irl*.  *With the small exception of small, local and obscure games** **Even though I've seen such in the Workshop.  Buy this. Why? Because it's cheaper than ANY tabletop game. And you get ALL OF THEM. Of course, you're limited to the imagination of others who upload (not necessarily) their creations. All you need to do is subscribe to the collections (games) you need so that you may host them.  The community. It's great. I've made so many new acquaintances I enjoy playing a sesh of any game you can think of.  The value. Enormous. Good example - I've always wanted to start playing Warhammer 40k however due to financial reasons (and living in a second world country) and crippling debt, I was never able to order and/or play Warhammer 40k with anyone irl. Not that anyone here has any models. ANYHOW, back to my point - you can literally almost always find a Warhammer 40K game hosted here. It's like a dream come true!  The reasons. Plenty. You will make new acquaintances, you will play games, both old and new, you will have FUN.  The learning curve. Anything but steep. It took me approximately three days (not 72 hours in total) but rather three days of playing every now and then a game or two to learn most of the controls and key bindings to make the most of my gaming.  My thought on the game? Initially I was skeptical. The price seemed expensive, but let me tell you. Deciding to buy this during the Lunar Festival sale might have been the best decision I've made while I have been on Steam. This is probably my favourite game now. I'm not even overestimating. This is it.  If I have to rate my experience, I'd go with 9/10. Why? Because despite the variety of the game, there are always small bits and bobs that can be improved, or games and models can be imported with more HD values, but these are all minor inconveniences and should not impact your decision whether to buy the game or not.  Get this. GET THIS. WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS REVIEW!?"
Good fun when you can actually play with random people. Just had a great game of Settlers of Catan.
"A little difficult with the loading but other than that, very fun!"
"This game is absolutely amazing. I had some doubts about it being maybe too hard to use/annoying, but those all dissipated once I bought the game. It works perfectly."
"♥♥♥♥ing Phenominal, endless games to play, great online experience, deticatced player base. Lets flip some tables."
you can watch p0rn on the tablet  10/10
"Now when you flip the table in your Monopoly game the GM can just undo the flip and everything goes back to where it was.  This is a must have, regardless of what kind of gamer you are, because you WILL find something you love to play on it.  Pros: - Awesome. - You can make your own games sooooooo easily, and if you get into it, you can make really complex mechanisms and objects. That's awesome!  Cons: - Need to fix some connectivity issues. Then again my friends in Lebanon should really get a better government to fix up their infrastructure and make sure their ISPs aren't a bunch of crooks and thiefs!"
A great way to play board games with your friends when you don't have the actual physical board games and friends who don't really have the luxury to gather around for a few hours in real life. One of the best multiplayer experience with my friends I had in years and would definitely recommend it but you still need someone who knows how to actually play the game.  The workshop mods for this is incredible and you can find almost every boardgame ever created and some you wish was never made
"Tabletop Simulator is just an awesome game of games, with an endless list of games in the workshop, tools to create your own, and paid DLC games. All sorts of tabletop games can be played: CCG, PnP RPGs, classic board games... anything the community can come up with.  Best $20 I've ever spent on a game."
"Really great 'game'. Gives you everything you need to play thousands of board games. There's something satisfying about actually having to move the pieces, or shouting in disagreement about the rules of a specific game. Just wish more people had it :P"
"My mind is blown. You can play everthing, Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic the Gathering, Connect Four, Risk, Chess, DnD, and like everything else. You have tablets in the game that you can use to look up rules. or even go on youtube and stuff. Its not really needed I guess. But it comes in hand and its epic!"
Would be one of the most fun games on steam if more people owned it!
"This is the only simulator game I've ever wanted and it is the best way to play most board games with friends online. The only issues are with the legality of the games available, and sometimes the quality of the mods. That being said if you own a game and want to play online I think this is your best bet.4"
"Best played with friends, unless they flip the table, or like me, you don't have any friends."
Step 1:Open the game Step 2:spent 45 minutes in the global chat instead of playing the game Step 3:meet people in the chat and invite them to your server Step 4:spawn everyone a tablet Step 5:Best MLG simulator 2016  10/10 IGN
"I've heard of this, but only just recently gave it a shot. How cool is this?! Super versatile too! I publish boardgames and this is going to come in WAY handy! Awesomeness!"
"Every board game you've ever wanted can be found as a mod.   Bring your own friends to play with, or don't bother though."
"The potential for a true virtual table has been realized. I didn't think much of this when I first saw it, but after seeing the community-created content, I have become a believer in this technology."
"I have played legos, air hockey, d&amp;d, guess who (dbz edition), geek out (a trivia game), Pandemic, and just generally messed around with virtually every piece I could get my hands on. This game is hilarious and the Workshop support is Insane! 10/10 would rageQuit / deskFlip again and again!"
"Tabletop Simulator, where to begin. At first I thought this game was going to be a gimmick game, something I spent no more than a few hours doodling around with some friends before moving on to a different waste of time. I had seen little to no gameplay, and the gameplay I had seen was simple, basic, nothing more than a way to connect people abroad with a table and household games. I've never been so content to be wrong.  Before being gifted this game over the holiday season I had never had the chance to enjoy the nerdgasmic pleasure that is Dungeons and Dragons. Now, I can play with my friends that are 1000+ miles away from me. And no, it's not just, 'Hey, imagine this marble is a building.' No, it's more like, 'Hmm, if one of my buddies climbs this tree, what kind of vision will they be able to see through my Fog of War?' The amount of depth and character that is possible with this game is borderline incredible. In mere hours I, the DM, can create multiple zones that my friends can explore as I weave a story based on their choices.  Am I impressed with this game? Yes, I am. Have I explored more? No, I have not. Would I recommend this as an alternative to the physical game? Depends on your situation, but for me it's a great addtion to my library and, I would imagine that it would be for yours too."
"VEEERY GOOOD! It's a nice game, it reminds me of dandy 6000-in-1. All you need - friends, internet, this game, hands, pc and imaginition! Now you can make your OWN games with custom decks, tables, figurines and etc. WELCOME TO THE GAME, SIMUlATING OTHER GAMES!!!"
"If you like boardgames this game is a godsend. It's a no-frills physics sandbox with a bunch of gaming specific actions programed in (shuffle, flip, roll dice) Which board games can you play? All of them. Seriously, all of them. Every time I think I have some obscure game that no one has ever heard of, sure enough, someone has already put it up in the workshop.  It does sort of turn this game into Copyright Violation Simulator. I can't immagine 99% of the games up on the workshop are licensed or approved by the owners. That said, I hope rights holders realize this is doing more harm than good. I usually play games that I actually own because I know the rules well enough. I've also been introduced to some new games only to go out and buy the physical copy the next day.  Plus, if you happen to have friends who you like playing board games with who don't live near you, this game is the perfect compromise.   The only thing I would like to see in a future versoin is some basic scripting support for rules simulation."
"All tabletop games of the world, for only 15-20 bucks? Take it!!!!"
My only complaint is that I can't buy the 4 pack once I own the game. Everything else is pure sex.
I can flip tables with none of the consequences now.
"If you have friends this is the best game you can get. If you don't, buy it anyway and laugh in any server you find."
"Instead of paying $60 dollars for a game, get this. It's simple, dumb, and it's the best way to be a Pokemon Master Trainer"
"It's a good game definetly, I will admit that. Need friends who have it though if you want to have fun. Also a mic (as I was immediatly kicked from seemingly any game without one)"
Great game to play with friends
"Unlike most of today's 'simulator' games, Tabletop Simulator actually allows you to simulate the experience of playing a board, card, figurine, or even role-playing game at a table with your friends. It's a fantastically made game that not only comes with most common games, such as solitare, checkers, etc. but includes things such as tablets and calculators that can be used for games. Further, workshop support allows you to not only find other games, such as UNO, but to make your own game entirely, complete with custom textures, boards, backgrounds, etc.  Now, what is probably the best part about TTS compared to other, actual simulators, is that the mechanics are well made. It's easy to use, and has intutive controls that can be brought up at the touch of a button for reference.  If I have to pick one thing as a gripe, I'd say that the server browser does not show ping. It shows region, but not ping until you are in the game.  In conclusion, this is a must have. Not just for board game enthusiasts, but for whole families, for when they cannot play a board or card game together, such as when in college, or someone's in the hospital, since it works on most modern laptops that have at least 4 GB RAM."
your getting money hungery tabletop turn back on your path now 
"It's a really awesome tabletop simulator which allows you to play numerous amounts of boardgames, as well as card games."
"Fantastic:  It's exactly what it sounds and looks like, it's a COMPLETELY modable game with plenty of Steam workshop mods. I have been having a ton of fun with the vanilla poker set. It's a great way to play board games with friends without the trouble of actually having them over.  Completely reccomend it."
A great game for friends to hang out and play any board game you want. Constantly having something new brought to the workshop for endless fun. Wouldn't recommmend buying this alone.
Best Table flipping rage simulator. 10.10
"Best reason for buying this game is if you like Boardgames and maybe want to try out new games before buying a hardcopy. its easy enough to use, but i've encounter some bugs here and there, but nothing than small inconvenieces. If you have friends to play this game with i would recommend picking it up."
The amount of games you can play on this is immense. And you can play all those board games from your childhood.   In my opinion this should be a must have for everyone. You're buying one game but in reality you're buying a huge amount more than that.
"Seriously fun game. Funner with like 4 people playing, but fun enough with just 2 people playing. Definitely a game to try!"
"Despite not yet handling the best, this game is off to a great start. I seriously enjoy it. Cards against humanity and boss monster are my fav!  Feb 2k16 update: Controls are much improved thanks to a number of new shortcuts. New game favorites are Villages and Uno. An uproariously good time."
Friends will grow closer as they flip tables and middle fingers&lt;3
this cutting edge technology makes you feel like you're actually within the vicinity of a real table
You can flick your friend's pieces off of the table.   10/10 would flick again.
Nice Game I dont play it often but if its on Sale its a nice Game to buy :)
I LOVE board games. This app lets me play pretty much any board game I can imagine online with my friends. 16/10.
this game is good im writing this review in it its crazy
what could possibly go wrong
"Eh, this seems like something i can waste a bunch of time on."
The best thing since sliced bread.
People really need to stop flipping the table...
"Although the game was seriously buggy at first, it now has matured into a very usable platform."
"EDIT: I discovered that a server host can promote users, to allow them to spawn objects. So, scratch one complaint from the review below!  I had expected more of a gag/novelty out of this, but for actually playing all sorts of board and card games online, it works surprisingly well. Plenty of tools are provided for smoothing the process, like setting points on the table for objects to snap to, multi-level undo, and that sort of thing, and there's a visceral satisfaction in being able to treat the in-game objects like real, physical things. I expected most of them to be constantly falling over and otherwise useless, but you can really quite legitimately play board games online with this. There's tons of tools and toys to mess around with - even including an in-game tablet computer for browsing the internet at the virtual table. The clean controls and interface make it perfectly suitable for fully playing out pretty much any traditional board games and/or card games, from as simple as Checkers to as complex as Axis and Allies. It's far more usable than the half-joking physics sandbox I initially took it for.  If I had two main complaints, they'd be as follows: It'd be really nice if (trusted) guests on servers could add new objects on their own whims. If somebody wants to pull out the tablet, let 'em! The other, iffier complaint? The price. No, it's not that I don't think it's worth it. I was actually quite surprised by how well the program works. Rather, it's because this is the sort of thing you immediately want to recruit your friends into. But even with a 25% markdown for the four-pack, it's not something you can just frivolously buy for others, or ask them to buy themselves. That said, I'll definitely be watching for sales on the chance I can score some cheaper copies to share."
"Do none of your IRL friends want to get together to play board games? Well now you can play them with your internet friends instead. Have no internet friends? Well, that's kind of sad, but you can join an open game I guess.  Mechanics are amazing once you get used to them. Just make sure to download a decent mod for the particular game you want to play, as a few I've tried have caused players to have to reconnect to the server in order to make it playable."
Play almost every board game/card game on Tabletop Simulator. The mod community has added every great boardgame from childhood to all the great games recently released. Simple and easy to download and play them online with others.  10/10 Would ♥♥♥♥.
-Plays game against dad  -Flips Table
First and only review.   1. This simulator is extremely well done. 2. The tablet that they built in makes life incredible. 3. Unbelievable new board games for something new as well as all the classics to get your nostalgia going  I bought it on sale but regardless... it's more than worth the 21$
It is times like these..... Video games like these... That remind me..... We are truly living in one of the greatest era's of humanity! ....relavtively.....
One of the best purchases I ever made on Steam. There's almost nothing that you can't play with this!   BONUS: 'Gotta move these chess pieces back to starting positions... ' --RESET BOARD!- 'WooHoo!'
"Freaking awesome! If you have ever wanted to play a board game but had no RL friends, this is the cure!"
I dont have to spend thousands of dollars irl to play warhammer 40k. Thank you Beserk Games.
"Well developed and continually refined, I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to play board, card, or tabletop games online."
Really good if you have friends to play it with.
"Great game LOVED the fact that i could research stuff on it The only thing that i could say that is bad about this game, is that it is overpriced. I think it should be $10 because that is what i bought it for in a sale"
"My friends now hate me, and the feeling's mutual. We try to play normally but someone always flips the table until my game crashes. 1/1"
Play the game with friends Lost the game *Rage quit *Flip table 10/10
"Tabletop Simulator is my preferred medium for playing boardgames online. I play Memoir '44 with my regular opponent, and find the experience to be nearly as good as playing in person - and much better than Memoir Online. Actually, setup is easier and quicker with Tabletop Simulator, as I can copy and paste new tiles and figures quite quickly. Setting up an actual Memoir '44 scenario requires digging through my tile library, which can take a bunch of time, but with Tabletop Simulator I can quickly and easily create all necessary map tiles. I just wish I had ALL the badges and boards I own IRL. I play with House Rules of my own devising, which is incredibly easy with Tabletop Simulator, and completely impossible with the official Memoir Online."
this is a great game
"Soooo many boardgames, so little time.... This brings together two of my favorite things, my online friends and my love of arguing with my online friends. Get this game and spend countless hours arguing over many many different rule systems for the myriad of games on the Steam Workshop.  But seriously, this is a great investment. A lot of amazing people have done good work to import lots of your favorite boardgames. Have fun!"
One word. Runch.  https://gyazo.com/a8fa23af58ef4186d3bc8dc43deafc15 
"Ya know, Pretty cool."
Great game with awesome workshop add-ons!
"Super versatile simulator, play boardgames online!"
very fun game. You can play just about any game.
Game has already proved to be hours and hours of fun!
Great game to play with friends
Tabletop Simulator is a VR version of any game you can think of that you can play on a tabletop from cards to chess to puzzles you can search on the workshop for just about any board game card game even make your own and its also multi player
"This game is very good with some friends. Now, when I say good with friends, I mean basically unplayable without them. Joining random games is hard to set up since the rules aren't enforced, everything is open. You learn the rules of the games with your friends and play and enforce them like you would in real life. Most games have a tutorial when you join them, but if they don't there are videos for every game and the PDF files for the rulebook is just a google search away. If you have a group of friends who can play board games without ♥♥♥♥ing the table over everyone will have a blast! This game has been amazing to play with my group of 6 and I even play if it's just me and one other. Very good game, buy if you have friends who are interested in board games and mature enough to find the rules and play correctly."
"Good game, solid system with alright controls, needs some work, especially in the controller support/"
"This game is so good, that i felt guilty after getting it on a sale, because i could've supported the creators so much! Friends told me its a waste of money and that i should play real board games instead (which I do love still) but why should i do that? Will they ever actually have the time to drive over to my place JUST to play board games? No! This game has the satisfaction of playing board games that you loved and probably will always love thanks to this game, and the best part is, you dont have to clean up after yourself!   Cleaning up after a board game can be a pain and that's why some people are so hesitant to play actual board games. Oh yeah, and you can also play with those friends who moved away and they loved board games.  I rate this game 9/10 and I'll even say this game is for everyone, because their has to be one type of boardgame a person loves."
trolling is glorious 10/10 would flip table again
"Not as good as having a real table and having your freinds sit across from you, but I guess it will do.  I find it difficult to manage with the track pad on a laptop. I highly recommend a mouse or touch screen.  My computer gets extremely hot when I run this and it makes me wonder about the efficiency of this program since there really isn't much going on in terms of calculations.  I cannot say I recommend this, unless you actually are committing to it with a group of freinds which are willing to take the plunge with you."
I bought this game a day ago downloaded now i just played 2 hours 1.5 hour for finding server without password
Come and buy this game! *friends sold seppratly* Me: well I wanna buy this but I dont have friends *forever alone*
"Wanna play a board game that you dont own? Wanna spend hours screwing around with friends? Wanna meet new people who will probably swear at you in russian and tell you to ♥♥♥♥ off? Wait... no... thats dota..... ANYWAYS, great game. Spent hours in it playing endless amounts of games ive never seen or played before, as well as about half of the time in those 'oh-so-cool' blackjack casinos.  11/10 would crash computer again."
"Play 5ed D&amp;D with friends, even though we have moved away, we can still play at the same table."
"Good game, and works well for various game modes.  It would be made excellent if you could play against/with AI though, the lack of computer opponents lets it down slightly."
"So much fun and possibilities, really glad I made this purchse!"
"I can't recommend this enough. I got the bundle and shared it with firends and family, one of the best investments I've ever paid for. With the games workshop we haven't run out of games to play yet. This 'simulator' is played over most of my friends games. Get it now."
Game seems fun after trying it out for a few minutes. Wish I had more friends actively playing this game
"It's a physics simulator that lets you play with unfathomable user-created content. This thing is awesome. Thanks to the Steam workshop with this game I've played games I've always wanted to try but could never sink money into because 1. I'm poor and 2. My friends don't play board games.  The community gets REALLY empty on weekday nights (and late nights in general) but if you have at least a friend that has this game you can have good times.  I've had mostly good experiences with the community so far, BUT to be honest most players DO NOT feel like explaining the basics of the game to you, so read up on rules before you try new games.  THAT BEING SAID, even though  most  people won't want to explain the game to you, A LOT of them will. I've met extremely friendly people who were happy to start a new game with noobies and teach them as we play.  I paid full price and it was worth every penny."
This game should be included with the HTC Vive. If you have a vive - GET THIS!
"this is coming form the guy who HATES DND WITH A PASSION. great for dnd and mtg if you know how to import cards, and use workshop  includes so many features I'm not going to list them. "
"Are you a degenerate? Antisocial? Not a problem! From the comfort of your own home, you can play games that require social interaction with other basement dwellers, and pretend that you are capable of having healthy relationships with other people.  10/10"
Tabletop Simulator is a fairly interesting boardgame simulator. 
  Watched a stream. Completing Jigsaw Puzzle. 30 mins it took for a 50 piece puzzle. About to put last peice in. Flips table and pisses of the chat.  10/10 best troll stream material.
"i landed on the review square on 'THE IMPOSSIBLE GAME!!!', why the ♥♥♥♥ am i playing this, why am i even doing this?!"
Chess
You can now pull images from the internet to build jigsaws while playing smooth jazz. This is now the perfect game.
"♥♥♥♥ reallife now you can play games like DND or monopoly,,, EVRY ♥♥♥♥ING GAME! for 'free'  just buy this game and you can play EVRY table game you like."
"Joined a blackjack server, became rich, realised I just spent 10 hours of my life flipping cards and throwing coins around.   Cried.   10/10 wouldwould not have a social life again"
Flip the table simulator
"I love when you have spent hours on something, and someone comes and flips the table.  Cons:  No ingame feature to kill yourself when above happens. 11/10 "
"I bought this game with the idea that it would be awesome to play table top games with friends without the terribleness of going outside. When I saw this game was on sale, I bought the 4-pack immediately without hesitation. I was so excited to impress my friends with my awesome poker and monopoly skills. I then realized that I had no friends to share the game with and just sat down playing chess by myself for 10 hours...  11/10 would wollow in self pity again."
Board games with friends outside of punching range
OK! GET RID OF THAT RIDICULOUS SONG WHEN YOU START UP TABLETOP!!!!!! WTF WHY DID YOU ADD THAT??!?!   Love you guys and rating 4 stars now. Will 5 STAR it after you REMOVE this f'ing annoying AF kindergarten BULLsh** TUNE from the main screen.   Or F*7&amp;$&amp;7#&amp;&amp;#3&amp;#(858ing include an option to disable it. You F&amp;*# devs.   P.S. still love it though.
This game makes me happy :D
"No joke, this game should be on those lists of 'Games everyone should have', like CS:GO, Minecraft, etc. This is a legend of a game, an entire new innovation. The amount of things you can do, and how intuitive it is. Not to mention the devs actually care (which you don't see a lot of nowadays). I highly, highly, HIGHLY, recommend this game to ANY kind of gamer, FPS, MOBA, MMO, RPG, players, everyone should own this.  There's such a humungous variety of things to do and I'm saddened to see that not many people own it, when it is just a brilliant game."
"What can I say? It's great for family and friends. You can be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and flip the table if you want, this game is enjoyable for anyone really if your looking for a good time."
Play cards without the hassel and mess of actual cards... flip tables and ♥♥♥♥.
"An analogy for this game's mods (boardgames): Rule 34. If it exists, there is a digital version of it in Tabletop Simulator. Rule 35. If it DOESN'T exist, it will be made."
Now I don't ever have to see any of my friends in person. Just what I wanted.
"Very Good Game, I like it that you can either play practically every game you can put on a table, or just make up your own. This game has an infinate amount of possibilities and you can almost never get bored.  *Friends not Included"
watching hentai on the tablet is great would recommend
Writing this review from the IPad in the game. 11/10 Would inception again.
"Tabletop games are some of my favorite pastimes because they are fun, accessable to many different ages, and there's just something great about flipping/rolling/moving your own game peices amid friends.  But somedays... the conditions for gaming are not favorable... boxes are everywhere after a move, or maybe you need to save on gas money or your car broke down. MAYBE you're house/pet sitting and you can't leave. Well, this peice of brilliant software solves all that and is the next best thing to real life tabletop gaming.  I would give this 5 thumbs up if Steam would let me."
cheeky banter with the lads
"played monopoly with two friends. felt like playing monopoly.   workshop has every tabletop, card game, trading card game, and original games that you can think of.   to top it off, it has an ipad built in to it that actually browses the internet. perfect for looking up rules or distracting people with porn gifs"
Nothing is more relaxing and fun than doing jigsaw puzzles online with total strangers.
10/10 Would tableflip again.
I don't need to go down to Geoff's Toys to buy board games anymore.  10/10 The technology takeover has begun.
Is there a tutorial in how to take this game seriously?
&gt;puts together a puzzle only to find the last piece wedged under the whole thing  &gt;whole puzzle randomly breaks into parts  &gt;FLIPS THE TABLE OUT OF FUSTRATION  10/10 game and concept tho
Tabletop Simulator is a true gem of games that don't follow the norm and really caters as an awesome place to just chill out with your friends and play tabletop games. (and flip tables)
"Endless possibilities. You have almost everything you could wish for. It's a sandbox, but better. You can create your own games, playing tokens, tables and boards, import images and meshes. There's a tablet for simultaneous browsing and listening to music you can place on your table. There's endless content of games, cards and stuff in the workshop already.  You can start a multiplayer game and save and load tables and games during this. The community is decent. Most of them did not ♥♥♥♥ up my game on purpose but actually sticked to the rules and played along. Of course you can limit the possibilities to ruin your games by not giving others permission for several actions, but I was still positively surprised by how much fun this game actually is and how well it usually works out if you jump into games with others.   Didn't have crashes so far. Everything works fine.  Would buy again."

Very nice and polished game. Tons of options and very nice to play board games you dont have or even have but dont have a friend near.
roll 8 or higher to go deeper in your sleep
A game that helps with depression     10/10 would kill myself again
"It has its flaws, but in all Tabletop Sim is the closest you'll get to getting your mates round a table. It's an absolute boon for those of us whose friends are scattered all over the place."
"It is literally a boardgame simulator.   The rules are not forced, people can cheat.  The veriety is great, but most workshop items are not perfect... It's fun if you have people to play it with.   Do no buy it if you don't have online friends.  Real life friends are not the same thing, this only works with online friends!"
Do you enjoy tables? Do you like looking at tables? Do you enjoy touching tables? If so then this game is perfect for you. I would highly reccomend this game if you can convince some friends to buy it and play it with you. Not worth playing alone though but the multiplayer is a ton of fun.
 Early Access Review
Great game especially for long distance relationships. Some of the snapping could use a bit of refinement but overall everything works really well.
"I think that I have enough hours to make a review of the game. When I first bought it, I thought it was just a game to screw around in and flipping tables, but then I got more and more hours in it, and guess what? Its now my favorite game. I have made a lot of new online friends, more than in any other games. There are a lot of board games, casino games and strategy games that people are hosting, that you can be a part of (some a bit hard to learn)  Pros:  Hours of fun play Lot of different games to play within TTS Easy to make new friends Beautiful graphic, lots of details! Worth the money  Cons: Once in a while, there can be C*nts that join a game just to ♥♥♥♥ with things (they get banned pretty fast, so nw) Some games hard to learn, and some require you to have exp before joining  Buy, buy, buy!"
Played the game late last year and I had fun playing my friends in UNO and whatnot. We would play every now and then. We play today and see that there is a functional tablet capable of browsing the internet through an internet browser. We all enjoy watching the mother / daughter section of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ together.  10/10 would fap with friends again.
Played the longest game of clue ever and won.   10/10.
10/10  No sign of Griffith.
10/10 Watched porn with my friends.
"Perfect game to play with friends. If you dont have friends like me, well... You can cry while playing it alone.  10/10 Would play solo again"

Love this game
Copy and pasted 'X gon give it to ya' on the tablet till my game crashed 10/10 would recommend
"With a pretty hefty price tag, I wasn’t sure about purchasing the game. Twenty dollars to play something I may or may not enjoy is a pretty big ask. However, this sandbox game managed to surprise me. A game of Tsuro with a friend, and another of The Game of Life with some complete strangers, I became convinced that this game was well worth it.  The players were very kind and accommodating, and the few trolls that appeared ended up unable to do much harm thanks to the restrictions that were set by the game managers. The price is about a third cheaper than any one of the hundreds of games you can play through this system, and the few experiences I have had make it all the more worthwile.  I would definitely recommend this game with 4.5 out of 5 stars, and give my earnest thanks to its creators."
I'm the best Hitler around. 10/10.

Well if I had friends I could play it...... but for now I shall flip tables alone (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
"Want to play every board game in the world, but those games cost too much money, you have no friends, or you live far away from each other? Well now you can, for £15 you get to have all those board games, but on the pc...  Short version: -be nerd &gt;----------------↴ -be poor and ronrey ---------------------¦ -see steam game, tabletop simulator -- ¦ -many board games on pc -------------¦ -be happy nerd &lt;----------------------↲"
"It's the best thing for someone who loves boardgames like myself. Great design and community, most people are patient and will teach you how to play. Really, top sim."
Friends are not included :/ You have to buy them separately!
Best thing ever!
- I can play Go and Chess with this. - it runs pretty well on Linux and looks great. - the workshop offers some great extensions.  Now if only my friends would buy this game.  Edit: I got my friends to buy the game. We're having a ♥♥♥♥ing blast.
  this game is awsome 
10/10. Bought this game because I my girlfriend is currently taking a class for learning how to be a dealer of Craps. I am not disapointed at all. After getting them game I went straight to the workshop and found 'Real Casino Craps' Its true vegas style which isnt authentic to Califronia's rules for Casino's which require the game to be based off Cards. With little modification to the orginal this was solved.   Side note. We were playing Checkers when she realized that she wasnt confined to 'game rules' and flipped the table I've created a monster.
Better to buy this than monopoly standalone! atleast with tabletop simulator you can play multiplayer with your buds and watch porn on the tablet at the same time bwhahaha
This game should be renamed to Tableflip Simulator.
'You wouldn't steal a boardgame.'
Lets me write a review of it from inside the actual game. 10/10
honestly amazing fun. its a bit tricky at first but once you learn teh hot keys its the best way to play table top games other than in person.
"I wrote this review in game on the tablet, gg 10/10 would watch hentai on in game tablet again"
DLC ♥♥♥♥ing sucks But the game it self is ♥♥♥♥ing good Pros: Roleplaying Card game Making RPG making MAKING OF ANY GAME 3D models Custom models Cons: DLC DLC DLC Not able to use 3D models to walk around. 8.5/10
"This Simulator is really for table game,all play need youself to do like you really play with other people.  But DLC is too expensive,if you buy all DLC,you will cost very much,recommend only buy main program...  If you are rich,forget it."
that moment when you actually play something and not about to flip the table every two sec
so I can put my uno cards into a friend's hand without knowing? sign me up
To list the number of games I have played in this with my friends in the short amount of time I've had it would mean this review being obnoxiously long.  And they're free. Buy this to save money on physical games and explore a physics sim that lets you flip tables... all day long.
I got to play Eels and Escalators.   10/10  Would play Eels and Escalators again.
This game is just like having a real table in front of me wtf
Step 1. Open game Step 2. Start playing with other people Step 3. Lose Step 4. Flip Table
"This game is a must have if you own a VR headest, Shrink yourself down to the size of a chess piece and play life sized games."
game good. has vr support
"Play board games with the family to avoid this technology madness? Nah, I better play it on my computer."
"My first experience with Tabletop Simulator:  - Don't do the tutorial  -Join Black Jack  - Fail at figuring out how to bet  -Steal everyone's chips  -Win??  - No, people get mad and kick you.  10/10, would steal chips again."
Great software that offers tremendous possibilities.
Fun and intuitive. Super easy to use and the applications are almost endless.
Good cross-platform engine that has a community that has exploded in the creation of content. Very glad to be able to play some of my board games with friends that don't live nearby.
Love to play boardgames but can't get out to see the group? Well then do Berserk Games have the game for you! The perfect way to play games without all those pesky boxes and storage and travelling.
Surprisingly intuitive way to board game. Pretty good supply of multiplayer games. Mods are fantastic.
I love this game i can draw ♥♥♥♥♥ with friends and cheat all day. 
"This game is amazing. Period. BUT people with crappy computers, LAG, LAG, AND MORE LAG! :)  10/10"
Ruining Friendships: The Game
"OVERDOSED ON TAP WATER, 10/10"
"This is without a doubt the single most amazing game to get on steam. This game lets you do so much and play with so many others that its hard to believe it does not cost more. If you are a family then you should get this game just to play it with your family, and if you have friends thats even better. There is so much to do on this game that it's worth getting just to explore it by yourself."
"Perfect for classic board games. Home to secret hitler. Unfortunately, some board games cost money ($10!!)"
WE'RE GONNA PLAY A BOARD GAME LIKE A NORMAL GODDMAN FAIMLY SUSAN!
good games to play with friends
"I play way too much of this! Also, incredible, all your favourite board games and new ones, played with people around the world. What is not to like? Buy it! the value is absolutely incredible!"
"Great simulator, works well and has a ton of support for games on the steam workshop. Great for gaming groups that are spread out."
Played Betrayal with strangers. 10/10
"Board games are my favorite hobby. Even with a weekly game group, often I'm still left craving more playtime. Tabletop simulator not only grants that, it also allows me to try games before I buy them with a global audience. I couldn't ask for a better game, honestly. The future is here!"

&gt;gets salty during chess game with friend &gt;sees option to flip table &gt;flips table  10/10 for realism 
Played children's board games with a picture of Hulk Hogan for hours. 10/10.
You can never have too many ways to play Solitaire.
I put off buying this for too long. It is perfect. If you want to play board games online this is your best bet.
Finally I can play Sorry without mike flipping a real table and having to grab the pieces one by one while he doesnt help because I killed one of his guys. Now I just hit the undo button and everything is fixed now.
i dont even know how to properly playit
I'm almost done setting my game up.
"Well, pretty good 'system' for board games :) Works perfectly, I couldn't imagine better 'game' for something like that. 10/10"
All the board games and possibilities. ALL
10/10 can watch porn with friends on tablet
"This game, with the workshop, will steal your soul! There are too many supported games not enough time. Great for people who like to have a visual representation of RPG's but can't get a group together.   10/10 would have soul stolen again"
"As most people say, it's awesome being able to pay 20 bucks to play pretty much any board game you wnat (and then some), and you can even make your own! Definitely worth the pricetag. I love being able to play online with my friends. Hosting your own server is quick and simple, takes almost no effort whatsoever. From what I've seen, the community is pretty great compared to other games, as most people are willing to teach you how to play new games.  I suggest this game to anyone with friends and/or a mic.  (plus the in game tablet is awesome)"
"While more of a tool than a game in it self Table Top Simulator creates a digital table top for to play games on. A small amount of basic board games come with the TTS (Chess, Checkers, Go, Cards, Parchessi etc.) as well as some basic tools for running table top RPGs such as D&amp;D. There is also a vast community creating lots of great content for this game.  While the controll may seem a little wonky at first after you learn them the game is easy enough to controll and while the physics can be a bit wonky at times I feel this just adds a layer of slap stick humor to the experience. The game also includes various tools for creating your own content from giving you simple tiles with images pasted on them to importing custom models for making unique figurines.  Overall a wonderful peice of software that I whole heartedly recomend"
now i can cheat on my homework
"It's a great game.   It's just a shame I don't have any friends who play it, nor would play it if I bought it for them."
'Joins Server Called Sacrifice Your Soul' 'Theres A Bag In The Middle Of The Table Called Sacrifice Your Soul'  What...  Tabletop Simulator 2016 'Piracy The Game'    Help Im Addicted      
"Finally I am able to play Yu-Gi-Oh without going to those dungeon geek parties where there is always one guy who plays with Exodia deck but you afraid to ask him to play with a different deck because it is getting old after the 20th time, because he is the only one attending. And now I can have the same experience without leaving the house, how cool is that?"
"If you enjoy board games or card games in general you're going to love this game. This is because you can literally play any game you could ever think of. Along with playing my favorite games, I have also learned quite a few new ones that I've bought physical copies of in real life. If you're a game fan, i can't reccomend this game enough. Endless replayability. Also playing it in VR is one of the most fun things I've done in a while."
Best choice for 'game in game' award :D
11/10 would flip the table in a fit of rage again.
"This game is super cool, and great with buddies buy it and play it then use the workshop to play more."
"This game allows you to play tabletop type games with your friends that are not able to be physically there. While there are some physics annoyances, the devs have been quick to patch those that they find, and new content is being added daily. The graphics are very nice and performance is smooth. I cannot recommend this game enough. Well worth the money."
So Much Room For Activities!
Its not just a game within a game; its all the games in a game.
"Tabletop Simulator is a good way to play some games with your friends and or family. Board games / card games / roleplay games / etc you can find nearly everything you like. Try it now, go to the workshop and enter your favorite game, odds are you will find it. The controls are something most people have to get used to, due to the physic engine, but its worth the effort.  Be advised: Coordination of game groups (even of friends) is just as much a hassle as with real board games. Make sure you play the right games with the right people or your friends might explode over a round of Risk."
"This game is very fun with friends, but make sure you have friends to play it with. You can find almost any board game, and some card, imaginable. Even Jumanji!"
Fantastic game that utilizes both official and unofficial mods to transform from a simple physics engine into an entire board game collection. Looking to purchase the physical game but have no way to demo it? Check out the workshop and it is likely there! I have made the decision to purchase physical games after playing them on TTS. The other great advantage is being able to play with friends I have moved away from. We are still able to have those awesome board game nights and it can feel like I never moved away.
The cheapest way to play Magic The Gathering and if that isn't a selling point there are tonnes of other amazingly fun games on the workshop.
More fun than it deserves to be. Being able to play just about every board or card game ever online makes this easily one of my favorite games ever.
Why don't you have this yet?
I could not have asked for a better 'Game Within A Game'
I've spent over 100 hours in this messing around with friends playing boardgames and making tabletop adventures! From the frequent dev blogs and updates to the crazy workshop!  Highly recommended!
"Being able to play board games online with my friends and it is regularly updated by the community with all the newest hotness and some old board game classics like Heroes Quest? Sign me up for awesome!  Board Game Recommendations: Castlevania Kingdom Death Monster Cosmic Encounter DLC (Yes it is at a fee =( ) and many many more!  Highly recommended over Tabletopia! Plus there is so much else you can do with this compared to Tabletopia like creating a board game, physics building and table flipping!! (So much fun to scare the hell out of people when they are concentrating =] )  RATING: 9/10"
Hands down one of the best investments if games you can make. The workshop has almost any board game you can imagine and it functions incredibly well!
"One minute, you're trying to learn how to play Settlers of Catan with your friends.  The next, one of your friends tricks you into playing some deckbuilder game.  Then you end up doing a hentai jigsaw puzzle.  8/8"
"This is my all time favorite game to host, DnD, board games or general table flipping fun! 7 outta 7..."
A virtual table with a reset button. Way more useful thank one would think.
You can play funny games even if youre not sitting next to each other. Nice Idea. I like it
"The ammount of games avalible in this 'game' makes the head spin, if the community grows and the modders continue to add and create their own games then I can see this being around for a VERY long time."
This is awesome! Must have!
Best feature: Flip table  10/10 would flip table again
It's a lot of fun if you have friends!
well joined a game playey some blackjack hit on double 7 got 7 quit game uninstall gg
Greaterest game
One of the better games on steam hands down!
Best Game within a game hands down! Not only can you play popular boardgames but also try out and mod you way to experienceing new and undiscovered games!
"0/10 - Tabletop was not Mahogany  But seriously, table spent more time upside down than right way up. True story."
"Tabletop Simulator (TTS) - The game where I can play just about any boardgame I'd like to.   If a boardgame you have in your household, closet, or otherwise, isn't here, then with the right equipment and/or using a Steam Guide, you could put that game into TTS as a mod yourself.  A Warning : If you spawn enough objects in the game (let's say.. 800 Objects or at least 20 full stacks of poker chips,) and keep having them fall off the table and respawn, you'll probably crash the game first, or get to hear the really loud bloop, bzz, and glop noises from all the objects hitting each other."
"Really cool game and with all the workshop mods well worth the price. lots of multiplayer rooms to play them, can hotseat with friends, etc"
"One of the best coop games I own on Steam, and that says a lot. It's simply the fun and cozy part of playing board games this game caught, normally you wouldn't be able to sit around a table and play Ludo, chess, card games or whatever with your friends, but with this game you can do that and much more. Tabletop Simulator supports custom game modes, if you can't find what you want to play, just make it yourself, or just add in a pack of cards to the table if that's all you need. You can play anything from simple Go Fish to Dungeons and Dragons. This game is worth every penny."
"You dont need your boardgame with lost pieces and rules to play with friends, you can just launch this and it has it all!"
"Definitely worth the money because it gives you hours of fun! :) So many different games to choose from but my favourite is definitely the superfight DLC!  It always ends up being super hilarious and no game is the same.  I would so recommend buying this, especially if you have a lot of friends that aren't closeby, that way you always have something to play with em c:"
"This is the most valuable Steam game you could possibly have in your library. The modding scene for this game is insane, it's infinite content, forever."
So much fun with friends and the seemles incorpation of the workshop makes it perfect.
So many great uses for this program! A great way to play boardgames with people across vast distances!
"This game is the best way to gather up with friends and play really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boardgames, card games, or rpg games. Or you can simply create chaos across the table and flip the ♥♥♥♥ out of the table without it ever becoming broken."
The limit of games to play is endless! This game offers thousands of games to play and I haven't even gotten to play most of them yet. Definately a good purchase for a group of friends.
Great game with friends. And there's no packing up after the board after. Bonus!!
I play Dungeons and Dragons on this along with many other games. I have by far got my value for money for this game. A must have for any board or table top game enthusiast.
"  A great game to get together with far away friends, cause it's not even a game at all! The open nature of this sandbox allows for all the piece-flinging and card-hiding of a regular game in an easy to clean up environment. And basically anything that doesn't come with the game can be found in the workshop, so the virtual game cabinet never runs out of new things to try.  A lovely concept executed well."
I can play as Gaben on Wizard wars. 10/10
"It's a simulator where you play tabletop games with friends, what more do you need to know. Check out the steam workshop for a bunch of great tabletop games to play."
Table flip.
Great game to play. 10/10 will flip the table again 
"Who doesn't like Board games, honestly?  Very good workshop integration, but be on the lookout for workshop mods that haven't got all the models and textures complete either because they've been uploaded for so long the media links expired or someone just forgot."
Me and my mates solved a hentai puzzle
"This game has lead to almost unlimited amounts of fun with my friends. Even if you have no friends, please get this game, as you could potentially use it to play with new friends."
Play any board game you want worldwide.
Contains simulated tables and various things that sit on top of them.
"I LOVE this game. Its has infinate possibilities and opens so many doors.  Playing freely with other steam members is very interesting, even if you have no friends who like you......... The workshop is flooded with almost every board game you can think of and has interesting new concepts. The game allows ultimate freedom in playing and creating your games. You can script items and create an amazing board game experience. I don't own the DLCs but I'm sure they are great too. Buy this game.  Gud"
"Its 20$ regularly, and about 12$ or so on sale, for infinite tabletop possibilities, from monopoly to warhammer and magic the gathering, as well as the ability to make your own games and play them online with friends and faimly. Not only is this a great deal, its on a great physics engine with hundreds of features and the dev's are always out to improve; the game gets better and better constantly. Its litterally infinite games within a game. The 3d graphics are smooth and enjoyable, there are so many small things you can do that make this game a masterpeice. The mod community is great, and the deal here is amazing, 10/10, worth every penny. The only downfall the game is that there isnt a very extensive community for playing games, it seems like you have to wait a little to long to start a game of anything other than secret hitler or cards against humanity. Reguardless of this, its still a much easier way to play games with freinds and family at any given time on the go."
"its a game, inside of a game, with more games! YES LAWD"
"Great game that I wish recieved more support from valve. The game had great potential and could have surpassed most shooters but unfortunately, Valve decided it would be better to focus on cosmetics than the game itself."
Limitless possibilities through workshop content.  Lots of fun with friends! 10/10 would flip table again.
Great game to play with friends. Just be prepared to spend a lot of time in it and at the end not even finish the game.
Great game to play with friends :D
One of the best games you will ever play aslong as you have friends or meet nice People. O say its the best because it allows you to play praticly every board and Card game that exists You can even try out some games that you are not sure that your group of friends will like and get a feeling of it.
Great way to adapt almost any tabletop game to a form where you can play with friends far away. Takes care of tedious set up/tear down. Overall great experience for tabletop fans and great way to indroduce newcomers to the medium.
"Do you like board games?  Do you have friends that like board games?  Do you all have computers?  Do you want all board games, all the time, forever?  Buy the damn game. 10/10 haz the board games."
"You like playing tabletop games with your friends but are too lazy too meet up with them, or just simply living too far away from each other? Then this is the game for you. What is that? You don't have any friends? Don't worry. You can always just play online with other random people that also have no friends... like me!  Also you can flip tables. That is pretty fun on its own."
"It's a great way to play boardgames online with far away friends. A huge 'thank you' to the very active modding community for bringing boardgames into this, plus there are also official DLCs for some boardgames."
The limits are your imagination. Anything is possible if you try hard enough.
"Literally all the games you've played as a kid, plus more."
"An excellent way to play tabletop games with your friends online, whether it's games like Monopoly, Settlers of Catan, or an RPG Campaign! You can easily put hundreds of hours into tabletop sim due to all of the workshop content, so if you like tabletop games and have friends to play them with online, this is an excellent choice."
"Less of a game, more like an entire platform for so many other games! Best played with a bunch of friends on voice chat, but can also be used to find such friends!"
For the table nerds who:  1. don't have a table 2. don't have money for a table or 3. don't have friends irl
"Pro: This game lets you being just that classic nerd that you really are but didn't want others to see you be when you went to school...   Con: ...so that all your friends on steam can see it.  Conclusion: It is worth it though.. and also, extra pro: You can flip the table over when you're about to loose (as long as they don't know about the undo button) :D  Worth it!"
Saved me an entire basement worth of space in physical games.
Played it once.  10/10 would pay again
I recommend this Game and want it to Win ATLEAST 1 Award.  So for my Review: I fkn love this Game because of multiple reasons. 1.Who doesnt like board games? I mean every person likes atleast one and that mean they can play it online with friends and/or Strangers. 2.Replayability is really great i mean nobody gets tired of an good Boardgame and even if they do there are 4398203820395823075389047290438672309 others to chose from 3.Selection of Games: This game has nice Boardgame and it even has very very nice DLC but the BEST thing is the Workshop because everybody can upload or create their Favorite Board game
Absolutely fantastic game with almost unlimited potential. I love board games but a lot of friends are online so we couldn't play together in a way that was easy. Tabletop Simulator was the answer! With the Steam Workshop having possibly every game we could ever want to play it's hundreds of games in one. Recommend this 100% for people wanting to play with friends.
My game within a game for sure.
"+Very nice game to play with friends. +Community is nice, a lot of people will teach you a game. +A lot of games in one game (Free downloads from the Steam Workshop). -People can leave in the middle of a game and ruin everything."
There is no product on the market that better empowers gamers.
"Hundreds of games, unlimited hours of fun. If you are a board game addict or just curious, don't think twice, buy this game immediately."
just gor the lol's
"What is there to review of it, it is a physics sandbox where you play tabletop games, and a good one at that!"
"A true blast with friends, mods out the ♥♥♥, and the ability to remember the key controls so you don't show your cards to all of them."
You can basically play any board game with friends. It's amazing
Nice Tabletop Simulation - Even better with Workshop
"It's kind of like those 10 in one board games from the store, except a lot more than ten, and you can flip the table."
This is literally MANY MANY games in a game. Go nuts.
So much fun to play with friends~
"Whatever you can think of, this game probably has it. Infact even that one thing you forgot about? Yupp, the workshop has that too!"
If you and your friends don't get along when playing games you can copy and paste everything so you each have your own set to play with. Excellent.
Without a doubt a great simulator. Really good for playing games before you buy them. Huge selection of board games and a decent community.
"Epic game, everyone should buy it, play moar board games. Its awesome, fun, and educational... probably. Maybe. Did I mention its fun?  "
"Great game,"
"There are no limits. You can definitely play anything. There is tons of DLC and the amount of Steam Workshop content is insane. Think of any game and It's there. If your friends owns a piece of DLC they can join you, they do not need to own it too. The only requirement for this game is friends.  It's definitely worth every copper."
"It's a little difficult to get use to all the controls, but once you do, you can play pretty much any board game imaginable on this game. My only complaint is that it doesn't have enough games, there are a lot don't get me wrong, but I personally haven't found a whole lot of games I remember as a child. Bring more games, maybe a few more features, it'll be golden."
I was playing chess but somehow it became a roleplay where I seduced the enemy queen...
"Perfect for playing your favorite games online with your friends! Social deduction games become a bit more difficult, and the interface takes a while to get used to, but it's a great way to scratch your boardgame itch when all your friends are seperated."
"10/10, only way to play Secret Hitler without having kickstarted it."
"Probably the best of its kind, and Steam Workshop guarantees that this game will never get old."
"Played for less than 10 minutes and already gotten called multiple names, at least it was in English. It is like CS:GO but with less AWPs and more table flipping. I give it a 9/11."
"this is a game that can be best enjoyed with plenty of friends, if you can convince your friends to buy this and play with you, you should give this game a try"
"Alright, it's 10 PM now, gotta go to bed  Or maybe just one more game  Nah, another round should be fine  Wait, is that the sun?  11/10 would use this time warp again"
"Great game, wish I had friends to play it with though"
Game is actually quite enjoyable once installing the almost unlimted boardgames that you can find on the workshop. Highly recomended if you have some friends that are up to play some board/card games.
"Such a fun way to enjoy tabletop games with friends. The controls for handling objects is pretty fluid, although not always intuitive. For instance, when wanting to move an object, it is not always clear where it will land. For the most part, it's where your cursor is. Depending on your camera angle, however, it can be different which sometimes make certain actions like moving a counter or something across a smaller game board. That is about the only downside that I have seen so far anyway, everything else is very well made! I would enjoy a dark UI option for those late-night game sessions but other than that this a solid game for 'enjoying' a game a monopoly with your 'friends!'  Also: Don't even sweat the DLC for this game, there are hundreds if not thousands of other games available on the steam workshop for free, and actually some of the ones that are DLC are there too. Obviously, the DLC would be better made and have a more professional polish to it, but it's easy enough to recreate if you want to put that much effort into it. Also, only 1 person has to own the DLC for anyone to enjoy its so that's a plus."
Been playing DnD with friends* in it. It's great!  *Friends sold seperately.
It's a little buggy sometimes but ultimately an absolutely amazing game. Honestly one of the very best things I've ever purchased on steam! The possiblities are so endless and it's been a lot of fun playing with friends that live to far away too get together in person with!
"Easily the best game I have found on steam, I have sunk 300+ hours into it and that only continues to increase."
I laughed too hard to even play a game one time.
Pretty good fun to screw around with mates for a good time
Endless gameplay potential as long you have friends. The workshop really makes the game shine.
"Who wouldn't like this game?  Tabletop game is the game where everyone can play. Be it, kids, or adults.  This game filled with fun and activities you could never think of.  The only down side of this game is that it can't give you the feeling when you meet and play in real life.  I still recommend it though, even though the community in here is declining rapidly.   Buy it and we'll bring back the glory of the early TTS community!  "
BEST GAME WITH IN A GAME EVER
"Ok, if you don't have this game, WHY NOT?!?!?! This is probably the best value game on steam at the moment. Board games are back, and with a vengence. So many different games on the workshop, and some games you can buy as DLC. Don't let the dlc price discourage you, as only one person has to own it for everyone to play it. If I could have nominated this game for multiple awards in the steam awards, I would have. Game of the year for both last year and this year for me. I 100% recommend that you get this game."
1. Find a new boardgame to try 2. Get some people together 3. Oh this is hard let's play Secret Hitler instead 4. Why is there a banana 5. Oh wait why is it morning we just started
Play all the games you want in a game made for games. What else do you want from it?
good game to challenge meelad in chess
Cheaper than any board game or card game I've ever had (and it includes every board game and card game I've ever had).
"Great means of not only playing tabletop games online, but making your own and testing them remotely."
"If you wana play a game where all your friends draw ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ while you acually try to play the game, then here ya go."
Can play many board games with friends online.  Literally so many.  A whole community workshop full of them.  Can even play DnD.  What else would you need?
I love explaining rules to friends who'll forget them in 2 seconds!
For those times when you are feeling lucky...  Blackjack is not my friend.
Best Game to play with you friends and family
Game within a game. Cant be beat.
"ENDLESS GAMES!  That sums it up nicely. No longer are you constrained by who's available to play a board game in your house or area or if you have a physical copy of the game you want to play or try out. Robust community support. Whether your looking for classic, new, old, current hit, or even obscure, chances are you can find it or create it and play it! Great for trying out new games to see if you enjoy them before you buy. Highly Recommend!"
An awesome game! I can play almost any board game ever made!
"this game is pretty good, easy to set up, or join games, tons of games for free, and good variety and workshop support."
"This is a great program, especially if you and your friends live far apart and you still want to have game night. Not only that but it lets you test out a game to see if you like it before you go and shell out 50+ bucks for it at the store. (Highly recommended that if youfind that you enjoy a game you've played on here, look for it at your nearest gameing shop, already got a list for board/card games I gotta buy just from this one title alone.)"
  Anything can play For you are played So play this game Cause why not mate
"downloaded table hockey so me and my friend could play. Half a hour in, we just started throwing the pucks around and then my friend hit the flip table button.     10/10 would flip tables with friends again."
Workshop support sells this game.
"Endless Possiblities with this, don't be afraid to try werid sounding games on the workshop because you never know what would interest you"
"It's hard to review a game that is not really, itself, a game. Rather, it's a tool in which to play other games. It does that very well. It has multiple built-in components and also allows external modding via the Steam Workshop, so if a board game has existed you can play it in here (assuming either you or someone else has bothered to take the time to put it together)."
  i love card games and this is the only way i can play them with my online friends
Great to play easy games with friends when you are tired.
"Tabletop simulator rises and falls with it's community. The players create the many games that are available in the workshop for free, which is an amazing way to try out new boardgames. You'll have an amazing array of games to sample from.  This game is also a great tool to connect with friends I have moved away from. We play some boardgames like we used to, talking ♥♥♥♥ and hanging out on VOIPs. It does that job pretty great, even without the included 'turns' system, as long as everyone stays honorable.  The one downside is that the interaction with the board is a bit finnicky at first, but if you check out the tutorial section it starts to make sense pretty quickly. Protip is to learn how to flip cards and zoom in on objects and board.  Recommended."
Aweomse game to play with friends that are too far away to play normal board games with.
"Have you ever wanted to get in a group and play a board game with your online friends who you've never met in person? Yes? Well Tabletop Simulator is the game for you. With the Steam Workshop, you can play anything you want, as long as your friends are fine with losing. Then in two hours, you can flip as many tables as you want when your friends win instead, even after all your smacktalking. When your friends completely screw you in Settlers of Catan for no reason, flip the table. When your friends shoot you even though there's no proof at all that you're Hitler in Secret Hitler, flip the table. When your friends say they will absolutely not play UNO even though it's incredibly fun, flip the table. I think flipping the table is probably the best feature this game has. I highly recommend it."
The best board game mod with table flipping this side of something.
Everyone loves playing a game within a game &amp; trying to suck the universe into a paradox blackhole.
Fun with friends
"I have spent a good amount of time within this game, it is very usefull and the community of makers out there that provide various mods really make this sim shine."
You buy this and you pretty much bought every board game
"Do you want to play tabletop or card games with your friends but don't have time for the travel and no way to get to your friends? Fear not there is a way for you to avoid all that trouble. Introducing Tabletop Simulator which have a pretty big community which adds alot of different kind of board and card games on the steam workshop.  There is a big selection of games to choose from, you can play up to 8-10 people ish so no problem playing with at lot of friends."
Played a rollplaying game in which me and my friend fought over sexy goku 10/10
"Great game to play with friends, and yell at each other."
Absolutely fantastic. Being able to play board games online is simply great. Purchased games and a lot of fan made content from older games that are hard to acquire. Just a lot of fun.
I love downloading new pogs from the workshop
Best $10 spent for the return of literally thousands of dollars in tabletop games.
"This game lets you play pretty much any board game in existance with your friends online thanks to the workshop.  Thats... Really all that needs to be said.  Wait, no, you can flip the table in a rage when you lose.  Its fun. Get it."
"So this game should clearly be the winner of the 'Game within a game award.' This whole thing is about games within games. And if you really wanna get meta, spawn a tablet and start playing something on that while playing your game within a game."
This game is for everybody who wants to play boardgames with friends on the internet. You can find everything and refresh old memoreis and hatred for the games of your childhood.
Sumulates all the things!
"$20 for practically any board game, ever. 10/10 would recommend."
The ability to play various games with friends from all over the planet is amazing. The library and polish on this game are top notch.
Great fun with friends at any time!
Closest thing you can get to actually playing boardgames with your online friends.
Do you like boardgames but none of your mates are around? BUY THIS
"Flip the table simulator 2015.  9.5/10, would flip again."
very nice game!
"Dude, you can spawn in a tablet and watch youtube in a simulator about playing on a table....10/10"
"Fun and countless hours of possibility with friends, now if we just had the time together."
Build pornographic jigsaws with people you've never met
Best Board Game Simulator ever!
The “Game Within A Game” Award
  You can get Cards Against Humanity from the workshop here. CAH on Steam. That is all.
"Do you like playing boardgames? Do you like games with a lot of replay value? If so, then this game is for you.  I would probably go as far as to say that this game has some of the most replay value out of any game on the market, just because of steamworkshop integration. It allows the fanbase to make their own boardgames which means you can play anything from chess to monopoly and even more advanced board games such as Settlers of Catan.  This is also my nominee for The “Game Within A Game” Award because of my previous statement."
Great for those lazy nights when everyone wants to play a board game but don't want to leave the house.
"This game is ridiculous. There are dozens of different games you can play right from the start. Then you get into the workshop files, and there's even more games! But that's not all, you can even make your own! There's no limit to the variety of board, dice, and physics games you can play with this!"
Amazing value if you can ever get friends organized to play. 10/10
"You can play (almost) ANY board/tabletop game, It's INCREDIBLE"
"The ability to import games others have adapted for Table Top Simulator or make your own games and be able to play with friends across the country are good reasons to own this product.  However, the best reason is so you can draw insults on your friends' play areas in real time reminding them about how much fo a jerk their compatriots are in case they've forgotten."
Nice game to chill out with other players and enjoy some classic board games and some new ones. LOADS of games to play.
  Fun for the whole family! No matter what the game is
Best party game ever xD
Hours of fun
"The game is as fun and simple as it sounds. You pick a board game, grab a friend, and have fun. Not much else to it after that. You can play existing games, reskins of games, completely original games, board games, card games, RPG games, and anything else you can think of! It's extremely simple to create games of your own as well, only needing an image link for textures, allowing you to create game pieces or cards that you want most! If you have a good firend, I recommend giving this game a shot with them as there's hundreds of hours of content to be enjoyed!"
"This game is a must have. With so many different games avaliable in the workshop, you can play this game endlessly. Always finding new game to play and trying one you havent before is an awesome thing."
Ruin your friendships by playing monopoly through the internet.
"It's all of the fun of tabletop games with friends, but with a complete disregard for the space between those friends and any cleanup afterward. I cannot praise this game enough."
Thanks to this game i spent lots of hours shouting at my friends because no one remember the rules. I love it so much &lt;3
I played D&amp;D for the first time in this game. Love it!
Now you can play any and all board games with friends but with the added advantage of never putting on pants or leaving the house.
"Whenever my friends play this game, we have a set routine.  One person creates the server and loads the game. One person invites the players. One person acts as DM. Host turns off everything except ruler. Host invites me....  No flippy flippy :("
At least I can play chess by myself and pretend the other person is a friend.  Check/Mate
Many great QoL features with seemingly endless games to explore via the workshop.
"  Full review:  https://cublikefoot.com/2015/06/09/tabletop-simulator-game-review/   Tabletop Simulator, the game where I’m able to flip the table in rage when I lose at playing a card game I created.  Tabletop Simulator is basically a physics simulator specializing in the playing of board and card games. I’ve already played countless games (mostly chess) against my friends, and I can really vouch for the amount of fun had. We all had a blast playing the variety of games provided out of the box and the countless games provided by the Steam Workshop.  The game provides countless different customization options, both visual and mechanical. For instance, I’m able to disable the gravity and play checkers like I would up in space (which was quite entertaining, might I add). The table and background can also be changed. I can even have a custom table, with a custom image.  Each individual game piece can be maneuvered and modified with ease. The size, color, material, etc. The amount of customization given to the player is quite astounding. The actual controls of the game are quite simple. There’s keys that can rotate pieces and flip them (handy when dealing with cards). Decks can be shuffled and dice can be played with a simple shake of the mouse. The controls are very intuitive.  The game does feature Workshop integration, a fantastic feature especially for a game like this. With such integration, we were able to play Eels and Escalators, Uno, Sorry!, 3-man chess, etc. I’d go so far as to say that this feature is the game’s best feature, well, aside from the fact that you can flip the entire table in rage if you were to lose, which is also a key feature.  One of the largest features I haven’t explored yet would be the fact that the game provides an “RPG kit”, so you’re able to build and play your own RPGs. There are even some on the workshop, which is quite the amazing feat for what seems to just be a simple game. One could make quite the D&amp;D experience with such a kit.  The most glaring downside to the game would be the fact that if you don’t have friends to play the game with, there really is not a whole lot of fun to be had. Sure, you can play with some Internet stranger, but it’s nowhere near as fun as playing with your buds.  Overall, Tabletop Simulator is what I would consider a “must-have” game on Steam. There’s really nothing else like it and the amount of fun that can be had with friends is limitless, especially with the inclusion of Workshop support. Now, back to creating my own card game!"
"A almost perfect simulator for board games, pretty much every board game is possible. Just take a look at the workshop, there are already millions of classic board games converted there."
It's board games... most of the board games... board games are the best.
Like board games? Too poor to afford a lot of board games? Don't want to be near other humans in real life? BUY THIS GAME!
Spent a whole hour creating different jenga towers :)
GO DICE ROLL!! so much fun!
Play D&amp;D with your friends and yell at each other for throwing pieces around 10/10
"  They push the table flipping thing a bit too much, but it's still an excellent 'simualtor'."
More fun than you'd think. Great for friends who don't live nearby.
Top
So diverse in the types of things you can play in this game. Highly recommend to play with friends to have a great fun time.
Great game to play games with friends i you have them ;)
Best game to get when you don't have any social skills to play board games in real life with your friends. 10/10 would have no friends again.
"This game is worth your money for all the board games and card games you can play! Too busy to meet up at someone's house to play some board games? Have friends who live hours away, but you all wished you could play board games together? No worries! Tabletop Simulator's got your back!"
"As much fun as this is, if possible, be kind and buy copies for your friends! This game is really based on interaction and playing games, so the most fun comes from playing with friends and generally messing around. If that's just not possible, then there are plenty of random games online. Overall, this is a totally solid physics simulator, would recommend!"
"When you want to play a board game with some friends, but don't want to spend $60 on that game."
"A great way to play board/card games with friends and family who live far away (or if you're too cheap to buy a game then you can play it on here instead!). The controls are not quite as easy to use as if you were playing most of the actual games, especially the more complicated games with lots of pieces. But with a bit of patience it is a ton of fun! This game is especially awesome because the Steam Community designs the games that you can subscribe to in the Workshop and play in Tabletop!"
"Really great game with the workshop constantly being updated. The game is somewhat difficult to get used to as there are multiple hotkeys and each game could have special key bindings you must use. Other than that, its really great to play with friends."
"Good game, workshop is amazing, and I spent hours playing with friends :D"
"Excellent environment to test models and textures on. Just remember to use UV snapshots as .mdl files are not compatible. Oh yeah, it's also fun to play board games and cards on. If you get it, play Secret Hitler."
"Literally a game within a game. Tons of games to play, amazing workshop."
"Absolutely took me by surprise. This game was under the radar and really blew me away with how strong the community is and how much workshop content is still being made. The devs are constantly seeking feedback to make the game even better than it already is.  If you're on the fence, just buy it. You won't be sorry."
"This is not anything like some of those silly or just plain dumb simulators that are always popping up. This is seriously amazing, and the ability for anyone to upload a board game to the workshop means that you will never run out of games to play if you somehow get bored of playing secret hitler.   When it goes on sale, get multiple copies of the game for you and your friends. great for a casual game night, or a hardcore, several day axis and allies session"
'The game within a game.'
"I highly recommend Tabletop Simulator. It gives the ability to play all the boardgames cluttering up the attic/closet/shelves with family and friends that wouldn't be able to come over for a game night. While there are boardgame adaptations on Steam, some of which are quite good, the integration of the Workshop and the robust multiplayer setup lets you play dozens of games across the country without having to lug around the actual game."
Buy the game if you have lots of friends. Then just use the tablet and the game is golden.
A really fun game to sit down and play with your friends. It really does feel like you're all sitting at one table playing board games. Except this time you can play any of them in the world and for free. It's also moddable. :)  9/10
Can't recommend this game enough. Possibilities feel limitless
"Great game, for the price. Buy this and have access to hundreds of games on the Workshop or catch some of the DLC on sale, then proceed to play them with up to 7 others online or hot-seating.  A must game for any Boardgame lover :)   Reviewed and given the 'Game within a game nomination'"
"  Literally the most games within a 'game'. Tabletop simulator allows you to play multiple games (including VR) to make you happy.  Ranging from the friendship destroying Monopoly to checkers, this game is 'def' going to win an award!  No other games are like this, and it's one of a kind.  6/9 monopoly has made me lonely"
"If you like a game that has tons of games in it, a game within a game within a gam... You get the idea... Buy this game. It's so much fun."
"When it comes to board games, no other video game out there gives you the sheer variety that TTS provides. Whatever your favorite game is, odds are you can find it on the workshop, download it, and in seconds start playing it with your friends. The community is fantastic about creating authentic recreations of just about every board and card game out there, and many more that aren't. The controls do take a little getting used to, but they're fairly easy to learn.  All in all, a must-have for tabletop gaming enthusiasts."
"Why you should buy and play this game ? Because with this, you will hame another 100 of games to play and with friends, you will have endless amount of hours of fun !"
"Great Value, many fun games in the workshop, great with friends (but okay if you don't have any, you sad neckbeard). And always fun to flip the table."
I have never played a game that made me laugh so hard i thought i was dying. You dont even need real friends to play this.
An excellent simulator system that allows you to play boardgames and tabletop games with your friends or strangers. Great development team that listens to the community and is consistently adding new features and improvements.  Highly recommended.
Good game. Would buy again.
"Absolutely amazing, recommended to anybody who likes tabletop games and has a few friends to play with."
"Ok so here's the thing, if you want to fire up a quick game of chess with the computer, that's not going to happen. There is no AI so you have to find someone to play with.   The addons are all paid for DLCs, so you have to buy each game separately.   I got this in a sale for 7 quid.   This is a bit 'meh', but i'll give it thumbs up anyway."
"The one aspect I enjoy most in games is freedom, and Tabletop Simulator is whatever your mind could possibly come up with! The creativity in this game is just endless!"
HTC Vive VR review: I had never even heard of this came before I saw it for VR. I am usually the only one in a room with a VR headset on but I think it adds a lot to the experience so that its more than just 'board games on a computer'. Actually picking up and moving the pieces feels great and it seems like it was made for VR from the get-go.
"i can not stress how amazingly beautiful this game is. You can do anything. Whether you want to watch netflix or order a pizza, the option to do either and much more is always available. 10/10. no question, this should win the goty every year because it is the most entrancing, awe-inspiring, and moving game i have ever played and that has ever been created. It should also win the game within a game award."
10/10 Would flip table again :^)
"Amazingly flexible platform for playing nearly any board game you can think of, and plenty you can't. Controls are easy to pick up and there's usually people willing to teach games they're playing. Would be even better with a group of friends that are all into board games."
"Join the online community to play virtually any tabletop game ever made.   Don't have friends to play this with? Have no fear, you will make many friends in this game.   Are you a gambler? You're in luck. There are multiple blackjack and poker tables on every night.   Sit back, relax, and grab a drink because you will have a great time in this game."
"The most amazing tabletop simulating game there is on the virtual market. Have had hours of fun of playing games on this platform. Best part is you don't even need to buy the additional DLC to play, just find and download whatever board game you fancy from the Steam workshop and upload it in a room with your pals.  Pros: - Easy to learn - Easy to download different games and play them - Incredible modding community - LAN capability  Cons: - If you normally get dizzy fom games with a 1st person perspective or low FOV, this might create issues for you. - Sometimes buggy interface, assets that don't load properly - From time to time there are connection issues as well"
"Awesome game because you don't just get one game but whatever game someone uploads into the workshop. If you love board, card games, and etc. you should definetly pick this up"
"Tired of leaving your pc just to go to a friend's house to play a simple boardgame? Or head out to a local gameshop to play with friends to have a good time? Look no more, this simulator has every board game that you wished for. Oh? doesn't have the game you wanted to play? Well check out the DLC what kind of exclusive games they got to offer!  You can just enjoy boardgames just from a click away on your pc with this game, the gameplay and design are top notch with high quality details even when zoomed all the way in, this simulator just blows my mind how well it has been made and I would say this is for sure worth the money, especially when it's on sale!"
"If you have ever enjoyed a board game or tabletop game, this is what you should get. I love tabletop games but haven't been able to meet with anyone in person to play them for years. This more than fixed that."
"Grab a few friends, and delve into some games you remember from your childhood or find some new ones to trry. Bring the fun of board games online, now with no setup and cleanup!"
"This game is so much value for money! You can play absolutely any board or card game imaginable! From Munchkin to YUGIOH to Betrayal onHouse on the Hill to ANYTHING! Its great because many of these board games are $50+ so like I said before, such great value!"
"If you're a fan of tabletop games TSim is a must buy. Controls easy to learn. Super fun to play with friends, especially when you can't always meet IRL . Broad selection of games in many languages, many mods and an awesome comunity !"
Shrek card game  I play the donkey  He plays cory   love this game   
Perfect way to play boardgames online with friends. I use it mostly for DnD and it works wonders. The modding community is amazing. Get this game if you like boardgames with friends.
"Excellent little physics sim for playing board games online. Great for rpgs, obscure games, and the classics."
"So many boardgames, so little time."
Bought it for the memes. Was actually a good game. Literally can find a new game to play whenever you want on the workshop. Tons of value.
"A game of infinite games. There's a certain magic to tabletop games that will never go away, and this software allows you to experience almost all of them with friends around the world."
"Once you get used to the controls and remember to turn table flip off you can really have some fun with friends. There are so many games to pick from the workshop and if a game you want isnt there and you have the time you can just make it yourself, or make up your own games to play."
"One of the best sandbox games, countless hours of fun. It brings all your friends and family together even when you're not in the same household. 10/10"
Perfect for playing something simple like poker to a full game of Risk with friends!
DnD made easy. Like really easy
Test of friendship simulator. 10/10 would flip the table again.
"You can literally do anything, absolutely worth it"
"Tabletop simulator delivers a classic gaming experience using a video game as the medium.   It's for when you can't play games sitting across from one or more people: Cards, Go, Chess, ...  If you want to take a break from video games(inside of a video game) to play with your friends, this is the perfect choice.  When you play tabletop simulator, it emulates sitting down with friends to play a game effortlessly. Regardless if they're several miles away, or several thousand. I hope it continues to improve.    You could say(and I bet others have) that tabletop simulator is not a game in itself, but a platform in and of itself to play games through."
"If you're feeling alone or you're playing with friends, this game is one of a kind. You love playing tabletop game, that's perfect, you got it all here. There's some amazing creation from the player they have their own game or you could play a game that is already freaking popular ! Just perfect combination between fun and friendship, and way to tell everyone that you're a real freaking rage quitter by flipping a table and moving everything on the table to create disorder, such a fun time !"
Great.
Fun game to play with friends.
Do you love boardgames but not have friends in meatspace to play with?  This game will get you up and running with an online friend or stranger in short order. The X-wing miniatures modules are particularly well done.  I tried this in VR and am waiting on my Oculus Touch kit to go back. I foresee many hours wittled away in this once I do!
A very fun game of games. The workshop is overflowing with various board and card games. And the dlc is always high quality.  Not 100% useful for Tabletops though but certainly doable as well.
"Really, *really* awesome game if you like tabletops and have friends who like them as well. Definitely reccommend it, and one of the few that is pretty much worth full price too. Always fun to have a game of chess, uno, chinese checkers, puzzles... and the workshop is pretty extensive too! Though ticket to ride has yet to make it's way... oh well.  8/8, just make sure to have friends."
Games inside of Games instead of a Game~
"This game dosen't get old. Its great to have a serious game or just throw ♥♥♥♥ around to release some daily fustration. The workshop was a genius addition, as anyone can add free new items and game modes. It is incredable. I dont have VR yet but when I do, it will even be a larger can of fun I'm sure."
"If you want to experience card games and board games without the mess this is the solution. Have so many good laughs with friends in this game. If you are too poor and dont have time to buy the games and set them up this is the game for you. Get it, its worth it."
"Unlimited potential, feels like my youth playing random games on Garena"
"This is a great way to play all those great tabletop games when you can't get face-to-face with friends. Sometimes it can be a bit clunky moving pieces around or sorting cards, etc. but overall it's a good tabletop sim."
Great game to draw ♥♥♥♥♥ on a table with your friends. 7/10 not enough ♥♥♥♥

"For those who love board games, but have no friends near by(or friends at all) to play with.  An online community of board gamers from around the world, combined with a solid simulation of a board game table, makes for a solid buy I'm almost certain you won't regret."
"Make your own games, play them with friends. Either that or enjoy the amazing ones built and put together by others...the possibilities are endless.  This is a physics simulator with objects for anything you can use tabletop and beyond. Highly recommend this gem!"
"Currently this is one of the most fun Vive titles out there, however, the updates have slowed down recently. In spite of that, a dev on the discussions forum said VR updates are going to become more frequent soon, so thats exciting!  Looking forward to more VR support."

"I refunded Tabletop Simulator and I never got my money back :( I want my $20.00 back, or the game back. That isn't fair"
"The Workshop and Online Multiplayer are where this game goes from a mere OK to excellent.  The Workshop provides a large collection of games and other customizations you can choose from. Then, the Online Multiplayer lets you play these games with friends or strangers.  So far, I've found the Tabletop community to be pretty good. Most people are willing to help teach you how to play a game if you've never played it before.  The controls do take a little adjusting to but once you start remembering the buttons and figuring out shortcuts its very easy to interact with the environment."
"Best Tabletop in the virtual world yet. Unlike Roll D20 and other digital means to play tabletop games online, it keeps a certain natural feel to it that takes you back to when you played at a real table a week ago. The Workshop support is great and filled with plenty of games, I've even uploaded my own table for Numenera. The cost of this game basically gets you 100s of games as well as a small community you'll quickly be known in. I've been introduced to a ton of great boardgames due to this game. Great buy all around."
"If you're a board games fan, just come and get it. No excuses whatsoever."
Almost finished a game of Battleship once without flipping the table 10/10
.
"Tabletop Sim makes it possible to play virtually any board game over the internet...properaly. It comes preset with some classics (Chess, Checkers etc), along with lots of objects you may use for other board games (dice, various tokens, even monsters that actually move if you want to setup a role-playing game), as well as the tools to creating your own board game. Having Steam Workshop makes this game have endless replayibility, where you can download and play virtually any card/board game you can think of (Munchkins is really popular on here). Although most of these mods are copyrighted, and they have a chance to be removed.   Tabletop Sim has straightforward UI, with a very quick tutorial to get you used to basic controls. Hosting a game is extremely easy, and it's very stable as long as you don't load up too many objects.   Go for it.   ...and I thank the devs for supporting Linux :D"
 Early Access Review
Ever wanted to play every table top game online? Now you can
this is awesome!
"When I first saw this game i first thought 'Pfft, how boring.' And then i actually LOOKED at it and thought 'HOLY **** THIS GAME IS INTERESTING.' So, GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF THE REVIEWS AND HIT THE BUY BUTTON!"
"This is an extremely obvious, yet innovative game that I've always wanted, but just didn't really know that I wanted it until now. It's perfect for local games, with friends, as well as online. A must-own for PC. But, it is basically useless unless you plan to play with friends, so get it only if you're playing with friends. Orelse maybe wait a little bit for a sale, uncase you meet someone with the game as well."
Great game

"A game where you can play card games, RPGs, chess, reversi, and even eels and escalators!"
Beautiful.  Easy to connect. Very nice community.  Highly recommended.
"Yes, yes, yes, and again yes. Is it surprising that my friend and I immediately played a game of Magic? Not surprising at all. But then we, two grown men, spontaneously and without even talking about it, put together a puzzle - and that was awesome, too. The fact that you can play any board game or card game or TCG, of course that's amazing. But it's those unexpected moments that really make it magical."
"But the real question is, can I ♥♥♥♥ myself with it? The answer is yes."
The social fun of tabletop games without the hassle of actually being social.
"A very nice way to experience board games without buying all the sets. Helps when your prone to loosing peices. Also really good at creative orginal games. Really this game puts a little hope back in humanity where the game itself does not reconize rules, it is up to players to use honor and respect to abide by the gameset rules. It is nice to know that a new experience is just a load up away, and lots of good hosts who make games fun and teach."
All the tech in the world. Use it to play eels and esculators.
"tl;dr Edition: Perfect for people who don't want to buy a bunch of stuff for games or for people a million miles from home who want to play with their friends.  Swagspeak Edition: dis gam iz grate i luv it yolo swag #quickscopallcamping♥♥♥♥incod  I used to live in the US. Now I live on the other side of the world in a country where almost no one speaks English. For a guy who loves tabletop games such as D&amp;D, Settlers of Catan, and Magic: the Gathering (not a tabletop game, but stay with me on this), this game was a huge deal for me, because I can now play games with my friends. We currently have a weekly Cards Against Humanity game together, with awesome expansions including Game of Thrones and Sonic the Hedgehog (absolutely HILARIOUS).  Pros: + Very flexible UI and game physics. This was done on purpose so that you could basically upload any game onto the Steam Workshop and then play it. + Several games are available before you even go to the Steam Workshop. From a handful of card games, to a couple of their own board games, to chess, to even a basic kit for RPG's, this game has all the resources you'll need to play any game you can think of. + The devs work very hard at making sure you can post whatever content you want, copyrighted or otherwise. They believe in allowing players to have the freedom to play a game. There's a very big Warhammer and Star Wars: X-Wing community on Tabletop Sim (and you can imagine why. I'm not paying that much money for one army in a game I might play 3 times in my life). Whatever you upload to or download from the Steam Workshop should be considered lawyer-proof. + The Steam Workshop allows you to have virtually unlimited access to any game or mod you want. There are so many resources for things to add to RPG's, board games, card game expansions--anything you can think of!  Cons: - There are some bugs here and there regarding the game physics. There are constant updates, however, so this is a minor concern. - The user interface takes a little time to get used to. There are several videos online to help you out in this regard. - Handling objects in the game can be awkward at times, and objects don't always snap into place like you want. Setting up a game of Setters of Catan literally makes me want to perform Harikari. Thanks, Satan! - If you press me, I guess I would say that card games such as Magic: the Gathering can become tedious, especially if you didn't realize that you can set the snap rotation to 90 degrees until someone pointed it out in a video. Tapping cards is a real ♥♥♥♥♥ without proper snap rotation. But this con is me scraping the bottom of the barrel.  In sum, the game itself is a really great resource for people who a.) don't have the physical resources to play a game such as miniatures, boards, or card sets; or b.) want to play with people who live far from home. For me, both apply, and that's why I'm giving this a huge thumbs up. This is an incredible resource, guys. If you're a tabletop gamer like I am, this is a must-have. It is worth the 20 bucks several times over.  Total rating: 11/10"
"This is a fun game to play with friends who are too far away to go to your house to play actual tabletop games.  It comes with dozens of games, with many more avaliable to download from the steam workshop.  However, it does have its downsides:  1. It can be clunky. Anyone can just throw cards or dice or pieces around like nobody's business. Similarly, game rules are not enforced automatically. So, if you're playing chess, nothing prevents you from calling checkmate on the first turn by moving your queen behind the opposing king.  2. Everyone has to pay for this game. That means, for 8 people to play a casual game of poker, almost $120 must be spent.  It's good with maybe 3 or 4 friends, all coordinating to have a good time and not ruin it for everyone, but it's still better to just be together in person."
"Hello my name is Tiny Box Tim and i would like to make a review on.... TableTop simulator.it is a great game, you can download board games from the workshop and you start of with a few like chess, checkers, poker and more. you can even play how you like. But if you get annoyed then just flip that table like i do all the time just for the lols. Anyway i recomomend if you get this game then from the workshop if you have game of life has a board game a home then download it. Thank you for reading my review of TableTop Simulator. :]"
"HUGE FAN of this game. My friends and I use it mostly for our D&amp;D 3.5 weekly game, my girlfriend and I use it mostly for board games and such. I've been using it off and on since it was in early accsess and have been most pleased at how the Devs really seem to care about the game and want to improve it even after it has been fully launched. They are talking to the community on their forums and on Reddit and actually following through with what is needed/wanted.  The steam workshop on top of it all just makes it perfect."
"Fantastic MTG emulator. It does other stuff too. Product satisfies, and delights as much as it possibly could.   "
I played 6 hours straight of this game and i LOVE IT!! First it was simple i played dragons inn for my first time and on table top and people were so nice and friendly and teached me how to play and then i started playing smashup and it was really fun aswell and more to be had i strongly recommend this game.
this game taught me how to play poker. 10/10

"its awesome, if u have friends FeelsBadMan"
"Prior to the recent update as of today this game was absolutely amazing. Modding community is phenominal and gives an extremely large variety of gameplay.  Now you cant even do the basic controls. Grouping items seems to be difficult to the point of insanity. Camera controls are screwed up and The simplest tasks become confusing and complicated. Wait until the next update so hopefully they fix this, otherwise don't get it.   TL:DR  Version 5.3 Is worse than Windows 8.1   *UPDATE* EVERYTHING ABOVE ME IS NOW NULL AND VOID. THIS GAME MAKES ME NERD ALL OVER MY SCREEN. AND I HAVE A GODAMN TV SO THATS A LOT OF NERDING"
"This seems like one of those silly simulator bandwagon games that caught on just at the right moment when that phase was in full swing, but it's capabilities as an actual Simulator are much more than I anticipated.   This is exactly what it says. It's a simulator for a tabletop. What does that mean? Cards, Board Games, Pen and Paper RPGs complete with tilesets, building blocks, dice, you name it, you can do it. All of that, and more, actually, seeing is it has full mod and Steam Workshop support. Im a little surpised there isnt liquid physics to simulate spilled drinks and shed tears.  The utilites for this are whatever you want them to be!"
"I play this a lot, and it is one of the best things to ever happen. Get if you like tabletop games but can't make friends in real life."
Used a tablet to play darude sandstorm while i was playing chess  10/10
"The control scheme for this game was perfect before update, now i can't group ♥♥♥♥ as easy as you could.   IMPORTANT EDIT:  That Control scheme was messed up and patched right away, disregard the text above.  This game can bring friends together, and blow them apart just by playing Texas Hold em' without the danger of going to an actual game and not getting shot."
"This simulator is awesome! I highly recomend checking it out. Look for server that have willing to teach in the title and you can get into all kinds of tabletop games. The population is a little low unfortunatley, and there are those damn trolls out there. Go into it with the right mindset and you will love it!"

"Great game to just relax, amazing community teaching you new games, and people are overall friendly. Also alot of players are on so you can always find a game."
Its Good :)
This woodland elf bestows his seal of approval upon this game.
"Great game to play literally hundreds of tabletop games for hours and hours. I usually stay up until like 6 am playing this game. Great community, extremely rare chance of troll, most of my Steam friends are from this amazing game. No flaws in my opinion though there are frequent updates to fix any bugs of glitches so no need to worry.  Highest rating possible: 25/7"
"The simplicity of the idea, create a physics engine, and the materials needed to make boardgames in it, is something I am amazed it took this long for someone to figure out and implement. More of a 'toolbox' or 'front end' than a game itself it makes playing boardgames remotely, or even locally if you have enough computers, a breeze once you learn the few required hotkeys and turn on 'Semi-lock' in the options (and make sure you always play with semi-lock on so you aren't scattering pieces everywhere).  This weekend I played several games of Eldritch Horror (one of my favorites but just so time consuming on setup and take down) and Combat Commander: Europe with friends and the games went smoothly. The only recurring issue we had was that if a player was on the wireless extension it would occasionally drop and you would have to wait for them to reconnect and reload the files.  Other problems I seem to be seeing as well is that even though I tell the game to 'cache' the mods it seems to pull down the assets from the web every time it loads making it take up to 2-3 minutes for LARGE games (read War of the Ring, or EH) to load in. Aside from that though it functions exactly as advertised, I only wish there was a few more tutorials on creating new content as I have several games in my 300+ physical collection I would love to implement as I generally don't get them to the table that much due to setup time."
"This is the best 'game' on steam. If you love tabletop games, buy this."
"Bought the game, found Cards Against Humanity in the Steam Workshop, played it with friends, laughed.....A LOT."
"Wow this game is so awesome the possibilties are endless. I have all the pathfinder games and play with my family. It took awhile to scan the cards and there is some what of a learning curve to add you own games, but if you do it is well worth it."
This is the only fun real simulator game to come out during the era of 'Simulator' games Best to play after ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ them off in another game 10/10
Can simulate rage fits of flipping table  10/10 IGN 0/10 Metacritic
It's good.
"awesome mods, great fun!"
Pretty much the coolest game out there
Played this game for 3 hours. Thought of a new Tabletop game and got it set together. Would recommend.
"Love it, love it, love it! I've always loved tabletop games and now I can endlessly bug my friends to play cards with me! It's definitely worth the twenty bucks, but if it goes on sale, it's an absolute steal. It's easy to find people to play with on reddit or the Steam forums, but if your friends get it too, then that problem will already be solved."
"They commanded me to leave a reccomendation to the game, so reccommend the game i will."
The menu song is so catchy! ♥
It's a fun game if you wanna play some board games or something with friends. Mic is nice to have.
Simply Awesome
"play cards, flip tables."
"This game is awesome. The fact that it's a physics simulator means it doesn'thave that awkward forced feeling of most online board/bard games. If you and your friends can't all get in the same room to play a game, this is as good as it gets. I can finally have awesome games of Catan with my friends who moved away!"
Worse than Demon's Souls. 1/10 Too hard. Can't finish first level before I flip my table.
"Great Game, needs bigger tables though."
"Play your cards right, and you'll end up enjoying this game."
"Really well made game I just think that there needs to be more people playing it. And many of the games are a bit too complex to actually get into so for me it just ended up being a cards against humanity simulator. Still though, the possibilites are endless as far as the games you can create."
Everything about this game is amazing. If you have a group of friends hours can disappear just by booting Tabletop Simulator up.
"Play any board game. If this community were a little more active, I'd put it up there with Garry's Mod as far as must-have Steam titles go. You can find plenty of randos playing poker or cards against humanity or even Magic the Gathering (if you can agree on Formats and houserules), but ultimately, you're probably better off with friends with headsets to be able to quickly and easily negotiate the goings-on of any particular game.  Oh, and the ability to flip the table can be disabled by the host. That doesn't just happen all the time. It'd be super annoying otherwise."
Literally the only way I can play Yu-Gi-Oh! on steam with friends. It has pretty much anything I want when it comes to tabletop games. Change the name though. Not everything needs to be called Simulator just because it has real life aspects to it   8.8/10 - (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
"As someone who is actually getting into making board games, this game is perfection. I can test out all of my rule sheet revisions, or whatever else i need to test, without having to clear a space in my room. I'm really glad this game was made. It's become an indespensible tool."
"Amazingly well done, once you get the hang of the controls it feels just like a homegame"
"Great addition to your library if you're looking for ways to play those games collecting dust on your shelves with friends that don't have the ability to make a physical presence to every ol' fashioned game night. Of course, that comes with the eventual stagnation that every board game session can succumb to... but at least you can flip the table at the end of the game!  The Workshop community has done some VERY impressive work to add tried-and-true classics to your collection as well as fresh ideas that can change up your game-night routine. Hats off to the folks that have really taken the possibilities the author has enabled the community with (the tools and whatnot) and given this game a bundle of longevity in your digital shelf. It's not just limited to board games either, you're looking at card games, table-top classics with game pieces, and even salad preparation with yummy Hidden-Valley Ranch mods and a side of Doritos!  Oh, and if you really want that authentic feel, pull up the in-game handheld tablet and watch Youtube videos together. Or yell at that friend who's just looking at their tablet the whole time and not taking their turn because they can't get off their damn phone for 2 seconds while everyone is trying to have some quality time together.  Definitely a recommend!"
"If you like playing boardgames but don't have a local group to play with, or want to play something that takes more time than anyone has in one sitting, or any other number of reasons a physical play isn't available or optimal, this simulator is a fantastic substitute, and is only getting better."
"Had very fun with this as you can play a lot of popular board games with friends and strangers, where you control it like you would in real life. "
Pretty fun. Im leaving this review from the in-game Ipad thing. 9/10 would reccomend
"Fun at first, then it gets kinda boring... until you download a ♥♥♥♥ ton of useless junk from the workshop"
have freinds dont play alone and goat says hi
This game is super fun and handy for far off friends.
"Tabletop Simulator is one of those sucessful Kickstarter campaigns. It's a great game, even if you could call it a game, it's more of a tool in which you can play board games, people are porting real life board games into the steam workshop, and even making their own games especifically for tabletop sim. There's a lot of playtime here, even though my hours with the game can't prove it, i would strongly reccomend you get some friends to play this game with you. you'll probably waste more time with friends than with strangers. Also, DLC, Right as the time of this review there are only 2 DLC(SuperFight and Cosmic Encounters) which for people to play, need to also buy the especific dlc. but you can also pay for a more expensive version of the dlc but it let's you play with anyone that doesn't have the dlc. at the end this is a great game, i've been playing it since it was on early access and i can say that it is a must have if you want a game to play with friends."
"Two things I love about TTS is that I get to play games that I own many more times now, than I normally do. I've played games I mildly was interested in and found them to be so good and purchased physical copies into my library.  The second thing is the community. Berserk Games puts out updates every two weeks, focusing in bugs and features people want. Their forums are active with suggestions and the voices are directly improving the Simulator.  If you love board games or are new to the hobby, the Simulator has many people hosting and teaching games. Hours of fun to be had here!"
"A must buy for any board game fan. And especially for those people who always thought board games looked like fun, but it just wasn't convenient enough for their 21st century selves. Either way, you'll be happy you bought it. It is an absolute blast playing a game previously only played irl. Many said games can be obtained from the Steam Workshop, which imo is one of the best decisions the devs made. My son and I played a game of Axis&amp;Allies 1941 Anniversary Edition and it was some of the most fun I've had in a game in a while. It was in the workshop along with many other great board games. So basically, you can have any game you've ever wanted but couldn't get because they are approximately 80 dollars each.  1. Purchase Tabletop Simulator 2. Download for free ridiculously priced board games 3. Destroy your friends"
Throw Stuff around.Unbreakable Chess Pieces.Antigravity mode.  What else could ANYONE ask for?
Wanna play board games but don't want to have to actually interact with a physical person? Then this is the game for you
played eels and escalators.   10/10   would ride the eel again..
"Played checkers, followed by rage flipping, then played chinese checkers - followed by rage flipping. Then we started a risk game while listening to tunes playing from the in game tablet - 9/10 would flip table again to play risk"
"So you wanna play just about any boardgame with your friendos. But boardgames are expensive and take up space. Fret not. I present to you this simulator. Gained fame for having CAH, but it can do so much more. I want team speak intergration if it doesn't exist yet so I could play DnD with friends.  Its exactly what you expect it to be, and all kinds of mods exist for you to play basically any game you could imagine. Friendships being destroyed online hasn't been this easy since the creation of Facebook."
"A pretty fun game if you've got friends to play it with, but it lacks a lot in the singleplayer department obviously."
"Tabletop Simulator is an incredibly fun game when played with good friends. I've had such good times playing this that I've nearly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ myself from laughter.  I may have only 37 hours on record right now, but most of that is from 8-12 hours of straight playing the game with friends. It's a never-ending party.  The only problem with the game, other than some issus with running and connectivity at points (which are very minor and I find little issue in), is that you have to play with friends, or this game loses most of it's appeal.   That being said, I've still entertained myself thoroughly for a couple hours with inventive games from the Steam workshop.  So, if you have some friends, encourage them to get Tabletop Simulator with you. It's definitely more than worth it."
"Proof that the best games can be the most simple!  This game does exactly what it says, it simulates any board game you can think of (or create yourself for that matter!) it is quite easy to use to build your own games, and to create games you enjoy yourself irl, I have had alot of fun playing around with this already, you can play local multiplayer with friends or online, it allows easy implementation of custom decks and dice etc (Especially handy if you want to copy your IRL deck from yugioh or Magic).   Currently trying to get my friends involved xD   If anyone wants a game feel free to add me, I'd like to learn to play the more updated versions of some of the games and some of the ones I've never experienced due to lack of money before.  Visit my steam workshop page as I'll probably work on some mods for this, aswell as other games I have recently purchased."
"A real suprise of a game incredible value at such a low price, especially with friends. Almost unlimited amount of playtime as it never really gets old with new boardgames added almost every day.   Buy it if you want to have a really good time with friends or family!"
This is the best game for those who want to simuate playing board games with their friends because:  a) They do not own board games b) They do not have friends c) Both of the above  10/10
"ORIGINAL REVIEW: Infinite games in one. Online multiplayer. MAKE YOUR OWN RULES!?!?!?!?!?!  Why would you NOT get this? YOU BUY NOW! YOU BUY RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!  UPDATE: The base game comes with Playing Cards, a Chess Set, a Piecepack, Checkers, Dice, Dominos, Mahjong, and a huge table-top RPG set - and more. Those games alone would be worth the price of admission. (Just look at the price of other chess games and Solitaire packs here on Steam. Granted, there is no AI to play against, but still.)   There is even a CALCULATOR! Do you know much a calculator costs? That's like $1 right there. :)  But seriously, the true value of this game comes from the flexibility and expandability it offers through the Workshop.  Right now at the time of this update, there are over 5,000 items in the Steam Workshop for this game. Over 2,000 of those are full games.   (1,900+ Board Games, 1,900+ Card Games - I assume some overlap between those two, since some physical games could be called both. And I know that there are multiple copies of the same game. So I'm being very conservative in my 2K+ estimate.)  So, imagine of those 2,000 games - you only like 1/10. What price would you pay for 200 boardgames?  And remember - that's just the number of games available *right now*. That number has been constantly growing since release. There's no reason to believe that this is all that is going to be added.  Many of the games are actually game systems - meaning that you can play multiple games with the supplied items. Like a deck of cards, or dominoes. There are far, far, FAR more than 2,000 games playable on here.  In fact, to call Tabletop Simulator a 'Game' is selling it far short. It's not even just a game system. It's a system of game systems. It's really more like a Gaming Platform. A platform to play games on.  Like a table - only virtual.... a simulated table.... or a Ta&lt;CHARACTER LIMIT REACHED&gt;/"
learned how to gamble
"Howdy there do you like games where you can have a full deck of Shrek themed playing cards then this your game. I've spent too long playing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ card games in real life so I decided to do it virtually, all that changed is I am more likely to flip the table.  I now hate my life and wish I could remove this from my library!  A Cancerous Meme/10"
"One of the most fun games I've played in a very long time. You can play almost any game you can possibly think of if it can be played on a flat surface. If it's not in the base game, look for it on the workshop.  Best part is if you're losing you can just flip the table like a baby.  An easy 10/10. I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. "
Can watch adult things while playing D&amp;D. 10/10 - IGN xD
Physics are my fave 10/10
"The game where Jo forces us to play Dead of Winter, but atleast not Evolution."
"Pretty ♥♥♥♥ing great game actually, especially when you get more board games on it. It's like 1,000,000 games in one."
Probably one of the best multiplayer games I've played in a while.  10/10 would table flip again.
claims it simulates a tabletop and does. if your the kind of person who likes tables this is the game for you and for a bonus you get to play board games and stuff on said table like its more than expected   9/11 would buy.
"you need this  edit:  Probably one of the most consistently updated early access games of all time, if you enjoy boardgames with friends - this game is absolutely perfect for you."
"Great software, with a lot of development still going on.   Beside the fact that you can play games and hang out with faraway friends with the possibility of saving and continuing your epic boardgame or RPG later, this game is a perfect platform for developing, testing and even publish boardgames without the hassle of going to the printshop for every iteration. I just love this. The graphics potential is great, if you do your modding properly."
its p underrated
You can watch anime on a virtual ipad.
I went into a multiplayer game. There were four of us. 1 person threw the deck of cards on the floor one by one. Another person was drawing a ♥♥♥♥♥ on the table. The other guy was trying to clean up their mess. I pressed flipped the table button because YOLO.... 10/10
Do you like playing board games? BUY THIS!
Great game to play with friends. The steam workshop integration makes this game even better. I think you can play any games that you can think of.
It has so much to offer. Limitless games available in the workshop
This game would be awesome if I had friends
Great virtual board game environment with all the necessary features included. Well thought-out and implemented.
"A fantastic all-around game to kill some free time with, I would definitely reccomend it to anyone who wants a simple to use tabletop experience. "
"This game is great. Playing board games have never been so fun. All my friends hav this game and we all play a bit of d&amp;d ( dungeons and dragons).   Pros: +Smooth graphics and nice gameplay +Fun for all the family +Great one computer multiplayer +Very fun to create your own game (very challenging though) Cons: There isnt many cons about this game and i dont realy have anything i dont like.  Over all this game is amazing, its sandbox features give it a plus and buying this means you can get nearly all the classic board games considering this game has a massive communtiy making all these games for you to play inside this game xD. 1000/10 Will copyright board games again."
"This is quite the enjoyable game with friends, use the steam workshop otherwise you will run out of things to do quickly though."
"awesome, can do what ever you want, but it doesn't work very good on my mac, still 9.5/10"
"Get a group of friends, have a good time, then realize you ended up drawing something stupid on the table. Boardgaming's best friend, and even though Im not too into board games myself, I enjoy this game. Only some problems, and runs greatly on a pretty decent computer."
"This game is a blast! If you have others to play with and know the games being played. This game was made for social gamers, if you're looking for a way to play a game of checkers against an AI, you're out of luck. Its always wonderful to join a random server that isnt full or locked and see that the game is already halfway done, just to exit and find another. If you get this game, better get the 4-pack for you and your friends to play."
"Exactly like the title suggests: a tabletop simulator. You can play any kind of card game, board game, or tabletop RPG you wish. If it doesn't exist, robust Steam Workshop tools will let you make it, if you so desire. The mods are honestly where Tabletop Sim shines the most. And, just like in real life, you can totally cheat if no one is paying attention. How's that for realism?"
"Played dungeons and dragons this one time, we wasted 4 hours outside of the maze we were suppose to enter. And then decided to fight the random friendly old man merchant that showed up. We were warned not to but did it anyways and everyone died. 10/10 would lose again"
THE GAME IS DA BOSS OF TABLETOPS!!!!
"This game has the potential to rule the world.  I played so many different game online it's just amazing. I played Relic, Sttlers of Catan, UNO, Black Jack, Cards against Humanity and so many more."
"Easier than herding nerds in real life, plus the essential 'flip table' button! Good times!"
It made my dreams come true.
Yes i recommend it all because its fun in fact i made my own game with this didnt have to use real life stuff. pros: # LOTS OF FUN # I love sandbox # No actaurly aim (if there was then no dont recommend) cons: # a lot slowler than real life to do things # flip table REALLY NOW imagine a troll going on your server and flipping flipping flipping it all the time that would be annoying!
You can play almost any tabletop/card game imaginable the only thing you can't do is stop your friends from flipping the table in rage when they get rekt in UNO.
"I downloaded a game where you fight using your waifu's. If this game didn't get my recommendation, I don't know what would"
"Play every single card game you can think of, and make up your own as well!"
"If the idea of internet board games caught your attention, this game already has something for you."
So much fun! Awesome idea!
"Let's play the shot game. For everything that occurs, take the required amount of shots.  Someone flicks a piece off the table: 0.5 shot Someone stacks pieces on top of each other: 1 shot Someone draws a ♥♥♥♥ on the table: 2 shots Someone flips the table: 5 shots  "
"Best money you can spend. You are buying an unlimited number of games and when you loose you can flip the table. Zero Gravity Monopoly, Doesn't get any better than this folks."
"Just bought a 60 Dollar table top game of Pathfinder Adventure card game(Totally worth it btw) And then... I buy this game a single day later and see the SAME DAMN GAME, AND WITH ALL THE EXPANSIONS"
Loads of fun!!!!
Plenty of funny tabletop games in a single digital one.   Gameplay
"Works as advertised! I've used this to play the Game of Thrones board game with my friends. In my opinion, this game will live and die with the modding community."
Better than DotA.
fun with many possibilities. laid back gaming
10/10 watching videos with friends lol
"This is a lot of fun, but only if you have friends that you actually play with. When you join random groups without knowing anyone you can get lucky and find fun groups to play with and stuff, but for the most part you just get groups that annoy you and you leave the game and then spend forever trying to find someone you want to play with. I suggest getting a group of friends to get the game together so you can play. ^_^"
I enjoyed this game. The 'flip the table' feature is quite useful when you're playing with someone and they do something you don't like.
"If you enjoy board games, card games, and dice, then you will enjoy this game.  Tabletop Simulator allows you to play virtually any type of board or card game that you want, with multiplayer, both locally and over the internet. You can save your games for later without leaving the board out; and you don't have to set up, clean up the board or pick up the cards afterwards. Once you get used to the controls (which has a brief, but informative tutorial) then it is very slick and natural.  It also has Steam Workshop support and an editor with already thousands of great games available as easy, free add-ons. That means you get THOUSANDS of games for cheaper than buying a single real-life board game.  Such an awesome idea that is executed very well.  2 thumbs up! 10/10! Highly recommend it."
"Not that I would tell that you can do anything you want, because you can."
"cool way to get your boardgame fix,ps we are in a board game renaissance. shout out to geek and sundry/will weatons tabel top "
Started playing Monopoly at 1am. Finished that 1 game at 10am.  9/10 - no too shabby
This game/program is exactly what I wanted and have been waiting for in order to play board games with friends and family long distance.  It is well executed with meaningful updates and a healthy amount of free mods. They are starting to get official DLC that should be financially supported and purchased so more companies will provide us official avenues to play their games digitally.
"Defenetly worth buying, but note - IT IS NOT A GAME  This is a physics engine, and a fun one - the games you can find on the Workshop  Get some friends (or stangers in the multiplayer-browser) and enjoy a game of... almost any boardgame you can think of!"
"10/10 would join and leave a server, then re-join and re-leave several times just so all my Evolution cards would load again."
"My story: After no luck with the deck building feature of this game i posted saying it was missing, within a few hours the creators contacted me as a reply helping me figure out my stupidity and got it working! Game is solid, staff is solid, would recommend."
"The new lan party alternative, this game is simply brilliant."
"Better with friends, but still lots of fun with strangers. 10/10"
"Awesome game, works even better with workshop."
"I log in to Table Top Sim and see the game 'ZOMBIES'.I enter and see a few people playing.They let me fill the old player that left as green.The others will be reffered by red,blue,white and purple. I had no idea how to play the game.Red and purple where kind enough to explain me the rules for a few mins(Meh,TLDR:use dice to move,attack and move zombies, you got cards to do some magical stuff to help or troll the other players.Get to the choppah to win).  I stumbled apon purple and blue,trying to fend off a zombie horde guarding the same place that we have to get in order the win, The heli pad! I rambo my way through the zombholes.I Use a card than doesn't make you attack any zombie when it gets near you and i decided being the good guy by backing the zombies away from purple and blue..Yet Mr Red uses a card and spawns more Zombies  Right at us(what an A-hole :3) and he made us hate him in the guts that way.  I started to rambo my way to the heli again.killing EVERY single zombie near me.I finaly get to the heli pad.Only 2 more zombies remain.Purple tried to spawn more zombies on my A** with a card,but it didnt work (Thank you rulebook!).Red slowed me with one card and blue pulled me back away with another.Left with only 1 life and half movespeed i get to the pad again.All of the A-holes wish me 'good luck' hoping that i would fail next turn ,but suddenly White comes out of nowhere with a 5 on his dice,uses a card to move away the zombies so me &amp; white win the game.Blue and purple rage along while red Threw the table!   11/10 Would make and break new friendships again."
"It's a simple idea, well implemented."
I can play chess with my friend who lives a million kilometers away :)
Bestest fridays night game. Works great wih beer. opens up potential to gamble online.
Great game couldn't fault not played much but will play more! 
I played chess with a dragon as my king... I have lived a great life
(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ Always nice to wreck kids in some fun board games.
the developer is so cool he replies to the negative reviews and tries to fix the problems the people say.
"Great for playing board games with friends,with modding support its even better.   worth the buy!   "
"I never thought I'd be this excited to play a virtual representation of Chutes and Ladders with a bunch of other grown men from across the world, but here we are."
"This is one of the best games I have ever played. The funniest moments of my life happen during games with my friends. Being away from home, it's a great way to play DnD and other games. I couldn't recommend this game more to people with similar interests. It's worth ever cent."
"My friends and I almost never play board games on Tabletop Sim, mostly we just use it to play our Tabletop RPGs over the Internet (not just D&amp;D), and if you put in some effort, you can make it a really cool experience. My friend GMs a game that is actually more fun in Tabletop Sim than it is playing it in person, because of the way he streamlined it for this game."
"Cards against humanity, ISIS flags, naked Stephen Hawking, dank memes &amp; everyone bulling a 12 year old. IGN 10/10 "
Writing a review because a board game told me too 10/10
"Excellent game, with a million game opportunities coming from the Workshop."
Great!
It is packed full of features but the interface is not easy to use. Anything not included here (besides a better interface) you can download on the workshop. -Pathfinder board? The workshop has it. -GOat fish? The workshop's got you covered. -Eels and Escalators from that one Spongebob episode? Heck yeah the workshop has it!
"It's everything you can do on a board game, on your computer! It has so much potential, but you gotta get friends to play with ya."
What else is there to say? its a great game with alot of workshop content!
"Well, got to play Uno for the first time in my life. ♥♥♥♥ Uno."
Very fun game but not fun alone.
Really enjoying this game. Love that I can in on a game almost any time. Mods and save files are great and allow you to enjoy most any boardgame
"Must Get Game!!! ... this offers a great way to play games that you grew up playing with friends that might not live as close as they used to. Board games, dice games, RPG, MTG, card games, and you can create games with ease. Fantastic idea, and another example that easier can be better."
"Slightly confusing, but it has the potential to be incredibly fun. I generally just play chess and use the deck of cards, but it has a ton of other functions which seem great."
It's great; now I can play Guess Who? all I want without having to spend $40 or look anyone in the eye.
"The authors have made a lot of improvements to the game playing experience without such an excessive focus on physics, including semi-locking board components and the addition of magnet points. Additionally, creating custom content (boards, pieces, decks, and even 3D models) is exceptionally easy, making for a tool that is a superb engine for remote gaming. Authors actively supporting this product, and I expect to see that support improve as we get closer to the release of a competing product (Tabletopia) in coming months. Highly recommended."
My friend and I couldnt make it through one game of chess without flinging the pieces everywhere
"Buy It,Play With Friends,RAGE QUIT BY FLIPPING THE TABBLE LOL."
"Infinite possibilities but unless you're looking at solitaire, you'll need a few friends or to join a hub to organize some games."
&gt;entered a game &gt;someone had an ipad or some ♥♥♥♥ &gt;there was dog porn on it  10/10 fml can never unsee
This is a great MTG online alternative same for Pokemon or yugioh.You just need friends to sum this up!
Was playing cards against humanity on a pub server. Someone drew a huge ♥♥♥♥ on the entire table. 10/10 will play again.
If you can actually find some friends that aren't going to flip the god damn ♥♥♥♥ing table then it's a pretty solid game.
"A board game, in this game, told me to write this... No regrets"
Don't want to clutter your closet with board games you'll probably never play for a long time? Don't want to spend more than $20 on those board games ever again? Then this is the perfect game for you!
Fun game with loads of mods. SUPER FUN!
Fantastic game! Great fun with seemingly infinite possibilities!
pokemon tcg drinking games AND fallout monopoly?!  table flip simulator 2016 9/10 tempted by good times.
"This game is really fun and the mods just make the possibilities endless. If you have some friends that you want to play board games with, Tabletop is the game for you!"
I've purchased far too many of these to play this with friends.  Mods are what makes this game. If you browse through the workshop if you're not sure about getting this game you will find that the content is near endless  Servers can be slow and I've had a few crashes but they have been rare but the game autosaves frequently and the time saved by easily shuffling and game set up makes up for it in my mind.
Best simulator games i have fun to play with friends and family!
"&gt;be me &gt;always clears cookies, clears history, and often goes on incognito &gt;wife asks me why I do such things &gt;starts to sweat immensely  &gt;tries to find a way around it &gt;discovers Tabletop Simulator &gt;finds an in-game tablet where you can do whatever you want on the Internet &lt;beats game single-handley 11/10 doesn't have to worry about wife no more."
great game putting a review in game i r8 8/8
Awesome. Buy a four pack its that good
was forced to elave a rating
"fun game, can do and play any game you can think of."
Provides good clean fun.
Hosted server  True friends joined  Made our shrek jigsaw puzzle dream a reality  11/10 would get shrekt by a puzzle again
"Bought this game, thinking it would be really cool to play with friends.  None of my friends were online.  Joined random yu-gi-oh server.  Complainted about the controllers being hard.  Flipped the table out of anger.  I became friends with a random and deceided to play on ygopro.  10/10 would flip again "
Fun game! Could flip the table whole time 10/10
Just like Mr Kipling and his exceedingly good cakes this is an exceedingly good game!  Just buy it so you can relive all those table flipping moments of your life.
FLIP THE TABLE!!!!!
"Tabletop Simulator is a fantastic way to playtest board games that you may be tempted to buy, good for playing with friends who don't live in your area anymore, or simply when others aren't available at the time. Another possibility would be to have people gather round the monitor and play a game together in the same room when they don't own a copy of a game. I bet it would work wonderfully with the steam console hooked up to a TV.  Going onto the steam workshop allows you to look for games that you can load into tabletop simulator. If you can't find what you're looking for, maybe you can find someone who uploads games. Or maybe you have a way to create the game and upload it to the workshop.  It also has many old favorites like checkers, chess, connect 4, battleship, clue, monopoly, various card games, etc."
"This game is great. Although i met with some difficulties starting the game, the developers quickly taught me what to do and that immediately solved the problem. If you are experiencing tutorial problems, you can try uninstalling VC++ 2010 redist and install again. 游戏不错，虽然在做新手教程是遇到一些问题，比如没有桌子什么的，但是开发者很快的就回复我，告诉我如何解决，如果你也存在新手教程没有桌子的问题，可以尝试重装VC++ 2010 ."
Pretty good simulator. Its open-endedness means you'll get a lot of bang for your buck.
Great game that only keeps getting better with improvments to loading speed and game physics.
"Joined a random server. Drew satanic symbols and ♥♥♥♥♥' on the board. The host asked, 'so do you know how to play pente?' 'No,' I responded Came out after 10 games, knowing how to play pente. 11/10 will learn random board games again."
great fun with random people or with friends.
"Reasons why this is one of the best games in my library:  1.) You spend $20 and you can play almost any board game or card game you can think of. Compare that to paying $10-$20 for a physical version of every board game. 2.) Literally every PC can run this game, so all your friends can play with you, even if they (or yourself) have a ♥♥♥♥ PC. 3.) The game is so thought out its crazy. Almost every feature you need is there. Need to deal a whole deck of cards to 5 people? Just right click and it will deal them equally to all players. That's just one example. 4.) Workshop intergration means that the fun never ends. 5.) It's just down right fun.  Please buy this with a couple of friends. I swear you'll have an amazing time."
"Bought it today in holiday sale. So on my first day with this game I met to guys, stayed with them in a game for more than an hour and only in the last 15 minutes really played a game(Exploding Kittens). The other time we were writing and showing us things on an virtual tablet. Best game ever. &lt;3"
Great game!!! dont buy it unless u know pepole that have it though
6.5/10 
Twomd tried to flip the table! But was too weak...
"Love this game, i'm literally flipping tables everytime i want to reset and load in more games."
"I be like: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ Then GM be like: ┬─┬ノ( º _ ºノ) But the i be like: (╯°Д°）╯︵/(.□ . \) After that i be like: (╯°Д°）╯︵ ┻━┻ But the table be like: ノ┬─┬ノ ︵ ( \o°o)\ However, after that i be like ┻━┻ ︵ヽ(`Д´)ﾉ︵﻿ ┻━┻ And then i actually played the game.  ┬─┬ /10"
This.
"Ohhh so missed boardgames, now avail to play with your friends over a distance... a hail the Tabletop Simulaor developers and those who add games !!!!"
You can flip the table
Checkers with a small hint of ♥♥♥♥ THIS TABLE
"I asked in global chat if anyone was teaching games, and people are more than willing to make a room to teach you. Been having a lot of fun. I got this copy as a gift and I bought my friend a four pack to distribute to more of our friends. Makes me want to buy more boardgames, Ha!"
"Truly amazing! Long story short, I tried the game and some 40 hours later I had bought 2 more copies to gift away...and now I came for the 3th!... 4 pack deal starts to make sense to me now xD  10/10 definitely worth full price!   *Tablet included*  "
"Do you enjoy tabletop games?  Do you have friends who enjoy tabletop games? Do you have $20 to spend? $10 during sales?   If you answered yes to the above questions, Tabletop Simulator is a slightly buggy solution to your problems! Most of the time any bugs encountered are with the mods that some other people make, but rewinding time is easy and works to fix it for most people. If it doesn't, throw whatever it is off the table and it'll fix itself.   10/10 I love tabletop games.  Secret Hitler is the best."
Rather friendly comunnity full of people who are nerds and like board games alike...
A friend and I played chess like gentalman for 30 minutes and I won... My friend flipped the table after.
Absolutely the best way to play board games online.
People have waxed lyrical about this game. The facts:  Community is one of the nicest around (over all)  The global chat is helpful and moderated which means its civil and not unpleasant to be in.  The current selection of games is amazing  If you like board games and want to find some awesome ones you may have missed along with people to play with?  Go get it.
"Great game, Very calming to play with some close friends. I suggest having friends beforehand."
Lag your game of UNO with your friends by spawning 100 tree-ents.  10/10 friends not included
Great game
10/10 would spent 3 hours making a 15 minute long dungeon again.
"If you want a review of this game to follow, you might want to take one from someone who has over a thousand hours in this game. I absolutely love this game. You can play anything that goes on the table if you're dedicated to doing so. Everything from Magic the Gathering to Betrayal at the House on the Hill. Anything is possible. And don't worry about friends not being on the game with you. There's an in-game server browser to help you find what you want to play.  For those who can't port forward to host their own server, there's a proxy network set up for you to host without having to port forward. It increases lag a little but it definitely helps with ease of access. Have fun and I hope to see you ingame! "
The title says it all and there are some great community made game sets out there for almost any board/tabletop game.
This is literally the best possible way I've found to simulate a tabletop! Love it!
Shameless achievement
"This game is fun and great! Don't let my tiny play time fool you! Also, im writing this review from the in-game tablet. flip/10"
"&gt;Playing UNO with strangers since I don't even have friends. &gt;Things start of fine, everyone putting down some fair cards. &gt;Stuff is picking up now, we are all on a small amount of cards &gt;This is when everyone uses there +4, Skip and other cards. &gt;Want to end myself  10/10 would destroy non existant friendships again. "
"Wroth with frustration after the foetid pile of nearly-as-intuitive-as-Dwarf-Fortress interface hell that is VASSAL, some friends and I sprung for a four-pack of Table Top Simulator. It does exactly what it says on the tin: provides a passable virtual tabletop for implementing board games. There are myriad implemtations in the Workshop, and the game appears to be relatively straightforward to build your own in, which is great.  While the interface is mostly intuitive, there is certainly some cantankerousness - even jankiness - in the physics, but absent being able to drag several meatbags around an actual table, this combined with your VoIP application of choice makes for a perfectly acceptable analog.  More options for (as an example) zooming in and out while you are moving an object would be welcome.  (I did not try the in-game VoIP, which is present)."
Janky as all hell and a terrible way to experience games but also a laugh riot with tons of customizability.
"If you ever were like, 'I want to play that one Pokemon board game from the early 2000s' then you can if you buy this game. 8/3.1415926535"
Now I don't have to spend my money on real boardgames! (being able to flip the table was my only reason to buying this game)
Best game for finding things to do
"I picked this game up after a youtuber and omg its so freaking fun. Yeah I'm an idiot for buying the 4 pack bit my friends can play with me too now. So fricking fun to play this with your friends. This is a must have if u love to get with your buds and chill. And the workshop it makes it a ton better made up games, classics its amazing. It looks really good too. Also flip that table in rage"
"I quite like this game, Its a good way to play any board games you want without leaveing your computer chair, But if you're not interested in board games, Or don't have any freinds to play them with, This game might not be fore you."
""
"Graphis is as beautiful as you wanna be, it all depends on the object and pictures the modders upload into it. Steamworks features makes the games last for decades. You can save a lot of money, and even time. You don't need to be worry of missing the items. Just copy and paste it. You can even write code in LUA for the game to work the way you want it. And last but not least, you can even make your own game from it.  Don't forget, There will be Virtual Reality support, and multiplayer is going on very good now.  It's a MUST for board game fans."
this game is the best one for 20 bucks everyone should get it. money well spent
OMG if you ever played board games as a kid grab this and go ape nuts on the workshop a lot of folks have made a game or games you probably have played a must have 8 out of 10 all the way through this run on sentence yea yea boy lol
"I seriously doubted buying this, within 10 minutes it showed me that it has depth unimaginable. bought it for 10 bucks during sale, $20 is kinda steep considering the audience that is growing from it, but regardless it is a highly polished highly moddable game."
one step forward of vr world possibility
"The childhood memories of families parting ways because of a game of monopoly can now be done all over again!  But this time, online!  Lovely game, but a lot of the content is depending on the community. Luckily, steam has one of the best communities ever! There are few limits to what kind of boardgames you can play with this simulator!  The main downside: You need friends to have proper fun with this game... ;P"
Worth it -- if you have a friend with somewhat of an attention span.
This game is great to play with friends on. If only i had them. 
The only simulator game that is actually worth your money! this game is actually FUN to play and does not waste your money like other simulators
"One of the BEST games on Steam. I'm not even kidding.   You can play literally any tabletop game you can think of. From games like Cards Against Humanity, Pokemon TCG, Yugioh, to Munchkin, Warhammer, D&amp;D, and many more.  10/10"
Does not come with friends DLC.
because there is no way in hell i was gonna miss out on an in-game tablet that uses the internet like the phone right beside you.
"Many people say that Tabletop Simulator is a waste of time and money.. However, I say otherwise.   I really love this game simply because of it's relaxing games, music, and overall content  You can play classic table games offline, or onile with friends.  You can also CREATE YOUR OWN custom game, and share it on the Steam Workshop!  The only flaw I have to say about this game is it's MAC support.  I am a MAC user, and sometimes when I launch the game, it freezes as it is introducing Berserk Games. This does not happen very often, but I would greatly appriciate it if they fixed it. :)   8.5/10 Very Good Game!  Thank you for your time and reading this review! :)  -UberTheScouts"
Just get a couple of freinds and a mic and you're good to go.
Great if you love boardgames.
"Pros: -Pay $20 to get a ♥♥♥♥ ton of tabletop games that would otherwise leave you heavily out-of-pocket. -No cleanup -Play tabeltop games with people you otherwise wouldn't -Good for playtesting board games you want to buy, but aren't quite sure about -Good for RPGs, like D&amp;D, Cyberpunk 2020 -Good for miniatures games that cost a ♥♥♥♥ton, like Warhammer, or that Star Wars X-Wing game. Cons: -No sweet box to salivate over -No sweet box content to fiddle with -Not nearly as satisfying as playing the real thing, with the cards in your hand, moving the pieces yourself, that smug look on your face as you play that card/move that piece that is going to completely ♥♥♥♥ your opponent over  I'll recommend this game, though I would purchase it for less, if possible, maybe $15."
its great! all boardgames in 1
The only game where I can get away with scream 'I am not hitler'
Flipped a table.  10/10
"An amazing platform for not only playing board &amp; card games, but also creating simple physics base games such as minigolf and carrows."
"If you are a board game fan, literally anything. get this. It has saved me so much money."
Best game i had ever played. I write this message via Tabletop!
watch out there is a wild qq master on this game.
This is one of the best values out there. So many great game mods. Tons of quality content and hours of enjoyment. If you don't have friends there seems to be a large community around this. I Highly Recommend This!
This is an amazing game - still a few bugs but am having hours and hours of fun with it. And on top of that meeting a lot of great folks and making friends. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys board and card games whether single player or with a group!
"Amazing game, I created a rpg with my friends that we have been having a load of fun. I wouldn't have been able to design it and have so much fun over the time that we have done so. Not to mention have played ones made by others."
If you like tabletop games this is a must have.  Tons of workshop content to keep you entertained. :)
Tabletop simulator!  Now featuring secret hitler!  What? you wanted more games!? HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA funny joke
"If you want to play any board game you can think of, online with friends, this is the game for you!"
This is the kind of game you get when you've got a ton of friends across the world and want to treat them to a proper Tabbletop RPG experience. Sure it costs a bit of money but all you need to do is tell them all the board games they can play and Berserk Games suddenly gets a new purchase.
"Some very nice ports of boardgames and cardgames on the workshop, as well as many interesting other things like the animated rpg pieces. I recomend."
a ♥♥♥♥ing awsome game!!!! JUST DO IT YEAH YOU CAN!!!!!!!!!!! its a really awsome game. i love it &lt;3
"Definitely worth it to have copies for all your friends too.  Every board game you want to play, probably available on Tabletop Simulator."
Good base game with so many mods its ridiculus :)
""
Tabletop Simulator is the only simulator where you can let your aggression out by flipping the table!
"This is the game that Steam Workshop is made for. The community surrounding this game is absolutely amazing and it is rare to find a game that hasn't been ported into this format. Some work better than others (Timed games like Escape are a bit difficult without getting very familiar with the control system), but overall the quality of what's out there is very very solid. I did have a tough time getting used to the controls at first, but they become intuitive after a bit of practice. I would recommend watching a video of a game first before attempting to play it in here, I think it makes it easier to pick up personally. My recommendations are Secret Hitler (or Palpatine) and DungeonQuest (A personal favorite of mine outside of the simulator, somehow made easier to play virtually). This game is worth the purchase, even at full price."
"I would very much appreciate the support of a 3D mouse, such as 3DConnexion's SpaceNavigator. Other than that, a brilliantly, unmatched concept. Well done."
"One of those games that's just good to have. Good to play with friends, out of boredom, or on a road-trip."
"It's a bit daunting at first to learn, but once you get the feel for it, it's so much fun to play! I play with my friend who moved across the country, and we can still enjoy our game nights, and recently have been trying DnD. Definitely the kind of thing I'd buy for all my friends to play, as long as they don't mind learning how to navigate the controls with ease!"
"  Really like the versatility of this game. There are so many mods for games that I would otherwise have dish out hundreds of dollars for. I now have access to every magic card out there and have become a pokemon master. Anyways I have a group that used to do game nights every couple of weeks, so it pays for it self. Don't get this game if you have no friends."
"-Play some Texas hold'em with your friend -You have good cards and look likes your friend has too -You go all in, so does your friend -Both of us shows your cards -It seems that i won -I try to take the pot -Friend flips the table and says im using aimbot  This game is pretty funny. You can get few hours of fun from it"
"A really great simulator, like all things it's more fun with friends but it's still playable solo with a very good community and constant public games, also make sure to take a look at the workshop games especially Secret Hitler.  11/10 would frame friends as Hitler again"
Literally every card and board game you could ever possibly imagine in one game.  Is it worth $20? Hell ya it is.
"Absolutely amazing game. Great community, and great tabletop games."
hey that's pretty good
"Do you love boardgames?  If you answered yes, you want this game.  If you answered no, what is wrong with you?"
I kick ♥♥♥ at Uno XDD but suck at everything else!
"Good game if you have alot of online friends, the public servers are horrible."
"Takes some time to find groups of people, who play more complicated games, but there are plenty open servers for simple games at all times."
It's ok
I spent 6 hrs doing an online jigsaw!!  A bit annoying to control to start with. But once thats sorted out you could spend hours playing pretty much any boardgame ever made for as long as you like with anyone else who happens to have this game.  I enjoy this game and ao i recommend it.
peopl constantly flipping table 110/7.3
"  One of my Friends gifted me this product, he later refunded it.     I payed him back, but we are no longer friends."
I like the set up to this game. It is almost like being with people. You have creative tools you can use to make your game play more easy. There are other games you can purchase to play as well as make up your own games to play. It was a lot of fun!
"Works great! It allows you to play pretty much any board game digitally. If you like the convience of not having to set up the game and cleaning it up afterwards, this is for you!"
10/10
"Must own game, now it is even better on the Vive! It is a must have!"
Flip the table because you know you would not do it in a real life game of monopoly
"Get this game....... Only if you have friends to play it with though. This game is super fun, but like an actual board game you need more than yourself to play it. Don't let that from stop you from getting it for yourself and a few of your good friends cause you will have a blast playing this."
This. Is. Just. Awesome.  You like card games? Buy it. You like board games? Buy it. You can't play with your friends because of distance or your wife won't let you? Buy it. Just buy it ffs!  11/10 my wife thinks I'm just reading internet while playing Legendary Encounters Aliens.
"This is amazing, you must buy it! Endless hours of fun, playing all kinds of boardgames."
"It's pretty much what it says on the tin. The default games it comes with are fairly standard but there's lots of quality DLC for cheaper than you could get the same games physically and there are also plenty of great free mods if you're looking for a specific obscure game or just some variety. It lets you do a lot in-game and it's all fairly intuitive. Get this if there are tabletop games you want to play but it's hard to get everbody you want to play them with in the same place at the same time. Just be sure all the friends you want to play with are actually getting it too, and if you just want to play D&amp;D or some other tabletop RPG you're probably better off using Roll20"
"Excellent game for playing with friends in other states/countries. Interface is a bit wonky, but the mod community makes up for it."
"An excellent buy. I would highly recommend this game, even without workshop additions or mods its great fun to play poker, chess, or other games with friends.  Also make sure you have friends."
Bought this to try and play Cards Against Humanity with my friends online. Ended up repeatedly dicking around instead of actually playing CAH.  10/10 would flip the table into the stars    Also VR mode is just... I don't know. I can't think of anything.
TFW You are so lonely you are playing UNO against an A.I.  10/10 Would uno again
"Very well put together and useful program to create your own games and play others! Fun and easy userface, and the multiplayer function is very handy and efficient! Recommend highly!"
A great little resource providing me and my friends a great way to play all our favourite board games across the internet. Supported by one fo the most commited communities on steam.
chess play
"Came for Secret Hitler, stayed for Secret Hitler. But that doesn't mean there isn't a ton of other great board games in this game."
  can't get through one game of eels and escelators without table flipping
"When I was a kid, I usually got several board games for Christmas. They'd usually only be played once or twice before being put on a shelf and ignored until the end of time. I always liked board games, but my family did not. They were just not into that sort of thing, and didn't have time for it. So with no one to play board games with, how would I be able to find others to play with? The answer is Tabletop Simulator.  Now you don't need all those old games taking up room in your closet. You can find most of them in the Steam Workshop for Tabletop Simulator. And you don't need your family to play board games. Now you can play with your Steam friends and other people. You can mess around with physics and drawing. I've actually made a few friends playing this game, and you can too. Sweet. If you like board gaems, then buy Tabletop Simulator during a Steam Sale. Physics are fun. Sauce."
great game and its cool to! i only have one problem once you buy this you wonder why you bought it and then you think: how ccome i have so many board game apps on your phone
"This game is a lot of things. It is fun, nicely done, silly, practical and very social. This game is good in so many ways. Tabletop game creators get to playtest their games before trying to release. People who play a lot of card games can play them online. People who play tabletop games in general can play them anytime with their friends.  Because of the amount of features this game provides, you always have just the features required to play any tabletop game. Heck, it even let a friend and me play some card games we've wanted to try out before buying!"
"I've never been a table-top gamer. Was recently introduced to a few and enjoyed my time. One thing that immediately struck me was the cost of table top gaming can get extreme pretty quick.   My initial skepticism about this game evaporated real quick.  My current opinion is that this might be one of the best gaming values i've ever purchased. If your at all a table top gaming fan, THIS IS FOR YOU!. Take some time, learn it and love it."
ALL THE BOARD GAMES YOU CAN THINK OF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
IT HAS HERO QUEST!
"This is awesome. You can play games over the internet easily, without having to do setup. The only thing holding this back is people creating the content!"
"I would definitely reccomend if you're a fan of tabletop games, especially if you like DnD. You can find a multitude of games, ranging from DND - all the way to secret hitler, and can be pretty fun if you play with a group of friends. Most players are generally non-toxic, and are willing to teach you how to play this game if you're interested.  However, let's be honest, we both know you don't have friends, so you'll be stuck in multiplayer looking for servers that aren't locked  (most servers are password protected) .  Pros: • Most board games are free, and you can get more from the steam workshop • Generally non-toxic community • Finally able to play a game of DND • Many different types of games • You can ♥♥♥♥ing flip the table if you're mad • The tutorial is pretty simple • Built in voice-chat  Cons: • A some-what small list of open servers • Most games take a lot of time • Trolling, although can easily be fixed, still ruins the vibe of a long game • The controls can be a little over-whelming if you're not used to keyboard and mouse gaming • Somewhat rare to be in a full game     SCORE:  9/10  Definitely worth buying in full price if you enjoy tabletop games."
Spent 2 hours trying to build a puzzle with some friends. Best way to waste time 2016.
"So I saw this game a while back and figured I'd look into it.  After looking at all the various games available, I said, 'Meh.'  Secret Hitler? meh. Game of Life? Meh. AD&amp;D? Meh. Cards Against Humanity? Meh. Pokemon TCG? Meh. Heroquest? Meh. Travelers of Catan? Meh. Poker? Meh. Uno? Meh. Blackjack? Meh. X-wing? Meh.  and hell, that's just a tiny smattering of the 'Meh' games this program has.   And then... I saw it. The Mat Everyone Had as a Child. I WAS SOLD! Pushing around a little virtual toy car on a virtual mat whole going 'Vroom Vroom!' and slamming toy cars together while going 'Bgggbgbbggg'? WORTH EVERY PENNY!!"
"I bought this game three days ago, and I have already played it for 20 hours. It is a great game with friends, and maybe, if your loner, alone. Bunnies are still absent, and I am awaiting the modding community to fix this. That's the beauty of this game. If you have a childhood favorite table top game, you can search for it on the steam workshop, and play it with friends. If it's not there, its rather easy to make a mod for it to be there, and you get internet cred. This is a great value for the price if you love tabletop games."
"It's a simulator of tabletops. You get several classic games as base, some newer games as DLC, and some as not-explicitly-legal mods."
Very fun game you can play with your friend and you can have alot of fun...
"This is the one game, where i can essentially get any game for free and play it with complete stragners because not everyone has people to play with IRL, if i want i can even learn new game or see if i like a game i find and purchase it IRL to support the creators and play it at game shops if i wanted"
 Early Access Review
"I enjoy this game very much, got almost all board games i had when i was a kid. The Best Part of the Game is where i just play the game alone and have no friends at all :D"
"For the first few hours, I messed arround in singleplayer and just ooohed and ahhhhhed over the tablet and MP3 which go on the internet and play songs respectively. It was interesting but not really fun. Anyways, then for about a half of an hour I joined a server where nothing was planned. Just a bad idea really, I'd say don't do it. At this point, I was almost convienced that I wasn't going to like this, but then I saw a server in the chatroom that said they were looking for people for Munchkin. I joined the game, and after a few issues we were started. Our first game was good, but a little boring, kind of a warm up. Our 2nd game though, that was intersesting. We had the dungon of manditory murder up for a while, and the shadow nose came up, who has a 0 chance of running away from and makes you loose 3 levels. The player had help and they both were able to beat it. Then I threw in the gummy golem which is only efected by level. they were now at 7 to 15 with no chance for more help and no chance of escape. 10/10 would stay at 1st level for most of the game again to screw people over. Anyways, my point is, this is kinda more fun to actually play the game with odd controls then to mess around with (so far. I only have 7 hours in this game. And juggling dice with R is fun.)"
"Love it! As an indie game dev myself, my team and I have already started to use it for planning sessions and game not as well. It's perfect for prototyping new ideas especially when we can't all be in the same room. Definitely would recommend and have recommended this game to many people. It's simple yet it has infinite possibilities!"
Friends keeps winning at uno and candyland.  Then they beat me to flipping the table :(
has great porn 4/20 IGN
"Incredible value for the money, you make one purchase and you essentially get all the board games you ever wanted in a nice environtment that allows you to customize everything and without the worry of losing pieces, physical damage to the items etc. Great workshop use for this game, thanks to everyone that made and imported various games to it, easy recommendation.  It's like tabletop Gmod  "
"If you have friends who like board games, just buy a four-pack. It's pretty easy to convince them to play. Developers are actively improving the game which is highly appreciable."
The only game where I can put puzzles together with Hentai photos with classical music on with my friends.  1000000000000000000000000000000000 / 10   
 Early Access Review
"Quick:This game is good!  Long:This game is good...and you should buy it!  So why is this game so called 'good'? If you like tabletop games and a couple of friends that to enjoy tabletop this is for you. Everyone has a favorite tabletop game. Be it Risk, Pokemon tcg or even Game of life. What if i told you that these games not only exist to play on workshop but you can play these games with your friends. Now i know that it sound kinda stupid since tabletop games are social games for social interacting, but why should we go to someone else when we can play it from the confort of our own house?"
Downloaded card game  Played card game  Lost card game  Flipped table  10/10 would flip again
"Fun game to play with friends, though honestly it is recommended actually to play with friends as playing singleplayer is basically becoming Noire 2.0  Flip tables, play Monopoly, etc, you can play all kinds of board games here. Even 100% OJ apparently.  If you have friends, definitely recommend this, but if not, it's up to you."
"Great game, tons of fun, great for casual play."
Buy this immediately. You deserve it.
"This game is good at making a board game space, what this is bad at is actually being a tabletop to put your computer. RIP Monitor"
The workshop games are incredible for Tabletop Simulator. Great game selection! I love doing the puzzles too.
"Probably the best simulator game I have ever played, it was worth the $19.99"
"Brilliant, thousands of table top games to play with friends for free, you can't buy this kind of replayability anywhere else."
"This is a must buy if you enjoy board games! I've had a wonderful time playing with friends. I can't wait to try it with the Vive!   If you're the host, be sure to set the Physics to Semi-Locked or Locked to save yourself from dice or figures flying all over the board when somebody rolls the dice."
All the board games. All the time. What more could you want?
-Join a puzzle server. -Start building puzzle -Start leaving random pieces on puzzle - Start throwing pieces all over the board -get kicked  10/10 would get kicked again
The best simulator to help board games and card games live on. Huge thanks to the creators of this simulator.
A must have. Even if you only play basic social games.
"You can play virtually any traditional game ever made on this thing. If you like traditional games at all, get this."
"The included Voice Chat is not great there was a lot of delay and echo, but everything else is fantastic. My worldwide group of friends were able to run this and a g+ hangout to communicate without any issue.   The DLC games are very good and the mods run surprisingly well. Once every has the basics of a game down it's fun to see how fast the games get going. If we were at an actual table we would be getting in each others way bumping elbows and spilling Cheetos everywhere.   Now I can play board games with my friends and not have to share any snacks."
This game has so much going for it and is so much fun. I have played for a good while and have made one game for it. It is an all around fun and interactive experience.
  You can flip the table and you don't need to clean it up  10/10
When I loose I sometimes want to punch my friend in the face.  I guess drawing a huge ♥♥♥♥ on the table will have to do  10/♥♥♥♥ you cain
A game that is amazing with proper workshop support. It has it's limits of what it can do but those are few and hard to see with some of the excellent mods people create.
I use this to play d&amp;d and that's about it. It's pretty good though. 10/10 would slay dragon again.
"I bought Tabletop Simulator to test board/card games before buying them. It has worked well to that end.  As of writing, the community seems active, there are a lot of games available and being added, and the game itself is updated regularly as well with more features and better performance.  The physics and controls are intuitive. Some things are more tedious in the game than in real life, but some things are very convenient as well, such as shuffling decks with a quick shake.  The main issue may be in the future instead, since a lot of the community content is very much in a grey area with regard to copyrights. If all the content were to disappear at some point due to copyright, it would take almost all value out of Tabletop Simulator."
Do you love board games but hate your family? Do you like wargaming but hate the people that play it? Do you enjoy card games but do not like old people?  THEN TABLETOP SIMULATOR IS FOR YOU?  Enjoy all the same great games without the real life interactions of the people you despise!
"This game is wonderful. You could spend hours on this from all of the features that come with the game alone. Ranging from a wide variety of built in game modes to a tablet that serves as an in-game browser, it does not leave you wanting more. However, if you happen to want more options for games, the Steam community has provided an abundance of them. Feel like playing MTG but don't want to go through the headache of using the (horrendously coded) MTG 2014 game? No problem. Go onto the steam workshop and get yo ♥♥♥ some magic cards. It's as easy as that. Keeping this in mind, it is possible to play virtually any board/card game that you want through Tabletop Simulator. Go get it."
This is the single best way to play your favourite boardgames with friends from across the globe. And it just keeps getting better! AWESOME JOB BERSERK GAMES!!!
"Got me into tabletop RPGs. Now, I can't get out."
"Pros: Board games! unlimited amount of great board games, bowling, table hockey, bowling, etc! Cons: bad controls, hard to play mechincs and it is hard to play the games.   8/10 would reconmend for board game lovers."
"So I just finished playing a game with some friends, and I have to say this was the best money I've spent on a game ever.   I expected it to be a fined tuned physics emulator taylored to board games, but it has so much more that makes you feel like everyone is sitting at a table together. I slowly unpacked different things to set on the table:  Hey its quiet, OH THERES AN MP3 Player!  Oh wtf, theres a tablet?! And you can look up youtube?! WTF  10/10.  Best social gathering over the internet ever."
I'm playing board/card games with friends thousands of miles away. Plus there are an incredible amount of games in the Workshop. Also the game auto-shuffles and doesn't make me clean up and put stuff back in the box. 10/10
"Moving from the East coast to the West, I wasn't able to play the table top games I used to play with friends and family. Tabletop Simulator allows me to enjoy the games I love with people back home. It's just awesome!"
"Got it on sale, pretty worth considering how troublesome and expensive it is to get board games in real life. I do strongly recommend you get this game with other friends though."
Just about EVERY board and card game you can think of is at your fingertips (even more so if you're using a Vive!). This is a very sandbox-y game but with a lot of potential and a really good online multiplayer community. I HIGHLY reccomend you go try it out!
Such a worthwhile game just for the sheer fact it allows you to play tabletop games at anytimes with anyone. I couldn't recommend it more.
"Loads of derpy, physics based fun. Also a great way to play card games with friends that you can't see IRL."
"A really great idea executed with simple aplomb. There is an astonishing range of games in the workship; classic titles and user created content are uploaded regularly. Play on your own or play online, but watch out for trolls, who can wreak havok in a very short space of time. Password protect your room and you should be fine. So release your inner child today, so they can again fight with your friends because you suspect them to be cheating."
"Playing tabletop games in digital form can be suprisingly immersive (and messy), play with friends highly recommended"
"Gmod level content. Highly reccomend if you don't have friends, a must-have if you do."
Fantastic game. Very useful for a variety of games. Pair it with Discord for optimal gaming.
"What can i say it really is a Nifty little program  Pros:  +Basically any game you can conceive is either here or you CAN make (Dungeons and Dragons, Fluxx, Risk, Betrayal at House on the hill, many TCG's just to name a few of which i have played) + Great for setting atmosphere + The Community is very helpful ( i had two guys stop in the middle of a Warhammer 40K battle and TEACH me how to play just cause i jumpe dinto their room and was looking cause i was curious) + great potential for PnP RPGS + Wonderful amount of custom content on the Workshop +Constnatly being developed and improved the publishers really seem to care abotu delivering somethign great to the community and value input  Cons: - Character Sheets for PnP RPGs can be a little difficult/Messy ( however there is work arounds) - can be rather laggy at times due to if host PC is low end or what not....( not the fault of the program or the crators however)   Overall Rating 8/10"
Best Way to play MTG so far!
"I can draw on the furnature with markers, just like real life!"
"This game is absolutely amazing. A very accurate engine to play any type of tabletop game you can imagine. The possibilities within this gaming engine is endless. Pros: -Very closely resembles real world physics, with custom physics options (changable gravity) -Provides a platform for almost any tabletop game -Steam workshop greatly increases replayablility -Many functions and features -You can spawn in a ♥♥♥♥ing iPad Cons: -This game will not be very fun if you don't have friends to play it with. This is something inherent to the game though that can't really be solved by the developers so it shouldn't count heavily against them -Some tabletop games are impossible to replicate within the engine such as Jenga. There are alternatives however and the engine can still represent most tabletop games accurately"
"  You'r friend might be living really faaar away from you, but with this, you can still play table games with him!  And other than that, the workshop games are soo fun!  Dou it still has some problems like... little bugs/glitches in the menu but they are not a big problem!"
Do you like board games? Pen and paper games? Friends live too far away? Well here's the answer.
Fun game but the interface is a little weird. This game is good if you ever wanted to play board games but dont have friends in real life so you can go play with people online. jk Im assuming you have freinds but this is a fun game for playing boardgames and cardgames like the good old times with friends from afar. 8/10 would table flip again
"If i could only have one game from steam i would choose Tabletop simulator, This game have opened up a new world for me and made me buy a lot of real boardgames that i have added(created) into Tabletop simulator and playing with friends when we are not able to meet in in real. It is very easy to create your own games and the things that the players are creating and adding to workshop is just amazing."
This game allows you to play any published boardgame or in development. I love how some games are scripted and therefore much faster than the physical version while others are unrestrained and cheating is possible. The voice chat makes the games very interactive and this is a great advantage to other boardgame platforms like Brettspielwelt or boardgamearena. The price is very low compared to the money you will save on physical games. The players are very firendly and willing to teach the games. I give it a 10/10. The only problem is that sometimes players leave in the middle of the games but this is not that common.
"When you purchase this game, you're purchasing 1 game which includes thousand of games.  Totally worth!!"
Really Immersive... Feels like playing face to face!
"This is probably one of the few games which I paid the full price of it when it came out. Usually I buy games only when they are on off sale. And let me tell you people, it's worth every cent. Trust me. This is like my dream come true, since I love board games, especially german ones. "
  fun to flip tables when u lose or win. also fun to draw or play random workshop games. also you can use a tablet in the game for real!. can play a game and watch youtube :) (while in the game) friend gifted me the game.
"Really, really, really good!"
One of the smoothest and greatest sandbox games of all time. very underrated.
Absolutely love using this game.
The only thing really wrong with this game is sometimes the netcode can be bad. But what you can do with this game is nearly limitless and really can play any tabletop game (Sometimes even better due to the scripts that make somethings even easier to handle).  Give it a go.
it was ok
"I mean, the main selling point for me is building jigsaw puzzles out of catgirl hentai. They could have called this thing puzzle simulator and released it with jigsaw puzzle mode only and I would have bought it.  But the additions of waif-uno, Anime Lolicon Monopoly and Go (the chinese tabletop game, not the Pokemon one) really help too."
"4000+ board games? I can play them online with friends or random slobs? Pants optional? YES PLEASE! If you have no friends - play with random people and crush them! Have friends, but perhaps they are in another state/country or maybe just too lazy and dont want to come over to smell your funk? Then this is the title for you! Sure many of the games you want to play will be community projects. Yes the interface and game pieces might be a little on the wonky side. Luckily its board games! You don't need state of the art interactivity and slick interfaces to play board games. They're board games! I can play all the board games of my youth and even most new titles while wearing no pants. Very few people will play board games with me while I am not wear pants, but now they will - and they will never know......  This is a must buy for anyone who has ever loved playing board games. Simple as that."
"OK, let me make one thing clear. IF YOU ARE EVEN CONCIDERING BUYING THIS SIMULATOR, DO SO.  This simulator isn't anything like the ones of the past. This, despite it's very apparent humor, is a fantastic program if you want to play any type of tabletop game with either strangers or friends. I played a single round of Blood Rage, and made two new friends that i look forward to playing with again. Make your own games or enjoy an established game and play along with people in real time. Give this game a try, you won't be dissappointed."
Play any board game you want for just $20
"Love it! Lots of fun, and a great way to play a board game w/ friends online."
"This is pretty much the best video game ever. Note: Tabletop Simulator does not run or officiate the games for you in any way. You draw the cards, roll the dice or go DIRECTLY to Jail without passing Go or collecting $200. Whether or not all fines go under Free Parking to be collected upon landing is your own damned business. Modding games into is just a matter of scanning 2D art or designing 3D objects using your own CAD/CAM software. No programming needed and most games have their (updated/corrected) rules on the web in PDF format."
"This is a pretty excellent tool for playing tabletop games: card games, board games, and role playing games. If you've ever used programs like roll20, it's similar in concept, but much more advanced. It has a huge number of features, and a huge number of mods in the workshop to expand it. I switched over to it after several people from my role playing group moved away, and honestly, other than the more limited social interaction, I prefer it now to actually playing in person. There are a few flaws, or things that could be improved on, but overall it does the job it sets out to do extremely well."
"By far one of the best developers on Steam. Not only is Tabletop Simulator an awesome game. But the developers are constantly improving and refining every aspect of the game. More so than most Early Access developers, even though the game isn't in Early Access.  Highly recommended."
This game is fantastic. It's hard to understand what it is before you play it. It's basically a physics simulation that is specically tuned for board games of all kinds. You can pretty much re-create or play any board game imaginable. I'd highly recommend this if you are at all in to board games.
Spent 20+ hours in this in VR. Must have if you use a Vive
"Pros- Just about everything; Community, Content, Mechanics, Replayibility  Cons- You may experience: friendship, Too much fun, People creating mods before you, and someone who's an ♥♥♥-hole once in a Red Moon(yes not blue, that's how rare)"
It's fun
10/10 best rage simulator after you lose in craps   would flip out again  UPDATE: Forgot to mention don't join a game unless you have some knowledge of the rules or you're with friends. The community can be quite unfriendly. As an example i was banned from a server because I was spectating to learn. So play but with caution
A good game with friends 5/7
Really fun game to mess around with friends.  The variety of the workshop always keeps us entertained.
  it's fun to play uno with strangers
Pros: All the fun of playing real life board games! Cons: Without any friends to play them with.
I liked it but it took it out of my steam inv. and I can't playit again unless I buy it again.
Bought this game to play chess and ♥♥♥♥. Discovered Secret Hitler. I missed my daughter's wedding the other week trying to find out whether player green was a slimy fascist or not. No regrets.
"Mom, dad, I bought a tabletop simulator. Hope you're proud of me."
top-tier tabletop gameplay
This is amazing! Just started playing Pathfinder with my brother. It's amazing how fun just setting up the game can be. Everything about this is fun and amazing and I can't get over it.
"This game is exactly what it looks like, it allows to concievably play any possible table-based game. The controls are easy to manage, and things function as you'd expect them to, although sometimes the objects interact oddly.  Note full enjoyment of the game requires you to use mods, because the base game only has a few games in it. Which is also its strength, since it can essentially have infinite games in its library if you include the mods.   So if you like board games, and want to play them with your online friends, buy this game. And then convince them to buy it aswell."
I love this not game
10/10 best Tabletop Simulator.
Pros: Fun game that simulates tabletop and board games Cons: You need friends :(
great game
"It's pretty dank, man."
The possibilities are endless.
"This game is so much fun with friends. It's a great platform for playing Pictionary, but I'd love to start playing more on here."
"    Marked as recieved for free as I recieved it as a gift from a friend.   Getting straight to the point, Tabletop Simulator is a blast, weather your making your own games using the customization tools, or playing one of the thousands of games on the steam workshop. It's definitly at it's best with friends though! (Candy Land isn't as fun single player...)  If you already have friends who own the game, grab yourself a copy and join in! If you and your friends don't have it, but want it, grab a 4-pack and go nuts!"
"It's a setup which lets you play any tabletop game that people have posted a mod for. The physics engine is a little silly at times, but it works and it's a smooth experience, so it's worth checking out."
Controls are easy to pick up. Creativity is your best friend. You can do almost anything in here! 10/10
"If you've ever wanted to play board games with friends far away, this is how you should do it. Tabletop Sim has loads of pre-made games and classics, but on top of that the workshop games are what give it flavor. There are already so many player-made favorites like Secret Hitler and others, and many people have decided to create classics like Monopoly and LIFE from workshop items.  Tabletop sim is perfect for any board game/tabletop junkie, and on top of that you can voice chat with other players! Most I have met are polite and happy to teach the rules for games you might not know how to play.  You can also browse Youtube while in a game, or look up game rules on a website that you can't put down on a notepad."
they have eels and esculators 10/10
"Playing UNO with randoms from USA, Get to my last card, Host flips table *Disconnected from sever* 10/10"
"I'm having fun teaching people how to play Pokemon and Yugioh TCGs using this.  The controls feel a little weird, but hey, it'll get there eventually.  Fun game, more fun with friends. People online can be trolls, so lock up your games, don't let them move tables without your permission."
Looked up P0rn on the tablet on a server and showed everybody some sic vids. 10/10
Awesome for those that game but can not commute.
This game is very fun if trolls arn't in your game.
"Really Cool if you like board games it's an absolute must. Its a simulator of many card and board games. So you can cheat or trade or even flip the table just like in real life. There are the games rules but only you and the people you play with hold you to them just like real life. That aspect keeps the community friendly and mature strongly recommended especially with the amazing workshop support. Only downside is just like all board games there is still set up time and waiting for players, and teaching the rules. So you have to be ready to commit time to playing a board game."
"It's a very fun little platform to play virtual board games that I just want to play with more and more of my friends, that being said I will complain that since I own the game I can't purchase the 4-pack as a gift, which kindof sucks since I want to play with as many of my friends for as cheeply as possible and getting that extra friend for free would have helped me with gift planning."
"This game is superlative. You can play essentially any board game that anyone's uploaded to steam workshop (i.e, just about every board game ever), and with the Unity 5 update it can actually handle all the pieces without slowing to a crawl. If you like playing board games, you should buy this- it is the board game experience digitalized perfectly."
"Basically, you pay $20 and you get to play every Board/Card/Tabletop game ever made, and then some.  (Check out the workshop)"
"if your friends are scattered across the country, or can't always get together this is the program for you. make almost anything, play almost anything, plus there is a fairly large community of game players on Steam to game with and share ideas,"
you ever sit in a skype call with your friend at like 3am and are like 'wtf do we even do im so bored' then you end up playing this game for 7 thousand hours. literally infinite amount of fun
"What this is, when you get right down to it, is a physics engine for realistically playing various games. From there, the community has made this basically every tabletop game. This is best played with several friends or family members. It'd probably be best to buy as a 4-pack and give out the extras to people you'd like to play with.  The wife and I use this to play Clue even though we live in the same house and actually own a physical copy of Clue. Why? Cleanup is just closing the game, and the cat can't swat about the pieces.  I cannot advise this enough for anyone who just wants something light and low-stress to do while chatting with friends an/or family. It's worth it at full price, and doubly so on sale."
"All your favourite tabletop games in one game.  And if it doesn't exist here, why not create it?"
Bought it because its not in early access.
"Play Magic: The Gathering for $20 instead of $2,000."
Gave me cold war flashbacks
"♥♥♥♥ing great game, I only have 1.3 hours on it but it's such a great game to play with friends or randoms. BUY IT."
"I love this game, but it is not my kind of game. I recommend it to everyone though!"
0/10 does not feature Wil Wheaton
Excellent if I can just figure out how to play most of the games! :)
"When you're too far from your friends to play board games in real life, you play board games with them in a video game 8/8 m8 would flip the table again"
it's amazing all i have to say
this is a really good game 
Only got this recently and all I can say is that I wish that I had got this sooner. I play these sort of games quite a lot but it is not always possible to get everyone in the same location and this really helps. I couldn't believe the range of games that are availiable to play and I have really enjoyed it so far.
"Play many games, with far away friends.  It does its job very well.  Controls are a little unintuitive, sometimes."
Very Addictive
"Really great, probably one of my best buys. Base game is okay but the community content makes it incredible. I can play D&amp;D With freinds online now which is more convenient. And only in Tabletop simulator can you play a game of LIFE with Furry Cards and laugh at the disgusting cards you draw at every pay day. The main reason to buy is if you want to play board games or card games with friends but a second reason is some of the cringe content you and your friends can have fun with on the workshop."
get people mad for flipping their table simulator
"If you have friends, buy it! If you don't, make a few and then buy it.   PS.: Remember to lock the fliptable feature, given the opportunity people will use it.   "
Play board games without social interaction and the obligation to follow rules.
Lots of questionably copyright fun.  Requires a halfway decent computer for some reason.
SO. MUCH. VALUE. buy this game.
  You can play any bord game you want just get it.
"(I spent a lot of time playing offline because of weird library sharing rules, so i have &gt;20 hours but Steam doesnt show them) &gt;This should be a fun game &gt;Playing some card games is pretty neat &gt;cool some neat board games &gt;Wait... &gt;is that...? &gt;play Magic the Gathering &gt;lose every match &gt;draw on the board (you won't beat these MTG masters anyway) &gt;realize I lost again &gt;flip the table &gt;get kicked &gt;it's been 5 hours &gt;walk out into the sunrise as you realize this game is now your life &gt;walk back in, it's too bright out there and there is more mountain dew inside &gt;play 7,698 games of Fluxx in your underpants  I can't stop, please send help"
"This game is pretty fun. It's a well made game so you can play card game with your online friends, it works well, and is even better with VR. Ontop of that the steam workshop offers even more possible games you can play. The price also makes it pretty good. Worth buying"
You can be a tabletop.
Gave starving African children elf ♥♥♥ while playing Cards Against Humanity.  10/10
"This is probably the best money you can spend on a single game for quality playtime returned. Just need more board game companie to hop in and release official content. Bought Superfight, plan to buy Zombiecide, would like to buy more."
"Best with friends, but I've had more than a few enjoyable pickup games with strangers. Active devs add interesting features all the time."
"Tabletop Simulator (TTS) is going down as best game find of the year for me without a doubt. It allows for the play of pretty much any game you would play on a flat surface, regardless of format. Cards, Board Games, Dice, Roleplaying, Wargaming, Bar Games, and more still I'm not thinking of presently I'm sure.  Steam Workshop support is amazing as well. Pretty much any game you can name has already been recreated as a mod and published for free via the workshop. I've played many an obscure game in my lifetime, and have been pleasantly surprised to find most fo them already available to play.  Those couple rare games that I could not find, I've set to work on recreating, which is another point at which TTS excels. The tools it provides to quickly build your own games are very easy to use. If you can provide scans of cards and boards for a game you'd like to create, you can make your own games in a matter of minutes. If your game requires pawns, tokens, or other physical components, I've had very good results downloading 3D models to represent these items from websites devoted to sharing models for 3D printing. This allows you to recreate a favorite game you could not find on your own, or easily prototype and play games of your own design.   Additionally, there is a scripting interface that can optionally be tapped by users with some programming experience. This allows things like automatically drawing a card at he beginning of your turn or moving your pawn forward the number of spaces rolled on the dice. While this can add a nice touch to a game it should not scare non-programmers away from designing their own content... how many games have you played on your dining room table where the pieces have moved themselves around the board or the deck shuffled itself at the beginning of the game?"
"Access to any table game ever: $20 A single table game irl: $10~$80  The community for this game is very supportive of new players thanks to the fact it's mainly honor rules; now lets say a troll joins and breaks said honor rules, two words: rewind button.  Steam workshop and easy to use custom assets also allows for infinite replayability.  Highly recommend getting it for friends to play with on sales.  Note: Learn 100% how to play each game else to risk making a fool of yourself in one of the more complex/hidden-hands games"
Being able to play many different boardgames (including some I've never heard of) is what makes Tabletop Simulator a good program. Being able to flip the table is also fairly funny.
This review was done from an ingame tablet...no seriously this game is amazing.
very good game you should buy very good better than the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise no joke no meme get it very nice game +++++rep
I cannot connect to any game via multiplayer! Direct games either. This is why I purchased this game (that looked amazing by the way). And now I can't enjoy it on mulitplayer. Someone said to port forward my router but that seems absurd seeing that I play every other game online (with mic enabled) without any issues. Such a shame! (Update) The game still has a few connection issues but it's way better. I thouroughly enjoy it now.
"I'd give this game a solid 10/10 but unfortunately their built-in jigsaw puzzle game-mode doesn't support 16:9 resolution images without contorting them, therefore I'm giving it a 7/10. It has potential, but not quite there yet.   When in the future they update said game-mode, I can easily see myself giving it a perfect score."
The killer app for VR we've all been waiting for. The VR improvements lately have really been great and have made this one of the key apps that has convinced my remote tabletop friends to buy into VR. It's great to see a developer and kickstarted project actually be more than what it originally promised.
"When this first came out I was excited and got a 4 pack hoping it would be a way to play games with my friends. I was extremely disappointed. Now a few months later they have updated the game and the workshop is loaded with content. It's almost what I want it to be. And close enough to be useful most of the time.   I have purchased a few DLC's and they seem to be quality with things organized fairly well for quick start. Many very good imports on the Workshop that are either well setup or at least have the components that a little time and effort can get things to a place where you can save it and quickly start the game when you are ready. Some of my favorite board games take a lot of time to setup and play and with this I can not only play with friends around the world but I can have the games setup before we play (saving lots of time) save the games when we are ready to take a break (giving the ability to play the longer games) and don't have to worry about losing pieces, bumping the board, and other crazy things.  That said the system is based on a very elaborate physics engine and at times I wish you could just turn it off. You pick up a card with pieces on it and they move a little (I can deal with that) then you try and put the card down and the pieces on it go flying (not so easy to deal with). It can take a lot of time and effort to set up some games so pieces don't fly when they shouldn't. If they can fix that issue this will be even better and easier to use. But it's still very good and if you want a way to play board games online this is a very good way to do it.  NOTE: I have not see anyone use the lua scripting to automate the board games. There are no rules checking scripts I have seen and the games you play here are not like playing a digital version of a board game. This is a tabletop VR simulator. You pick up the pieces and put them where you want just like in real life. It's up to you and the people who are playing with you to stop cheating or breaking rules."
Now I can make up for all the time I didn't have friends to play boardgames with. With friends hundreds of miles away. 10/10
I get to build Nicholas Cage puzzles. 10/10
"I've played this game a ton before they added VR support and loved it. Play any tabletop game you can think of with friends or strangers on the internet, a ton of options for mods and easy controls for handling the game pieces, a surprisingly big community that's always online and willing to game. I'd recommend this to anyone who's played board games IRL and liked it.  The VR support they've added is absolutely phenomenal, it feels almost bad getting it for free on top of the base game. Shrink yourself to the size of a pawn and run around a table full of minifigs that tower over you like animated statues? Yep. Rotate and reposition yourself and the table so that it perfectly lines up with your couch IRL and you can sit and play games for a few hours with friends? That too. Almost all of the 2D UI is in VR by now and they're still adding updates all the time. Want to play in VR with your friends who only have it for flatscreen monitors? That's fine too, and if they want to drop a gigantic dragon behind you and give you a jump scare, they can. 10/10 would buy again."
"It's a nice game to play from time to time. It's really relaxing and there are a ton of different games you can play, including all card games, (poker, blackjack, etc) secret hitler, codewords, and more. I enjoy this game, and it's fun with friends. Buy it on a sale if you can, but it's still worth full price."
具有意义的桌游平台，把玩家从财力精力体力人力的枷锁中解脱。 A platform which free players from the limitation of time/ money/spaces/energy/distance.
"Great game if you want to play some classic board games with other people online, find some new card games or board games that you have never seen before, or even just hang out and meet new people. There are so many different games you can get from the workshop and many more being put on each day. Fun with friends and even with random people."
"Infinite fun with infinite fan-made content and assets. Overwhelmingly much that can be done, and I'm excited to try out more than I have time for every time I have a free moment. There's even a really warm and wellcoming online community, available straight through the in game chat, where you can find players and other participants."
"All I can say is it's awesome. Great community. People always willing to teach. Occasional a$$hats, but it's fairly rare."
"Play tabletop games with your friends across the Internet? Genius. Nicely done, cool features, most games work out of the box. Get it."
"this game is great if you want to have alot of fun with your friends, but i dont suggest it if u dont have any"
Amazing way to tabletop with friends
"This isn't much of a game, more of an application.  That doesn't prevent you from doing that, though. There's plenty of games to create, play what's already installed, browse the workshop for more, and there's a lot to customize, mod, and everything.  If you wanna play some UNO or another game with your friends across the country, or the world, this is probably for you!  Oh and you can tableflip. That's important."
"This is probably among my most satisfied steam purchases I've ever made. It's not so much a game as a simulator used to play a bunch of other games. It's basically a physics simulator built around board games, but also has alot of great modding tools, which has resulted in pretty much every board game or card game you've ever played being recreated by fans in a digital format. I don't think it's possible to ever run out of fun stuff to do in this program. Lots of good tools for multiplayer but I've had quite a bit of fun in single player as well. Frankly, my only complaint is that more of my friends aren't already using it."
"Is the perfect game. Endless, physics based fun. You'll play random games for hours with complete strangers. And it'll be hilarious."
"Makes playing board games with friends so much easier on a moments notice. Not much to complain about, I don't stray into public games."
Hello guys.  my name is Stomedy and today I'm gonna review Tabletop Simulator for you guys. It's a very good game and much fun.   
"Ayyyy lmao, I take that back we're stupid. 7/10"
"This game is pretty good. Although I wish Munchkin was on the workshop. Of course that's not the dev's fault at all, so if you like playing board games but either don't own any or can't meet up with people in real life, you should buy this. The menu theme is god awful though."
I can't stop playing this game!!! It's amazing how many games you can play in it!! I've been a fan of boardgames in a long time and this is perfect to try it.  Just convince your friends to buy it and I promise you'll have a great time with it.
Anything you can do with a table can be done with this game. Want to play chess with a friend that lives on the other side of the world? you can do that. Want make your own board game? You can do that. Want to flip a table? That's the best part of the game.
"Fun. Not quite what I expected. There really are no set rules, AI, etc. Both players need to be aware of how to play said game. However, it is a great alternative to actually 'going' to a friends house (especially if they live on the other side of the world). Lots of content from the community and ability to upload your own decks is a huge plus. Great gaming potential."
"A good workshop simulator to creating your own board games or playing traditional games with family or friends who are too far away to play with in person.   I've used this to play a few games of monopoly with out of state friends along with occasionally playing around with the physics built in.   For what this 'game' has been built for, 10/10"
"If you like flipping tables and having tables flipped on you all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time, this the game for you."
It brings me back to my childhood when cards and board games were my sole sources of entertainment.
"10/10 this game is awesome. i think this is my 1st review on a game for steam, but even then it still deserves one. friends are completely optional for this game. i have 13 friends who own it and 0 who actively play it. even then it is either my most or almost my most played game on steam. the possibilities for this are endless... just before typing this up i played with working rc tanks on TTS... RC TANKS with cannons and everything. this game is just amazing..."
"If you like meatspace games, it's very likely you will like this."
great software with plenty of user created content 
if you have no friends then you can play a game of chess with yourself
Great andbox game to play with friends. \ not a single player game tho
Awesome game. You can play almost any imaginable tabletop/card/board game on the market for free. Not sure how any of this is legal but it's the best $10 I've ever spent!
"You get 10 minutes of vegeta vs anime fans. 10/10, anime fans win."
"A decent game, but after the first 10 hours or so, there isn't much replay value."
This game is the ♥♥♥♥
Get an achievement for being to weak. :)
"Excellent in VR! The workshop support is overwhelming. If you're into table top games but have a hard time getting people together, this game is for you. I'd like to see some further optimizations made for the VR side of things but overall a must own in your library."
This is what you need when you have no friends to play board games with.  Life with friends simulator 2015  
"Pros: You can play any tabletop game possible in this game. Cons: There's too many games in this game, I don't know what to play and end up not playing.  Overall, it was pretty cool, aside from the one time this guy kept blasting Linkin Park and Gangnam Style remixes on the iPad."
If you want to play tabletop games with your online friends this is great
"Funnier than irl probably because you get games when you buy it AND you can download more from workshop with no extra cost, you can even make ones yourself!"
Great game! Definitely suggest buying.
"Still pretty jank, but unique in what it accomplishes."
"Sure, you can look at it as a way to play board games with friends who live in different cities, states, or countries. Sure, you have an essentially limitless amount of content and can easily get thousands and thousands of hours of playtime out of the small entry price. Sure, you can practically get your money's worth just goofing around with the physics. Sure, you have the freedom to copy and paste, shrink, grow, and animate any object in the game. Sure, you never have to worry about losing an important token, scratching a card, or breaking the arm on a figurine ever again. Sure, you can create and publish your own board games for thousands of people to play through this open platform.  But most importantly at all, you can shuffle a deck of 150 cards by pointing the mouse at them and pressing R."
"Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Sleek, functional, and has a near endless supply of workshop content to keep my feeble mind occupied. Highly recommended."
"'Play every Board Game, with anyone, with anywhere'   SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY"
"Do you like tabletop/board/war/card gaming?  With tabletop simulator you can play *ANY* CCG(magic the gathering, yugioh!), war game(warhammer!, BLood bowl!, Necromunda!) Or tabletop game pretty much in existance.  If you have *ANY* interest in the above, you need to give this game a try.   "
Fun but laggy and buggy as ♥♥♥♥
"Fantastic piece of simulator software. It's so beneficial to the board games community. Everyone should get one just to play all the free games.  PROS 1. RPG Figurines They really do attack and the figurines act like they get injured.  2. Plethora of Games Any board game that you ever dreamed of can be created in here sans AI.  CONS 1. Difficulty in Searching for Games In the game list, you don't know if a certain game is full. This leads to multiple players joining the room only to find out that the game has already started.   2. DLC Ads I don't want to see another advertisment on the right of my single player screen telling me to buy additonal DLC.   SUGGESTIONS 1. Dungeonmaster Hands Instead of the Tiny Hand Icon  I would like to create a bigger, skinned hand (gnarled and wizened) for the dungeon master to show what he's doing. The tiny hand icon is just silly.  I am thinking of the hand from Dungeon Keeper.  2. RPG Figurines Combat Effects Currently, a dragon can't breathe fire. They just swing their head and bite. I want to see it breathe fire."
An excellent friend making simulator!
"I coveted this game for ages and it was worth every second- Tabletop Simulator is an entire suite of fun for you and friends, and the Workshop offerings for it are insane. Check it out, you won't regret it."
"Probably one of the most innovative games of all time. I would reccomend this to anyone who wants to virtually play board games, card games, tcgs, rpgs, and so much more. Thanks Berserk!"
I specifically bought this for simulating what it is like to have a table.  10/10 for realistic table-flipping rage
"Awesome game, well put together and just plain all the more great with how much sheer content has been published by people willing to provide it in the workshop.   This game is simply great if you even remotely enjoy board games, card games, tabletop pen and paper games (such as DnD, pathfinder, and so on) and even random yelling at your friends for flipping the table 50 too many times after you have had to reset it for the last hour of idiocy at its finest.  But really though, with how well all of this is put together, and the community 'mostly' being pleasant to teach a game never before learned is amazing, and makes it honestly worth the price tag."
For everyone with an intelligence sense of what games they wish to play with their geeky-as-♥♥♥♥ companions.
10/10 wish more people would play this amazing game. The possibilitys are endless with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic game.
Nice game!
"infinity number of games within a game, best value for price"
"I played a board game in VR with 3 other friends; felt nearly the same as playing in person. I'm living in the future!  Such a great way to do game nights when not everyone can be at the same real world location. If you enjoy board games and have a friend or two who you can't easily see in person, I can't recommend this game enough."
the game maade me rate 5 starts
this game is forcing me to leave a positive review and my friends hate me now  10/8 gr8 game
"Thanks god (whatever the god you pray); My friends and I can now play D&amp;D Pathfinder online; I'm an old donjon-master, living far away from most of my group players and all I can say is; everything we need is there; you can customize everything as you want. It can be a pain 2 start a good table the first time; but when you know how this game works, url links and steam workshop are doing magic; for real. Such possibilities; and many other epic games. At my viewpoint, some of the games you can download from the workshop are better than the basic ones (except for poker &amp; blackjack; a classic is a classic!!). For this ridiculous price, you can have 2000 games in 1; haters gonna hate!! ;) It's a lovely game but don't except to play it alone; even cats get borred. We had a nice time; and we're not done yet!!"
"For when you have no real friends to play monopoly, or when you want to have every single board game ever made. Accept no substitutes."
"Tabletop Simulator is one of the best games to play with a group of freinds at a lan party or online. With an endless array of games to dowload from the workshop like Secret Hitler, Cards against humanity, Battleship etc. Do not buy this game if you arent going to have freinds play it with you, It is as dull as a brick if you play this game by yourself. A great addition would be local multiplayer with a second key board or controller. Other than that one flaw its a great game 9/10."
"This game would be wonderful if I had friends to play it with.  Anyways, 10/10."
"A bit clunky for TTRPGs, but for regular board games and card games it works great. Would definitely recommend if you want to play board games but have no friends in real life who are into them."
"A MUST BUY. This is simply awesome. It's basically a physics game, no limit to what you can do or create. If you like classic board and card games get this. the workshop is FILLED with classic games we have all come to know and love. Especially great for playing with people over a great distance."
now i dont have to leave
"  this game. this game is pretty good.  I enterd a random lobby and was emidiutly welcomed by people I've never met. the community is nice, the mods are top quality, the built in games are amazeing, and the interface is simple and easy to use.  also there is a table flip button. 5 stars"
"Awesome game, finally I can play Catan, Carcassonne and more with my friends that are far from me. Worth every penny."
Better than even bear simulator. 17/9
challenge a hour without flip the table with friends   is very hard
This game is awesome with a great community they are currently adding the zombicide dlc the workshop is always updating with people adding awesome mods. It's easy to use with an easy to understand U.I and there isn't a game you can't just jump right into or set one up yourself and play along with friends. Got a great idea for a game make your own with the custom boards and pieces and have the cummunity test it out with you there are always people willing. I highly recommend this game to anyone of any age.
Tabletop Simulator is the Gmod of... well... Tabletops!
The most fun game I've played in VR so far. Wholly recommended for every room-scale VR user.
Fun game to play online board games it's very fun
This game has endless hours of fun. The super awesome and creative community are what makes this game stand out. I would definetly reccomend this game to anyone who loves to play any type of casual game or casino game.
"With possibly the largest workshop support of any game on Steam, TTS is one of the best games for the money across the entire store, even at full price."
"awesome game, its very fun even without friends because its so easy to make friends there!"
Great game especially in VR! But VR needs better controls for common things like drawing 8 cards. It slows the game down for other people.
"The game itself is not as good as the others if you wanna compare it with the ones that cost more than 40$ but you can pretty much play any board game you want.  The game could be boring if no one has a mic or talks. The community of this game is one of the best I have experienced so far, sure there are still trolls but you won't meet them constantly, prob 1 out of 10 games or lower chance.  If you meet the right people, it's like playing board game irl with very fun people. Or just play the damn game IRL."
"Why haven't you all gotten this already? &lt;3 Now I can play boardgames with you even if we are not in the same room, or town, or country! (And yes, the it is possible to turn of the tableflip option! &lt;3)"
"Only played a few hours of it but so far with the workshop support this game is excellent, well worth the price on sale but I would happily pay full price for this, the amount of content this game has to offer is pretty outstanding and would 100% recommend to anyone who enjoys any sort of board game. Or if you just like to flip tables then this game is pretty good at that too (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻"
Spend hours playing fallout monopoly. Then tried playing connect 4 and had a harder time playing that. 10/10.  Only problem I have is that everyone has to have the paid dlc to play it. Tried to play superfight and my friends couldn't load it because they didn't own it.
Awesome game 10/10 have to do this
10/10 find friends who play
Ever wanted to sit down at a table with your internet friends to play some tabletop games but don't have the time or money to actually meet each other IRL? Sucks for you but I guess this game is pretty close to that experience
"Pretty decent. NOTE TO NEW PLAYERS: The game does not come with AI, it is exclusively made to be used with friends. Also, don't go for the DLC, just use Workshop for all your needs. While some things are a tad clunky, like being unable to push around a quarter inside a bowl, the game is entertaining for laughs and even comes with a tablet that has a working browser. While the images aren't completely synced with players, as in one can't scroll to show other players something, it matters little when watching Youtube or doing other activities with friends. A variety of games are provided through Workshop, and can certainly entertain people of all tabletop game types."
great fun with friends.
"Do you like boardgames? This is for you. Tabletop Simulator lets you play any kind of tabletop game you can imagine. Almost every boardgame you want is up for free in Workshop. I've always wanted to play these kinds of games, but I don't have many friends locally to do so. This lets you play everything from Catan to The Star Trek VHS Board Game with friends. AND IT REALLY WORKS!  I got my money's worth from TTS on my first day. Highly recommended."
"Moved far away from your old gaming buddies, but just not satisfied by the confines of most games? Now with Tabletop Sim, you can make their lives hell again by destroying every game they try to play."
This game is amazing. Just removing the set up and travel time to play with a bunch of friends is well worth the money.  The interface is slick and versatile. Endless hours of fun.
"A well designed platform, that allows for creativity and sharing of games. The platform overall, is very clean, and has many different ways to create, or use other peoples content.   Pros: Clean Connectivity Fun Mod supports Custom content 10 person matching TONS of content  Cons: Permissions lacking Player control, weak"
"I played Settlers of Katan for the first time in years. It was really fun, the game was very smooth, it's easy to get used to the controls. Sure, you don't have the feeling of the board and all that, it's true, it's missing. But it's still a great experience, especially if you want to play a game you didn't see in a long time, or if you don't have many board game enthusiastic friends around you (like in my case). :)   A really nifty little game, I definitely don't regret getting it. For its price, it's a steal (and let's not even talk about its Steam Sale price)."
"Ive owned this game for a while but havent gotten into it before. I jumped in to this wanting to play texas holdem and then I got introduced to some tabletop games via other players at first through texas holdem. One of the blackjack tables is very fun with power ups, silly and cool rewards and fun people. Secret hitler is also an interesting table top game, where you have to try and figure out who is a fascist and who is hitler. People will lie and will try to convince you that they are your friend and then stab you in the back if they succeed. I havent had much time with the others, but I think that you can play all table top games in the universe, in this game. With firsthand experience of the fun, and with the knowledge of VR support I can see that this game has a very, very bright present and future. It does not deserve less than 10/10. Its just really really good. And if it doesnt stick at first, give it a go now and again and Im certain you will enjoy it."
"One of the best communities on steam, just got done playing after buying it today during steam summer sale. Spent hours playing a game made by someone in the community, had an amazing time. Also got a whole game of MTG played no issues, amazing game."
Overwhemingly positive game 10/10 would play Pazaak again
"Pretty good, a must buy if you have friends to play it with."
"One of the best games for an organic tabletop experiences. Mature, laid back community. Kind of like GMOD before it was swarmed by kids.  Everything feels weighty and chunky, it's just ♥♥♥♥ing great.   GOTY."
Fantastic game.
"Play this game so you can pretend you actually left your house and did something with your life. That is, if you even have friends to play with in the first place ;)"
"This game is fantastic if you love board games or card games and have some friends with Steam. Playing with buddies on this thing is wonderful, and the selection of mods to demo or play just about any game you can imagine is awesome. The features are robust and interesting, and the ui is not so clunky that it wards of people unfumiliar to the controls. Truly a 'make what you want' kind of game. If you invest the time to set up awesome tables, games, and get some friends to play then you will have a blast."
Infinite games... 10/10
"It`s a nice game, filled with many different board games, both ingame and from the Workshop, I haven`t really tried it out that much, because I lack friends to play it with; but it looks very nice and I`ve seen different streams of the game. Can`t wait to play it with a couple of friends someday! :)"
A game where I could FINALLY be able to play a game of cards that isn't 'Card Against Humanity' online.
I played a simulation of playing a card game about simulating playing a trading card game. Nice.
The tutorial actually scared me.
"Amazing product. Very small learning curve to get custom stuff working, but you can run basicly anything tabletop in this well. physics can be locked on a per object bases. all the tools are wonderfully straightforward. Last thing this game needs is for workshop uploads to upload the assets themselves, and not weblinks to them (note only the host needs to have the workshop mod/game, other players do not need it to play with them)."
This game is great I love creating games of any kind card or table top rpg I very much recommend u get this game
Want to play a board game you haven't played or seen in years? The Steam Workshop probably has it.
"  Before I begin my review, I was gifted this by a friend. That has no impact on my review however.  Tabletop Simulator is exactly what the name implies. It is a great way to play board, card, RPG tabletop, and other types of table games with your friends online. There is no end to what you can play. From Chess, checkers, Uno, Monopoly, party card games, pictionary, and so many others.   The controls are simplistic and easy to understand. There is a short tutorial that will show you how to grab cards, use objects and figures, and roll dice. A mouse and keyboard is all you need. Graphics are also nice, although some different types of games can lag the program a bit. Usually a refresh fixes that though.  Overall, it is well worth the price I believe. Even without the DLC you can find an endless number of games to play with friends. As long as you enjoy tabletop games, you will thoroughly enjoy this one."
"Tabletop Simulator is one of the best games I have ever bought. I love playing board games with friends and family so this appeals a lot to me. You can play practically any board game ever made, for free! Many board games cost $40+ but you only have to pay for this game once, everything else is user-made and free on the workshop. You can play games with only your friends or you can play with strangers too. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that likes to play card games, board games, any type of game really, you can find it on here."
"I have 100+ boardgames IRL and I have bought probably half of them since purchasing Table Top Simulator. I now use it essentially as a way to test a game out for free before I buy it because there are so many available on the workshop. Not sure if there is a copyright issue or not but I will keep trying out games until I can't anymore. As others have said this game will not be as fun unless you have friends who will play with you, and by friends I mean people who can resist trying to flip the table or throwing pieces all over the board all the time.   Be prepared to see a lot of Secret Hitler lobbies in this game is it the most popular one right now."
"One of best steam stuff, I recommend a lot to buy it"
"I do not mind having this game among my collection although I got it recommened/forced to get it and download it. This is a really fun game to play with friends although it still can't beat cards against humainity as the best 'party' game. (Honest opinion, I do not disagree if you think differently). I defenitly consider you to pick this up with your friends because playing it alone is pretty useless and boring. Aside from that this game has seen lots of love from the community and the developpers. You have lots of options what to play, from the simplest game as poker to dungeons and dragons (I think so, not 100% sure but probably), thanks to the people who add to the workshop. There are also many standard option if you do not feel like downloading dozens of mods. Flipping tables is a great feature. I think the only downside is that it is laggy when moving with a lot of objects on the table."
"Very solid, well optimized and kept up to date, Tabletop Simulator addresses the tabletop market like no single game/app can (*cough* Talisman, although it did come out before TTS). A stellar game that I can't recommend enough, it runs on nearly any computer, the controls are simple and have been tried and tested by friends on laptops with integrated graphics and only a built in touch pad and keyboard. What really makes this game is the workshop community; nearly all of your favourite games are made available on the workshop thanks to the unpaid hours of the glorious community. o7 Workshop is also incredibly easy to submit to - simply a matter of editing pre-existing tiles/tokens/boards/whatever and the depth is there for complex moving models for games such as D&amp;D or W40k.  10/10 would recommend, if only for doing jigsaws of anything you want and chilling to Chopin through on YouTube through the in-game tablet."
"After downloading and speeding through the tutorial, I'm sitting at the main menu reading Global chat &amp; I decide to make a mention of UNO considering it was a family favorite growing up and the people who were in Global seemed like genuine company, they immediately respond with, 'Yay UNO, let's do it' etc.. Someone starts a game, Mic required (Host didn't even have a mic) after sitting down the host begins to hand out cards, that gesture is shut down almost instantly by another player yelling 'I'll get my own damn cards'..so I said, I'll take the hand' and they were given to me, that's a good thing because I totally forgot how to pick up the cards to begin with so this gave me more time to look over the controls. we have our cards by this point, the first card is a draw 4 placed by the Host of the game, now if you know about UNO, you know the draw 4 is a sure-fire way to get someone a bit upset. As I prepare to pick up 4 cards, the player on the other side of the host begins to shout 'let's do this ♥♥♥♥, come on guys!' JUST to be sure, I ask (in-voice) what way we are playing, counter-clockwise or clockwise, the impatient player next to the Host replied 'do you even have a ♥♥♥♥ing Mic?' now at this point I'm hella confused and I was just gonna assume they weren't talking to me because wut ..? then the Host Said, 'this way' as he hovers his mouse over the impatient player, the impatient player then says, 'da fuuk NO,' and some, without going into detail he basically made a statement about me being a Homosexual who enjoys performing fellatio on other men, then proceeds to scatter my cards, another player then flipped the table. At this point I'm just kinda looking at my monitor like, y tho. I then read on-screen that I lost connection to host. 9/10 But next time I'll ask the direction BEFORE a card is played."
"You can play board games with friends! The Steam Workshop is brimming with great board games, all you need to do is subscribe and download the content! Pick up a 4 pack on a sale somewhere and send codes to your friends and enjoy!"
"Pretty fun to screw around in with friends, even if you don't end up actually playing a game. If you're looking for a game online with strangers, well... I hope you like Secret Hitler."
Pros:   - You Can Play Banana Cons:   - Not enough people know how to play Banana
"See this being fun with friends, but not with strangers, a lot of them are little dip♥♥♥♥♥ either in the game or if you join their open games in multiplayer mode... Just get the game if you have friends to play with."
"Awesome game to play with friends, the workshop is full with stuff, and you can even mod it yourself, if you know some drawing programs, maybe 3D modelling. :) I recommend it to everyone! :D It's even fun with strangers, if you don't have friends, who play this awesome game. :D Buy it, it's so worth it :P"
Just plain awesome - can't be compared to any other game - it's a must buy!
I've been waiting for something like this for ages now. Being a massive fan of board games I'm eager to see what games get converted to here. Let the DLC's roll out!!!
The best.
A small loan of a million dollars couldnt save me from this game
"Me: *Shows friends D&amp;D kind of game (urealms)* Friends: Cool, Lets play! Me: *Buys 4 pack* Friends: Thanks!  Me: *sets up campaign for them that takes 3+ hours* Friends: NOBODY LIKES THAT GAME BUT U ME: *sighs* ------------------------------------------ Fun game with friends Not so much without friends, too bad i dont have any"
"The full way to have an entire table top experiance with a amazing workshop of free quality classics. A must recomend for people who used to do a game night, but have now moved away. Use steams voice functions and your set."
Have the NEED for a tabletop experience but can't quite find the friends locally to play?  LOOK NO FURTHER THAN TABLETOP SIMULATOR.  Out of all of the games in the past that have done this none of them have reached the simplicity and accuracy of an actual tabletop experience like this title has. The community is still alive and well with new mods coming out every week.  I'd much recommend you find a group outside of the games server browser and play that way.
"I just missed out on the sale, but I honestly don't care. TTS is an awesome sandbox for board and card games. For someone like me, who has friends all over Europe as opposed to people living nearby, this 'tool' is fantastic for those weekly get togethers (it helps to have some friends who are into tabletop gaming!).  Don't worry about content, Steam Workshop alone has hundreds, if not thousands, of mods that are either recreations, parodies, or emulations of classic and well loved games. There are other places to go too! Also there are plenty of original community made games to play out there.  Given the time, the assets (made by others or yourself), and a bit of patience, you could make yourself the most intricate of board or card game. Axis and Allies? No problem! Set up the board once and save it so you never have to spend hours setting it up ever again! Dungeons and Dragons your thing? There are numerous methods of putting together your favorite pen and paper RPG! Table Hockey? Pong? Monopoly? StarFluxx? Cards Against Humanity? Chance are someone has the game for you!  A great party game best played with friends, much easier than setting up webcams and clearing table space! TTS is a fanatstic goto for hours of fun, well worth the full price!"
I finally played a board game without losing any friends.
Connect 4 God.
Satisfies my boardgame itch immensely. I should have bought this long ago.
so cool! - theres many board games to play with steam workshop so there is always something to do.  - contorls are basic and easy! - some board gmaes on here cost $40+ irl. but people made them on steam ws so you can get it free :) - Highly Recommended
Boardgame night need not be constrained by physical location any longer.
One of the best goddang games you could get.
"Great modding community, fantastic and well polished games, Fantastic game!  Pretty much any board game with any of your friends around the world!  10/10 - GAMEPLAY 10/10 - COMMUNITY MODS AND SUPPORT 8/10 - PRICE 10/10 - REPLAYABILITY  9.5/10 - OVERALL"
 Early Access Review
"Tabletop Simulator offers endless hours of entertainment with friends anywhere in the World!!! In this game, you are capable of playing almost any Boardgame or Tabletop Game you can think of; without actually paying for them!!! (Is this even Legal?)    All hail Tabletop Simulator!"
Didn't know how to play blackjack so I brought the tablet tool into the game and looked up a YouTube video on it. 11/10 best YouTube sim out there.
10/10 Strategy game.lets players experience what its like to player some board games that they've never even heard of or maybe some new ones creative players have made on the workshop.
"Fantastic concept, fantastic execution.  I've been a big fan of board games ever since my high-school buddies and I started to get together on Friday nights to play Eclipse. When college came around, however, we could no longer get together and play since I moved out of state. I didn't realize how much I missed board games until I picked up TTS during its last sale. I was originally skeptical about the game's ability to provide intuitive controls for manipulating various game pieces, but boy was I wrong. While TTS is primarily a physics sandbox and doesn't necessarily enforce game rules (it's up to the players to play a fair game), it does incorperate a whole lot of tools, resources, and code to allow games to be played just as they would in real life if not better. The ability to stack and shuffle card decks, hide your hand, flip individual pieces, etc. means that tasks that might ordinarily require a lot of fiddling and potentially make a mess become nothing more than a few simple hotkey-presses. I've yet to play any long-winded games like Eclipse (Maybe once finals are over XD), My experience with TTS thus far has shown that it is very easy to use and incredibly fun. I'd definitely recommend it to my old friends so we can play games together again.  Pros: - Board games - Online multiplayer, for when you have no friends ;_; - Steam Workshop support - Can join any game and mods will auto-download and cache - Cosmic Encounter DLC (I have the physical game. It's fantastic) - Easily create quality custom content  Cons: - Voice chat could use expansion (e.g. Indicator above player profile pic when chatting rather than in sidebar) - Playing in a virtual environment (esp. with strangers) can feel less socially satisfying - Morally questionable in regards to playing published games for free off the Workshop  Finally, it's important to note that the game is still being updated and improved, and the devs still have a lot to put into the game before they're finished. The list of future improvements and Kickstarter goals can be found on their site if you're still skeptical about the future of the game's development."
i was forced to write this review 10/10
Friend became a Monopoly moguel I lost all my properties and monies He gave me a $10 pity check I hate him so much  $10/10
"This is the best game you could ever play with friends, thanks to the Steam Workshop there is an unlimited number of games you can play. The price may seem high, but it is certainly worth the money."
upd.  One of the earlier updates has fixed everything. Linux version works great.  The best simulator for tabletop games ever. It would be great if there would be VR support (i heard the support will be made soon).  P.S.  The simulator works great with Steam Controller ;)
"please, dont overlook this gem of a game. it might seem as a simple game from the trailers, but the comunity have done so much more to the game. you are able to download games from the workshop and host sesions online. buying this game isnt only buying chees, cards and yatzy, but a door to a whole new world of tabletop games you have never heard of before. all those things about 'You have to have friends to play the game with', or 'this game cant be played alone' is lies. the comunity will be there to teach you new games and to have fun with. I would recomend you having a microphone as it can be hard sometimes to comunicate with other players without. 9/10. easy pick for any pc-gamer"
" Tabletop Simulator  is exactly what the name implies- it's a tabletop simulator.  The game is overall amazing and has some amazing workshop content, involving the littlest things that make your games of poker the slightest bits more fun, or the large card games from real life such as  Secret Hitler .  Overall, this game is a 9/10 in my book, and I highly recommend you get it for it's high replay value."
awesome game to play...every game known to man on here
Very good concept!
"Exactly what it says on the tin.  Thanks to its highly customizable scenarios because of the tools available, any concievable tabletop game can be played on this. There are a lot of games available both from the workshop and paid dlc, most of which I just use workshop.  Hopfully they reach out to tabletop companies so they could impliment them into this sim and sell it on this platform, I would love to see some official games, even though player created ones are usually fine enough.  With potential oculus rift support, and it being on sale at the time of this review, I dont see a reason not to have it."
"Had this game for a while. Has a ton of options for playing all those board games we love, fun physics of 3d models, and tons of free games to try. Get it, and make sure you get it for your friends."
"Basically... this can be any card- and boardgame that exists. I'm not really sure what else I need to say - it doesn't feel as smooth as playing a physical card- or boardgame, but it does its job well regardless. All you have to do is check the workshop for a game you want to play and you're set. Find your friends and play."
"  Just got the game last night, instantly impressed. If it exists you can play it on here most likely. :) 10/10"
5 step summary of this game  Step 1. Buy This Game  Step 2. Go on a server  Step 3. Throw random pieces of the table  Step 4. Flip the table  Step 5. Await your server ban   10/10 would get banned again.
I can finally play UNO and Yu-Gi-Oh! with my online friends and flip the table without consequences or harming those around me. Best $20 I've spent in ages.
Everything was going great until we all got the achievement for not flipping the table for an hour.
"From my uncle Scrooge point of view, you can play any board game as much as you want for 20$ AND will always be guaranteed to have someone to play with. The simulator itself is also really well executed and has such an item variety that anything from Eldritch Horror to MTG is easy to mod into the game. Did I mention you can create an Internet browser via an in-game tablet and listen to music from YouTube?"
Pros: -Tons of games -Workshop for more games -Online multiplayer -Flipping the table -Custom objects  Cons: -Tons of locked servers -No people to play with -Trolls  9/10
Interesting concept.
"Love the game concept, love the execution. This game will bring board games to the digital age!!"
"Crazy awesome game, 9.5/10"
"You should probably only get this game if you have friends willing to play with you.  If you have friends, then play Cards Against Humanity with them. If not, play Chess with yourself and mope about your undying loneliness.  A good platform for messing around (and occasionally playing tabletop games) nonetheless."
"Great game, wish they added a way to save custom tables and backgrounds so you could mix and match more, otherwise 10/10 would buy again."
"Having my last written Final-Exams in Physics tomorrow but I decided to pause studying and look at steam. I bought this Simulator and I'm having fun and stopped studying completely!  The RPG mode is where you can be for hours and still have fun ALONE!!   I built a house with 2 soldiers in it, 2 Giants outside the doors and a Dragon looking towards the house, attacking it I simulated a fight of those and in the end the Dragon won by destroying and killing everything  Not regretting this at all  But now I have to start studying again :P  I can't use Tabletop Simulator Physics in my Physics Final-Exam   Oh yeah I had to reccommend this game and give a review: BEST 'GAME' EVER IF YOU CAN PLAY ALONE I hope I can get to play this with friends too after my exams XD  DEFINITELY RECOMMENDING THIS!!! Fun for yourself and with others"
"Good game, very addicting"
"Surprisingly addictive, whether you just want to play or love to create this game will pull you in and not let you go. I use it for things ranging from playing DnD remotely with friends, to playing games like connect four and superfight with my little girl. If you are trying to figure out what this game is about be sure to check out the workshop, this is the real heart of Tabletop SImulator. Even if you're the first of your friends to pick this up there is a great community here that will give you more opportunity to play and make new firends than you could ever handle. I can't recomend this game highly enough!"
A must have for board-game fans who have long distance friends. Check my subscription list if you want some suggestions. :)
If you like boardgames and want to play with a buddy in another country this game is the one for you. It has pretty much any game you can think of.
"I spent half an hour with a friend solving a jigsaw puzzle of Nicolas Cage's face, and flipped the table when we were about to finish it.  10/10"
Why did it take me so long to buy this game. So many board games to choose from!
"This game is such a blast. It's perfect when you've got a hilarious group of friends that lives all over the place, and you still wanna have that boardgame experience with them.   Plus it's great just for messing around. I don't think I'll ever complete a game of Chess, because once someone starts losing, the pieces start flying. :O"
Great with friends. Who doesn't love some bored games?
"The only real downside is that some of the controls can be wonky from time to time, but if you can get friends in who don't intentionally like to mess things up (though thankfully there is a rewind button for moments like that), then there is lots of fun to be had with Tabletop Simulator. The standard games as well as the workshop ones are definitely worth checking out, and it's a good way to introduce friends who have never played tabletop games before."
awesome game with alot of possibilitys makes me want a vive even more
This 'game' is about as fun as you make it ^^
"Very fun, as it has workshop capability. I enjoy the games like Cards Against Humanity and other ones like them. I also like that there is a level editor built into the main menu so you can make games/maps for the workshop. 9/10"
"Wow. Tabletop Simulator is really amazing. If your talented with programming / scripting, you'll have a truck load of fun making mods for your own game, or for games out there already ... If your looking for a dynamic gaming environment, you have found it ... This sandbox will allow growth in many ways. And for the price, you can't beat the amount of entertainment you'lll get from this ... game ? ....   Really cool stuff .... Yeah, I said cool :P"
"Very very nice multiplayer game, once you get used to the controls."
It's awesome because you can do whatever you want on there. There are no rules.
"Absolutly an amazing, only problem is that if your friends dont also have this game, you may not enjoy it to its fullest extent."
People keep quitting when I'm about to beat them at chess. They only ever stay and play when they're winning.
I can play multiplayer games alone without having the lonely pain of putting up and tearing down a multiplayer game alone.  10/10
"This tool is excellent; I can finally play boardgames with my friends and family who live several states away. =) we've been having a blast; the way the system works, its the next best thing to being in the same room. Better, in fact: how many times in real life have you wished you had a button that would 'Save' the game so you could come back to it later?  Not to mention the 'Flip Table' feature after your buddy wins with a surprise comeback! its pretty fun to watch. All in all, I super recommend this product."
"If you're any kind of boardgamer, you NEED this. "
10/10 has doppler effect.

  10/10 would flip the table again. friends included. just pop in a random server and start your journey. possibly best antisocial sociality simulator(lolwut?!).
Tabletop may seem like just old classic board games but think again. You can do anything you want like knock pieces over while playing with a friend. Google something on the inside game computer. No wonder this game made it to VR gaming.
"One of the best games I have ever played.  You can just do anything you want in this game; from playing a normal game of chess, to tableflipping from rage.  Though the best part of this game is the  Workshop"
It does its job perfectly. Mods are what make it eternal though. FOR THE EMPEROR! 5/5
this game is ♥♥♥♥ing great
"Tabletop Simulator is exactly that. A simulation of all kinds of table tops.  I love board games and tabletop wargaming but sadly, the people I normally play with live all over the country and we only get to play games once or twice a year.  But now, Tabletop Simulator lets us get together online, put on our headsets and boardgame or wargame to our hearts content.  The program itself has some basic games and some more complex paid for ones, but it’s the modding community where the game really shines. Modders have faithfully digitally recreated hundreds of classic board games and wargames and has also allowed creative people to make their own games for people to play.  The game can never replace the atmosphere of playing at a real table with your friends around you, hanging out, eating snacks and socialising. But it does have a couple of advantages. Thanks to it being in a digital world and the best modders using scripting, setup takes mere moments and if it’s getting late, simply save and load up later! No need to pack everything into its box (the point at which most people suddenly leave the room in real life).  Something that does worry me is copyright. I’m not sure how it all works but I do worry that companies may take down some of the recreated games. This hasn’t happened however, despite the game being around for some time now. A lot of the games require a rulebook which is not provided (meaning one of you needs to actually own a real copy) but many games come complete with Pdf. style rules in the game. I’m slightly torn on this as I feel that having to buy one of the many games that companies have created in the real world is the right thing to do, as the creators put in a lot of creative effort to make them for us, but like every person I love a good freebie!  Legalities of copyright aside Tabletop Simulator is a great program with many great games available.  If you love playing board games then Tabletop is a must! "
Got distant friends? Wanted to play with them almost every conceivable board game you can think of that existed in your life?   Get Tabletop Simulator!   Nuff' said!
"It's a solid game that has just about every tabletop game ever made. Controls are easy to learn, from turning the table to grouping certain items. Overall, it's just a ton of fun when you've got friends to play with, and if you don't, you can just find some servers to join to make new ones! Browse the workshop and find some games from your childhood, and have fun reminiscing."
fun to play with friends
"You can play board games with friends, but online. There isn't much to it."
This game is really only good with friends.  If you don't have any friends who own this and will play it with you it isn;t worth buying.  With friends this is one of the best bang for your buck games out there.
"Tabletop Simulator is an amazing popular board game simulator. You could do anything pretty much like flipping the table and adding materials. Similiar to real life board games very calm and casual until someone flips you off in the chat. I would recommend you get a better performance computer if you can, since mine doesn't work too well because it lags.  Overall a 9/10 minus 1 point for the lag for me. Give it a shot, it's worth the try."
"Fun game, a friend bought it for me and I've played it bunches. There are several features to make even the more complicated games possible!"
It showed me a bunch of board games I didn't know I liked. Please help.
Great way to rage at friends you've never met. 10/10
It showed me a bunch of board games I didn't know I liked. Please help.
I use it to play d&amp;d and it works pretty well. Id say if you want to play any type of board game with friends through the internet this is the tool for you. Sometimes during long session if the other player is idle for more than 10 minutes they get disconnected :(. Otherwise great table top simulator.    SIDE NOTE: TRAILERS ARE CRINGY AS ♥♥♥♥. Now that i have made my piece a actual bit of advice; learn how to play complex board games or table top game before trying to learn them in game. Trust me.   Edit: Most of the trailers are cringy*  Edit's Edit: 80%*
Really well-made and fun. I was surprised at the amount of games that are available on TTS.
A great utility.
"Bought the game on sale and started playing around with it. So far solitaire has been pretty fun, table flipping is halarious, the wealth of options and the extent to which you can manipulate any item in the game is staggering, and I'm posing this review on a tablet I spawned in the game! What more can you ask for?! I've been looking at this title for a few months now, wanting to pick it up on sale not just for all the fun stuff included in the game already, but the nice selection of games available as DLC as well as full Workshop support, allowing for potentially infinite games! Overall, this is a fantastic product and can see the incredible potential of what can be done with it; now I just need to convince a few friends to pick it up as well and good times will certainly be had!"
You can find almost any board game and then play with friends online. Works great!
"8/8, would play again. Multiplayer is amazing."
"What more could I say about this game is that it is fun, glad I found it on sale. but perhaps regular price wouldn't of bothered me to much. otherwise, hopefully I can do more stuff with this game. thank you steam for putting this game on sale."
This game is fantastic for tabletop games. The physics work wonderfully.
Can play DnD without having to be in same room. 10/10
"You can play board games with friends, but online. There isn't much to it."
This game is really only good with friends.  If you don't have any friends who own this and will play it with you it isn;t worth buying.  With friends this is one of the best bang for your buck games out there.
"An open sandbox for playing just about any board or cardgame you want. If it's not there, you can import it yourself and start playing. Always wanted to make and playtest a game yourself? You've got all the tools right here.  Most people want to play Secret Hitler, though ... so I recommend bringing friends with you if you want to play other stuff."
"This is a really versatile game, it seems really fun... to bad you need friends to play it...."
Played monopoly and had a terrible time. I barely had enough money to pay any of my fees or taxes and I had to mortgage all of my properties before eventually going bankrupt. 10/10
Tons of laughs to have with friends
"Played Dungeons and Dragons with friends and got bored waiting for my turn, so I played chess with a friend in the same game  Played a game within a game during another game 10/10"
Best table-flipping-into-a-void-simulator on the market. Get it while it's cheap!
"8/8, would play again. Multiplayer is amazing."
"What more could I say about this game is that it is fun, glad I found it on sale. but perhaps regular price wouldn't of bothered me to much. otherwise, hopefully I can do more stuff with this game. thank you steam for putting this game on sale."
it's complete! there all there!
This game has infinite games in it. Just think of the value
"Lots of fun, for me it's a great tool to test the decks for cardgames I play IRL, without having to purchase all the cards."
"Excellent if you have a group of friends that don't live close enough to get together for game nights. Workshop has great selection of all sorts of board games and card games you can think of.  It can, however, be tough to find public games if you don't know anyone playing."
"Tabletop Simulator is one of the most interesting and exciting PC games I've seen in a long time. Its got me rethinking what a digital game is and has potentially limitless depth. I must say that the developers have done a pretty lousy job marketing their own product- there’s a lot more to this than the table flip.  In case you don't know, and the name isn't obvious enough, Tabletop Simulator it is a simulator of physical games. Tabletop Sim isn’t really a computer game in the normal sense as the software doesn’t regulate moves, rules and victory conditions. I wouldn’t go as far to say that Steam should classify this as ‘software’, but it is indeed less a game and more a tool for playing games.  To play the games you manipulate physics-based objects in the exact same way you’d use a physical table. If you have to move a piece 3 spaces then you must grab the piece with your virtual hand and move it one, two, three spaces. Dice rolls aren’t a random number generator you click on- they’re modelled three-dimensional objects you have to toss across the table- just don’t be over-zealous and pelt them off the table. Actions like that make Tabletop Sim far more immersive than any other digital board game conversions.  The controls are very smartly designed and cover pretty much all of the actions you would want to take when handling dice, models or cards. You can easily flip and rotate anything. If you throw any cards in your direction, they will snap into a hand area, obscuring their faces from the other players. Its smart decisions like this that prevent the virtual hand from becoming too cumbersome to manipulate with a mouse. The devs have succeeded in simplifying the most repetitive actions you’d perform with a board/card game. Some tasks are easier to do in TS than real life like the ability to shuffle cards by just shaking the mouse or the ability to snap placed objects onto a grid. I also must praise the ability to see a close-up of a card at anytime by holding alt. That one feature has probably saved me a ridiculous amount of time moving the camera. There is also controller support that I’m yet to try out myself.  Tabletop Sim really does just give the players some objects on flat surface. Its up to the humans involved to follow the rules and maintain a semblance of order. In spite of the inclusion of some admin powers, the potential for griefing is great. That is, if you were to play with strangers. In the 30+ hours I’ve played Tabletop Simulator, its always been with a small group of internet buddies with a skype chat running in the background. Its perfectly possible to play games with strangers- there is a standard server browser- but on a personal, social basis, I can’t bring myself to jump into a random server as TS requires chat. Perhaps there are more outgoing people out there than me but if I play a board game then I personally would choose to sit at a table with friends rather than with strangers. This review is now veering in a more personal direction so it would suffice to say that I can’t completely exclude the possibility of using TS as a way of meeting new people. Board games are relatively slow affairs compared to video games and are therefore excellent pastimes for socialising. You can even goof off while waiting for your slow friend, flinging coins in their direction and inflating the size of cards… which is slightly less a ‘simulation’ but its all good, stupid fun.  Honestly, in reviewing Tabletop Simulator I have to get into the very appeal of board and card games as a whole. The impressive quality of TS is that it can take all of into the digital realm. The two main benefits of this transition are: You can play board games with your friends across the internet, including the friends you’ll most likely never meet in person. TS could theoretically offer unlimited games developed by other players all of which are untethered by any restrictions hard-coded into the software. That second point is a bit of a legal and perhaps even moral issue- so lets elaborate on it. Tabletop Simulator has mod support. This means that anyone can replicate any board game to have ever existed. There are perhaps some that can’t be 100% accurately remade but with custom models there are very few limits. For deckbuilding games such as Magic The Gathering you can independently make a deck in one mod, save it, then carry that across into another game to pit it against an opponent (who is wielding their own custom deck).  Mods that use copyrighted assets are nothing new but these mods let you replicate the game experience as a whole. Imagine LittleBigPlanet let you download the original Super Mario Brothers. Not as a reskin of the floatly Sackboy adventures but as a replication so accurate you might as well be playing the game on a NES emulator. It would be a legal nightmare and the mods of TS very much border on this concept.  I haven’t heard of anything too controversial on the Tabletop Sim front, but that may be because of how relatively obscure it is at the moment. Whether or not these mods do indeed break any laws isn’t my decision to make. As it stands, the issue is whether or not you, the player, have a problem with it . To be perfectly honest, I don’t have a problem with it at all and actually consider the mods to be the main selling point of the product. Perhaps I was wrong about the poor marketing; perhaps the devs chose to hold that particular selling point closer to their chest.  For me, having mods is like having access to an unlimited toy-box and the vast majority of my time has been dedicated to playing copyrighted material (particularly Dominion). To defend the mods (and possibly justify my own use of them) these game are still mere recreations of the real products. One could argue that playing mods may encourage more people to buy the real physical board game. I know my numerous online sessions of Dominion has encouraged me to play more of it in person, which I have done so. I also look forward to buying my next expansion pack soon.  Tabletop Sim also includes some standard copyright-free games such as chess and reversi. There are normal decks of playing cards and given how many games you can play with those alone TS may still be a sound investment without requiring mods. The truly creative may use the mod capabilities to create their own original games. TS may even prove to be an ample testing ground for new board game designs.   Tabletop Simulator is an excellent union of digital games and traditional physical games. It’s a testament to the fact that board games have social qualities that a digital game will never be able to replicate- even if that amounts to nothing more than being able to fling the pieces around like an idiot. It should go without saying at this point but this should not be purchased if you have zero interest in playing with others. Solitaire only goes so far. This is a social game. Buy it with the intention to play with friends. If all of this sounds appealing to you, it may even be worth buying Tabletop Simulator in a pack of 4, as I did. This ensures that you’ll have some people to play with and may even prove to be one of the best gaming purchases you’ve ever made. It did for me.  EDIT: The game has since left early access and continues to improve with smart game additions."
An amazing experience and one of the best time/Price ratios for any game.
it's nice
"So many games and mods with the workshop. Easily 10,000+ games within a game."
Red dragon inn should be dlc
"Ten bucks for ten thousand games? Seems legit. For those of us who like to make our own board or card games, either as a hobby or professionally, TTS is an amazing program for crafting early prototypes as well.  I kickstarted this project what feels like forever ago because TTS seems like an essential program for any even slightly social gamer, or even for non-gamers who just enjoy a good board game with the mates every now and then."
"Fun game, best played with friends. Lots of trolls on certain public rooms, but the game mechanics are easy to learn and the possibilities are endless with this. I've played everything from Cards Against Humanity to Dungeons and Dragons. The workshop is filled with lots of great content too."
Amazing game. Absolutely worth buying when it's on sale
Superb Game Within a Game
Best game within a game
"Great game. If you have tons of free time and the will to learn, you will have a blast. Easy to pick up controls too."
"If you enjoy tabletops, then get this game. I've never had a problem with this game. I've played games on here to try them out before buying, Highly Recommended!!"
Came back to this game after awhile and find it just keeps getting better and better!
I like how you can play a ton of games in this... game! lol There are a lot of fun multiplayer board games that you can play from anywhere! :3
This game is very cool! All kind games can be found in workshop and its very fun to play with friends!
The only game that I can pay to own and the play board games I'd normally have to pay for free. 10/10 Would roll the dice again.
Shoot throw away all youre actual board games and buy this.
"Tabletop Simulator is one of the coolist Sims out there. I love playing Boardgames and to be able to play with poeple all over the world, an see how new caltures play all types of Games theres nothing like it."
Play board games with your friends without the need for travel.
"I have 180 hours on TTS, and I will probably continue playing it for years to come. If you are into board games and socializing, this is pretty much a can't miss. This might be my number one steam recommendation other than Skyrim. It can seem intimidating at first, but the community is very friendly, and it's actually pretty easy to learn the mechanics. Give it a shot, it's great!  10/10 Buy it"
"This is probably the most inventive, creative use for a desktop computer I've seen in YEARS. It has opened whole new doors for the future of computer gaming, and I cant wait to see what comes of it!!"
Simulates tabletop games pretty well    especially when the background is a church
Loving the workshop support. Great community puting out modules for all sorts of boardgames.
This is a really fun game and I love the fact about playing board games on the computer its almost better then irl?
"If you like board or card games, get this."
With Tabletop-sim you always have a game at your hand if boredom arises from Triple-A disappointsments. D:
Flip the table!
The best game to play some classic board game classics!

"This is basically any board game you have ever played and more, A little clunky in the controls when getting used to it but definately a fun game!"
10/10 would flip tables again
"Such a good friendly game, or not, depending on who gets Mayfair"
"More flips, more wins. 10/10"
"I'm one of the many Kickstarter backers, and I have zero regrets. Already a brilliant concept when it first came out, it has only gotten better with each subsequent update. The perfect way to play Cards Against Humanity with friends across the world!"
not what i thought.. this is more for the design aspect than i thought... i am looking more for create and play aspect... but i think i will learn more over time as i try and create games and use mods ive found of games i love!
"Hours of entertainment, a multitude of board games, steam workshop...what more is there to ask for?"
"  Quite a lot of fun, honestly. highly customizable, a vibrant steam workshop community, and easy to use online multiplayer support. If you can dream it, you can play it. or something.  5/7, bought copies for all of my friends. Like 20 copies, I think."
Great game that can become any board game you want it to be. Amazing! The controls are pretty intuitive and easy to learn for how many there are. I especially like how you can save objects to your chest and add them to your other games if you choose.
Playing chess with poker pieces. BREAK THE SYSTEM
"Tabletop Simulator is a must have for any board game enthusiast, offering a lot of community content for great times with a party of friends. Easy mechanics allow for smooth control over the game and the game can be saved for those longer sessions. Players can add their own scripting for easier control of games or subscribe to content. If you really enjoy something add it permanently to your game chest full of additional pieces and tools (tablet, calculator, etc.)."
you can play any game you want to
this game is the best BUY IT! dont let my hours fool ya
Great way to play board games with friends that are too lazy to leave their houses
"This game is great, you can play literally any card or board game imaginable. But I'm warning you now, unless you have friends to play with, you shouldn't get this game. Multiplayer servers have some of the rudest people I've met. I personally have gotten kicked and banned for really dumb reasons. So make sure you're playing with friends exclusively, or be prepared to be treated like crap."
It's got so many different games in it and it does it well. Just grab a mod for another board game if you get bored.
"A really fun game to play with friends, what's more besides the several pre-set tabletop games that you'll get for purchasing this game, you can also download THOUSANDS of other tabletop games in the workshop! So this game will keep you occupied for a longg time"
Totally a game to play with friends when all of us are bored.

get some friends and this game
"Such a fun game with friends and when you're far apart in real life, this game and video chatting makes it like you're all together again for a big drink"
worth just to play the pokemon game alone
Probably one of the greatest things to ever be conceived in the realm of video games. The mod support is quite extensive and it is easy to invent your very own board games with the tools and tutorials provided.
Losing at a game? Just hit the 'I ruin friendships' button and flip the whole table.
My friends want me to stop flipping the table.
"You can have quite some fun with friends, and explore a hole lot of board games that would otherwise cost you a lot! Playing with strangers though is not very fun, so I would only recomend it if a group of friends all got this together. Or if you have a passion for making the boards in the workshop. It's not very easy to get into the mechanics, at first it will be frustrating that you cant use your hands, but not to worry, you can always flip the table or cheat and blame others!"
Wish I had more friends that liked tabletop games. This is the perfect game for that.
you can be as mean as you want without getting punched ;)

High resolution and basic scripting is supported too oh and you can even save and load sessions if your playing long winded boardgames.

Tabletop Simulator comes with many of the common board games you'll know and love to get you started.

The online community is very helpful and lots of people are often willing to let you watch or teach you how to play a new game you are not familiar with.  Tabletop is very simple to learn and within an hour or so you'll be familiar with most of the controls. I found it ran on both my 6 core gaming PC and my older laptop with onboard graphics (not on full detail mind you). Hosting a game allows you to kick and ban trouble makers and assign game permissions and chat is fully integrated into the game. I enjoy a good Tabletop session over Skype with my friends on a Sunday evening as it's so easy to get into.  For those light hearted moments you can also flip the table and wreck chaos on your friends for a cheap laugh and there's even a magic UNDO button.

All have been great fun and I even spent and hour with friends browsing the Steam Workshop and installing stuff to play in the future. The Steam Workshop files even follow you around if you install Steam and Tabletop on another PC!"
"Fun game, would flip table again and again, and possible again."
"This made my christmas last year, duking it out on Battleships, jigsawing and playing Rummy until the early hours with a bottle of bourbon, a lot of laughs and good company.  'It's chess not CHECKERS' * steals pieces :)"
"Awesome 'game', the Vive support is great."
Pretty fun game within a game. Can play boardgames like RISK and Monopoly and be able to save and pick up anywhere. No more having to carry boards on the subway or through coffee shops.
5/5 Best fun I have ever had in gaming. Great fun with friends!
Amazing fun with friends!!!!!
"It's good. Like, really good.  It's exactly what you see. A simulator for Tabletop games. I personally only use it for a pseudo-dnd type game with my own friends, and that's probably all I'll use it for.  But, it works wonderfully for it. It's much more fun and interactive to say the least, when compared to roll20 (for my purposes). It feels like you're actually at a table with a bunch of friends, not on a computer.  10/10. Would buy again.  EDIT:  11/24, bought two of my friends that don't have TTS the game. Feels good.  11/25, lost a friend to the pits of hell. Doesn't feel so good."
If there's a board game its on here. 10/10 I played as a dungeon master in a DnD game without ever playing before in my life.

Amazing fun with friends!!!!!
"fun game, you can easily lose like 4-5hrs without noticing the time. great community mods"
FLIP THE TABLE! RIGHT NOW!
"Virtually endless fun. Can't encourage you more to get it. So much creativity, and so much games to play.  Board game afficionados, get this one!"
"Litterally every board game you can think of, and if it isnt on the workshop, then you can always put it on there yourself, or make up your own game. Making for a game that you can play something different and have fun with an endless ammount of times."
"I've spent hours playing this game without realizing it, only to be reminded when I find myself hungry after 6 hours of not eating."
10/10 would flip tables again
lots of fun with friends.
everything you'd want.
Fantastic for playing board games online. The selection of games available as mods is amazing.
Great plataform to play with friends or to find new ones. A lot of boardgames to play; classic and new. The keyuboard mapping is always available in game if you want to fully use the tools this game has -recomended for narrative driven boardgames.
table top simulator is a valuable judgeing platform for testing and playing some of the greatest bordgame's in history and some new indy bordgames
Pocket communities of people who import and upgrade different board games. Any game you play in this will be slightly different than if you played it in real life but not in a bad way.
"The possibilities are literally endless. Either you can find a copy of a game out there to play on the marketplace, or find the rescources you need to build and code your own. It's perfect for someone like me who loves board games but lives on the other side of the country from those i typically enjoy playing them with.  The controls are pretty straight forward, though it takes a bit to get used to changing cameras and manipulating pieces for those who arent familiar with gaming. But other than that, this is pretty much required for anyone who likes traditional games."
Great game and a great concept. Plenty of life on the Steam Workshop to keep Tabletop Simulator alive for quite some time.
first thing i did was solve a mostly-white jigsaw puzzle and it took nearly an hour  i also bought this purely for the flipping table function works great 11/10
"This is by-far the best game I have on Steam. It's really a many games within a game. Between the vast selection of Workshop content, and the great stock content, you'll never run out of things to do in TTS. I even made my own custom card game with this! It's all about freedom of creativity. And in a game you play with pals, freedom is king. :3"
Nominated for 'Best Game Within a Game' because there are VERY MANY GAMES you can play within this video game.
"Lets be honest, the only reason i wrote this review was to obtain The Steam Award badge."
"This game is simply fantastic. The workshop support allows basically any tabletop game to be played, even if your gaming group is hundreds of miles away."
Must have for anybody who enjoys tabletops but doesn't want to put on pants.
Its a good game
"I feel like this game should be standard in everyone's library. It's literally exactly what the name of the game implies. Being able to simulate what people do on a tabletop is exactly what this game is. There are no limits to what you can do when it comes to boardgames, cardgames, etc.  Recommendation: If you pick this game up (which you should totally do) be sure to get your friends to get it and give 'Secret Hitler' a go. it's tons of fun and you'll discover mroe and more games to play on here.  Have a blast!"
"Great with Friends, as you can import Games or even make your own! Also great for RPG's!"
"This is a great implimentation of a physics simulator to do literally any board game that might be there. I enjoy it as this allows me to play on days that I would rather stay home in my pajamas but still get some gaming and social time with my friends, not to mention some friends who live in other states. Not all games work as you would expect but there are a whole lot more hits than misses in this. The steam workshop for this game seems lively and there seems to be a lot of content being made on a regular basis. This is also easy on older PCs as some of my friends have PCs that can't handle most digital board games out there due to particles and such. All and all, a big recommendation from me."
"Tabletop Simulator aims to be the ideal platform to play games, traditionally limited to physical contact, anywhere in the world with anyone you want. This game has bridged long distance friendships and keeps board game night going no matter the distance. The game just gives you a sandbox to play in and doesn't force any tabletop game's rules on the players, this allows for any complexity of game to be played. All you need is to scan the board game's assets into the computer to play it digitally with friends. Have no idea how to do that? That's OK because one of this game's biggest strengths is it's mod support. Check out the Workshop and you will most likely find what you are looking for. I think this game should be a must have for anyone who enjoys traditional board, card and tabletop games."
I always thought this game wasnt for me. I was wrong. Lots of fun with friends and endless possibilities.
"This part of the review addresses the original, mouse-and-keyboard method of play. I have also played it in VR; check further down for my thoughts on that experience.  If you're a fan of board games, buying Tabletop Simulator is a something like buying 100 games for the price of one, plus your very own board game making kit. The engine's controls are, for the most part, smooth and easy to grasp. There are a lot of little tricks you learn how to do, as you play games with people, too. There are a multitude of games available both as paid DLC (which a host can play with friends without them needing to buy the DLC as well) and workshop mods, including some very popular mainstream board games. Many -- especially the DLCs -- are made with a surprising amount of polish and detail.  Making a game yourself couldn't be easier. You can either use the many built-in tokens and boards, or take it a step further and supply pictures for your own board and cardboard cutout tokens, OR take it another step further and supply your own models and textures. You can even script things, now, to make them automated and/or interactive.  Tabletop Simulator does have bugs, as any game is bound to when it is meant to be such an open-ended platform. They are minor enough that they can be easily overlooked. This game is the answer to the board game lover who doesn't have any local friends to play with. It's easily the best $20 I've ever spent.  *** VR ***  Note: As of this post, the VR experience is still in fairly early development. I feel this signficantly impacts how this part of the review came out.  With regards to the VR experience, TTS is still an amazing piece of software. All of the original features are there, but the implementation is much more awkward than keyboard+mouse. Some of it may still need smoothing out from the devs. It is more noticeably buggy than the original, sometimes in ways that are pretty annoying. For instance, the game has the function to search through a card deck, but when you try to do this in VR, any cards you grab move in the opposite direction that you drag them, and if you try to drop them outside of the deck to move them elsewhere, it simply ignores you.  Controller interactivity needs quite a bit of work, too. Currently, both controllers have the exact same functions for the trackpad, which is a waste when there are so many unassigned common functions of the engine that you have to go through menus to get to. It also enforces handedness; if you try to pick something up in the wrong hand, it puts it in the right hand instead, which can be strange. It makes you use that controller for everything, which makes me question if it's even worth it to use two controllers in the game. Throw and shuffle/randomize gesture physics are also needing work. Particularly stressful and complex mods are all but unplayable unless you have a beast of a machine; when the FPS dips, so does your head and controller tracking, which makes it all but impossible to point at and move things.  All of those inconveniences and annoyances aside, you can still very easily play most TTS games from inside VR. Just be prepared to use your menu button for a lot of things. Locking and unlocking pieces seems impossible in VR, which can be crippling if you don't have another player to lock/unlock things for you. TTS VR is not the worst VR experience that I've seen, but if the experience is improved upon in the future, it could be one of the best."

This is also easy on older PCs as some of my friends have PCs that can't handle most digital board games out there due to particles and such. All and all, a big recommendation from me."
"Tabletop Simulator aims to be the ideal platform to play games, traditionally limited to physical contact, anywhere in the world with anyone you want. This game has bridged long distance friendships and keeps board game night going no matter the distance. The game just gives you a sandbox to play in and doesn't force any tabletop game's rules on the players, this allows for any complexity of game to be played. All you need is to scan the board game's assets into the computer to play it digitally with friends. Have no idea how to do that? That's OK because one of this game's biggest strengths is it's mod support. Check out the Workshop and you will most likely find what you are looking for. I think this game should be a must have for anyone who enjoys traditional board, card and tabletop games."
I always thought this game wasnt for me. I was wrong. Lots of fun with friends and endless possibilities.
"This part of the review addresses the original, mouse-and-keyboard method of play. I have also played it in VR; check further down for my thoughts on that experience.  If you're a fan of board games, buying Tabletop Simulator is a something like buying 100 games for the price of one, plus your very own board game making kit. The engine's controls are, for the most part, smooth and easy to grasp. There are a lot of little tricks you learn how to do, as you play games with people, too. There are a multitude of games available both as paid DLC (which a host can play with friends without them needing to buy the DLC as well) and workshop mods, including some very popular mainstream board games. Many -- especially the DLCs -- are made with a surprising amount of polish and detail.  Making a game yourself couldn't be easier. You can either use the many built-in tokens and boards, or take it a step further and supply pictures for your own board and cardboard cutout tokens, OR take it another step further and supply your own models and textures. You can even script things, now, to make them automated and/or interactive.  Tabletop Simulator does have bugs, as any game is bound to when it is meant to be such an open-ended platform. They are minor enough that they can be easily overlooked. This game is the answer to the board game lover who doesn't have any local friends to play with. It's easily the best $20 I've ever spent.  *** VR ***  Note: As of this post, the VR experience is still in fairly early development. I feel this signficantly impacts how this part of the review came out.  With regards to the VR experience, TTS is still an amazing piece of software. All of the original features are there, but the implementation is much more awkward than keyboard+mouse. Some of it may still need smoothing out from the devs. It is more noticeably buggy than the original, sometimes in ways that are pretty annoying. For instance, the game has the function to search through a card deck, but when you try to do this in VR, any cards you grab move in the opposite direction that you drag them, and if you try to drop them outside of the deck to move them elsewhere, it simply ignores you.  Controller interactivity needs quite a bit of work, too. Currently, both controllers have the exact same functions for the trackpad, which is a waste when there are so many unassigned common functions of the engine that you have to go through menus to get to. It also enforces handedness; if you try to pick something up in the wrong hand, it puts it in the right hand instead, which can be strange. It makes you use that controller for everything, which makes me question if it's even worth it to use two controllers in the game. Throw and shuffle/randomize gesture physics are also needing work. Particularly stressful and complex mods are all but unplayable unless you have a beast of a machine; when the FPS dips, so does your head and controller tracking, which makes it all but impossible to point at and move things.  All of those inconveniences and annoyances aside, you can still very easily play most TTS games from inside VR. Just be prepared to use your menu button for a lot of things. Locking and unlocking pieces seems impossible in VR, which can be crippling if you don't have another player to lock/unlock things for you. TTS VR is not the worst VR experience that I've seen, but if the experience is improved upon in the future, it could be one of the best."
"The concept of Tabletop Simulator is awesome. Thanks to this game I get to play my favourite boardgames with friends from all over the world, and try new games before I buy the physical copies to see whether I like the gameplay. This game would be nothing without the wonderful community of modders who recreate all those games for TTS, so many thanks for that!"
"The choices are endless, and always a good excuse to bring you and your friends together."
This game + workshop = greatness.
You have a feeling of real tabletop experience. Still the best tabletop simulation game.
It's really fun to play with friends and it's mechanics are easy to pick up. Just dont play UNO with friends...not because it's bad or anything but you're friendships are gonna be tested during each and every game
"Want to play table top games but your too poor to go out and buy them? WELL TABLE TOP SIM IS FOR YOUUUUU!  like games about Hitler; we got it  like games about racial stereotypes; we got it  like chess; we go- acually if you want this game just for chess thats sad  Cant find the game you want? then make it for everyone else.  Tabletop sim, the ultimate friendship ruiner :)  "
"Great game, awesome community."
By far one of the most played games for a while now. Just good fun.
Infinite amount of games inside a $20 game! Can't believe how little it costs for how much entertainment it givces.
"Great game to play with friends. Really nice because for the twenty or so dollars for the game, you get basically ever card/board game in existence thanks to the great workshop support."
"This game really brought me back. I was able to play old games and new versions all in one place. The Steam community is fantastic and being able to waste my day playing UNO with my cousin just for laughs is amazing. Aside from some bugs in gridlock for board games, I would highly recommended to anyone."
The greatest game EVER!
"The choices are endless, and always a good excuse to bring you and your friends together."
Absolutely amazing! Great if you're in a LDR and want to play board games with your SO.
"Do you like boardgames? Card games? Want to play them online, but they have no online version? This is your lucky day..."
Great for playing board games with friends over long distances. Also an interesting alternative to apps like Roll20 for D&amp;D.
"While not precisely a game on it's own, you can technically create endless amounts of games with this 'tool', however, one of the requirements should be either patience, or having friends that also own the game, just a protip!"
"Tabletop Simulator allows my friends from afar and I to play the offline board games I've come to enjoy in college with them, online. There are several mods available, all wonderful so far."
This game + workshop = greatness.
You have a feeling of real tabletop experience. Still the best tabletop simulation game.
The greatest game EVER!
  This is a amazing game
Will anyone play the KanColle RPG with me?
"You can play any board game. If it's not there, you can make it with the excellent mod support.  The games are physics-based, meaning you actually move cards and pieces from zone to zone. This is generally a good thing; you feel more like you're actually playing a physical game with somebody. It does make lag more noticable, however."
All boardgames ever for the price of less than 1.
"This is such a great concept. At full price, this game is worth the money. You are essentially buying every popular board game for $20. My friends and I have been having a blast playing D&amp;D with it, I highly recommend it to any one who loves board games."
"This is possibly the best multiplayer game you can get for friends that love tabletop games and have enough patience to sit through them for countless hours without flipping the table and ragequitting because their roll was not favorable or anything similar.  Pros:    Many games to choose from on the Workshop    Possibility to create or adapt your own game with custom LUA scripts to facilitate certain things.   Cons:    Due to its moddable nature, you might have certain bugs within the game.    Undoing a tableflip or any mistakes might turn into a game crash if there are too many props in the table, causing you to lose your progress.  "
"After playing this game for 3 hours, I can confirm that this game HAS A TABLE FLIP FEATURE"
Very versitile. The workshop has plenty of great content.
I kickstarted the game on a whim. The idea of a physics engine for tabletop games seemed so cool!  It came out and it is even better than I hoped. I play the game for hours with friends. So many games have been added and some are even directly supported by the devs and game publishers.

Want to play board games/card games with your friends? Don't want to travel to their house? Hate clean up?  If you answered yes to one or more of these questions then Tabletop Simulator is the game for you.  Ruined friendships are non-refundable
fist of all good workshop support good multiplayer and the tutorial is whatever not so good R.I.P but i like it its so addicting
"Tabletop Simulator is a game...where you can play ANY boardgame. RPGs? Yes. Monopoly? Yes. Uno? Hell yes. Its also super easy to import your own assets/whatever into your game. So if a favorite game of yours isn't on the workshop or you just want to make your own game, its super easy to. I got a pretty good deal on this game and it goes on sale a decent bit. Also the price just got reduced, so now is the best time to buy it."
"Just buy it already. You can play any boardgame imaginable with easier set up and clean up than the physical versions. Feature rich, fun to mess around in or take seriously. Grab a few friends and have an evening with Tabletop."
"This game is worth every penny, because it allows you to play a huge amount of games. If you have friends that don't live nearby, this is the perfect way to play boardgames like old times. The list of games is very deep, so please do you or a group of your friends a solid and buy this game."
cool
"This game is the obvious choice for the 'Game Within a Game' award. As long as you have some friends (I know this can be the hardest step), you get and absolute ♥♥♥♥-ton of potential games you can play with them. If you happen to live far away from your friends but you want to play some good 'ole board games, or just mess around, this is the perfect solution.   I am going to go further and say that 20 euro for a game that offers you so much possibilities is dirt cheap, and it also goes on sales quite frequently."
"You can load in a pic to use in a jigsaw puzzle, the options are limitless."
very funny with a number of different options for games to play. I r8 8/8 m8. 
"Lots of games to play. If you have a group of friends to play with it's a blast. Even if you don't, there are lobbies online to join."
"First time I played and I went for 7 hours straight. Yeah, this one's really adicting, and you can meet great people."
"Tabletop simulator flowchart:  Do you like board games? do you have friends? do those friends like board games?  if you answered yes to all of these questions, buy this game, you owe it to yourself."
"This is the perfect gaming system for someone who wants to play a variety of games with friends they cannot see in person often. From classic games like Life to more complex adventures through BSG and Secret Hitler, this is a fabulous investment.  Note: For some reason Monopoly is an optional download. Do not download, it is a virus to the boardgame community."
I would recommend for any trad gamer or anybody who likes boards games. The workshop has pretty much any game you could want some scripted &amp; others with out
So many different games to play and many more being added. Well worth the price.
Hitler simulator 9/11 5/7
This is a game where you can do whatever you want. Also you can play other games while playing this game which is of course the best type of game to play. which is another game&gt; GAMES
Never a dull moment! Since I moved I have been able to keep playing all the board games I enjoyed playing with my friends back home. GG
Literally the best simulator ever created.
"A deck of cards would have been cheaper, but less fun."
"This is a great application that allows you to insantly connect with just about anyone around the globe, millions of games for free, and a fairly decent community. overall well well worth the 20$"
"This is such a good idea, and there are so many good games out there.  Just wish more tabetop games would create oficial dlcs for this.  The usability is not the best, but it has improved a lot, and it has a lot of small details  A much for any tabletop fan."

  This thing is totally LOL! Love it
Loads of party fun packed into a single game!
"Saved our D&amp;D sessions with friends all over the country.  Still lots to improve upon, but it is a great tool to play tabletop games when your friends live different cities. Always seems to have people in the chat looking for players for different games. Needs a better drawing tool, better FoW mechanics etc."
With over 500 hours play time i can say this is the best boardgame simulation there is.  Its literally all games you can make in one game with a huge workshop community.  A 'must have' for every boardgame geek.
Very good game and fun to play with friends. Tons of user made content available at the workshop.
"When this game came out and none my friends thought that they will end up liking this game. With us being very far away from each other and being big board game lovers, we had very few times where we can play board games with each other. With this game gives us the chance to not only play the board games we enjoy, it also simulates it in a table top enviroment which makes us feel that we are playing with each other in person. So in the end not only did I call we will end up enjoying it but we still play it thanks to all the board games we can play with game, both games that haves an existing physical version and one the community made themselves."
"If you have friends you'll have a great time. If you have a hard time getting all your homies together, don't bother."
"This 'game' allows you to play many tabletop board games, card games and RPGs. Find yourself some friends even if they are around the world and have fun."
This game is wonderful with friends
"Buying this game is like buying 1,000 board games. Although the workshop is basically a big game of copyright infringement-whack-a-mole, I can't help but feel that this game is a great way to demo games before buying them, or alternatively playing with people you could never play with in person.  Point is, I would never choose this over a physical copy, in-person with friends, but it's a fantastic tool to augment any avid board-game player's collection."
great game.
Legit favorite game ever. hope i can find some dnd players here
nice. with friends.
"This is awesome, not only are there a ton of well done free to play games for it in the workshop, but i actually prefer playing games on this due to some of the scripts. I also like the fact that i can try a game before i buy, and i don't have to worry about buying every single game i want to play. My whole family loves it."
69/69 would play Eels and Escalators with four random strangers again
"This game is so god damn intense that my friend's keyboard died while we were playing. What a high-pressure, intense game!"
This is the best thing on Steam. Period.
"Boardgames,.. but now online Its never been easier to get the lads together foe a game of w/e"
"Get a group of friends together and you can play this for days, maybe years. Online community is also one of the nicer ones, as most are willing to teach you a new game if you want to try one out."
"Now I can ♥♥♥♥ off my sister anywhere, any time, Thanks Tabletop!"
Good for playing board games with friends if:  - You don't want to go outside - You like board games  Controls are good but some interactions sometimes feel clumsy (for example stacking cards into a deck)  Overall good fun and worth the money.
"Unlimited possibilities. Goof off with your friends. Have a great time. Buy it on sale, worth your money. 10/10 would recommend."
this game is just awesome as a Tabletop sandbox.  DO ALL THE TINGS!
Playing cardboard games with my friends in this game. It's like play in real life.  Really enjoy it. Especially can play Granblue Fantasy in-game tablet too.  10/10 Would flip the table again when RAGEQUIT.
A great way to try out games before you buy
a Game where you can play Board games online? Sign me up!  If only some boardgame companies gave a ♥♥♥♥ about their games enough for people to enjoy it past its sell-by date...
just a lot of fun with friends
Great with friends and the workshop community is amazing!
Loads of fun to play with friends

Well.. what can I say. Best game ever made if you like bord games..
"An amazing game, have used it for dnd and other like games, as well as for so many friday night game nights for me and my friends who have since moved away over time!"
10/10 would flip table after losing game of Eels and Escalators again
This game is absolutely great. Pay once and get to play hundreds of board games. Well worth the price!
"So much choice, so little time. Welp gonna spend it reading the rules to a new game."
Great Concept and top notch execution for a thing that let you do a lot freely. Feel a little sad for those board game creator that got plagirize though
10/10 would flip the table again.
"So I heard you like games, so we put a game within a game so you can play a game while you play a game. Literally the game within a game game."
this is a fantastic game to play with friends online. There're so many cool board games in the Steam Workshop.
"Its absolutely excellent for the potential of playing tons of board games online. 100% must buy if you like that kind of thing. If not, you probably will be bored quickly"
Do you like board games? Card games? Tabletop RPGs? Well look no further. All these and more can be yours with Tabletop Simulator. This game is a must have for people who love tabletop games.
"The developers of this game work really hard, the program is in constant updates."
"If you have any interest in tabletop games, and you have a group of friends to play them, I HIGHLY recommend this. Some things that are quicker to do in rela life, such as a game with LOTS of tiny pieces to handle (Small World) are a little slower to play out, but still enjoyable."
A really fun game to play with friend as it houses other fun games inside for hours of endless entertainment!
IT TWAS I WHO KILLED HITLER. Man i love Secret Hitler
"Great game, you can play so many board games. Flip the table!!!!!!!"
"Very fun game. Sure it has a steep price, but it's hours of fun."

"Honestly, I really wouldn't call this game, more of a platform to play games in and it's the best one to play board games that I've found so far. Gather a couple of friends or meet some new ones while trying out all sorts of games and the increasing library size of the DLC and you get a game you'll keep playing for years on end."
Really good game to play with friends/pals/whoever all without physically setting up a boardgame or getting one in the first place.  And at the current sale price I think its a great time to buy and play with a few friends and have a swell time.  (PS this game needs to win the game within a game award out of consideration)
"over all this game is great, but there are a few things you might want to know before you buy this game 1. you need friends. well you don't need friends but this game in single player is quite sad. 2. you need internet for this game to be great and last but not least is you should use the workshop if you want to play cool new bored games"
Chess.
"I have saved so much money from this game. A little tricky to learn the UI, but aside from that, there are TONS of addons that keep this game alive."
This honestly saved me so much money on board games it's unreal. It's a must own for anyone even remotely interested in playing board games online with their friends.
While the controls can be a bit odd at times it really is a handy platform for playing board games without needing to get everyone into the same room. Quite a bit of community support as well which opens up numerous options even if some of the more complex games tend not to feel nearly as good in a virtual environment. If you cannot get everyone local to play this is not a bad alternate.
This is a great game that allows you to play board games and miniature games with friends who may not be in the same state or country as you. I also enjoy the many mods of games that people upload to the workshop and the games that have offical releases.
"Really good platform to check out games, or play board games with people far away."
A Game within a Game - with Games within those games - not to mention the game it's in.
"The tablet object allows you to access the internet with your friends on multiple websites at the same time, it's great for watching videos with friends who are too far away to meet up with."
"Excelent platform for physical game experiances within a digital sphere. I am a huge board game fan, and this game allows me to play some of my favorites with a group of friends that I wouldn't normally be able to enjoy them with. The community workshop, and the community at large, are both fantastic. The DLC's are high quality and support the original developers, as such I have a few games in double format (digital and physical) simply so I can continue to enjoy them with friends, especially since their pricing is very reasonable for a digital version.   Might not be for you if you're not intrested in board games (or card, or miniature, or....fun) but for everyone else I would consider it a library requirement"
"This is a great game to mess around with friends online. The devs update and support it very consistently and the workshop content is some of the best there is out there. If you have a lot of friends you hang out with online, this is a game worth checking out for the listed price."
"With access to hundreds of games and the ability to add your own, this is easily the best value game on Steam."
9/10
"The video makes this game look stupid and a joke, bit it actually has great community support and lots of great scans of current boardgames. Great way to test boardgames before you buy them!"

"Tabletop simulator is one of the most diverse and fun tabletop type games I have ever played. It doesn't have very many prebuilt-in games but it does come with an excellent engine to help you make your own game and more often than not, if there is a game you want to play then someone has already made it available for download in the Community Workshop. A must have for anyone who enjoys Tabletop gaming."
"Both clever in concept and execution, this game enables people around the world to sit around a virtual tabletop and play almost any game imaginable! This game is really, for better or for worse, what you make of it as its name says it all.    It is my hope to use this in the future for many rpg nights, and board game nights in general to come! (Now to convince everyone I know to get it to make that a reality…) "
"This game is so amazing. the community is so big and kind, theres a game for everyone no matter how old you are."
10/10 can flip table
cool beans
For fans board games and tabletop RPGs this is a must buy
Every board game ever? yes please!
Game in game
This game is good and epic. Peace
By far the coolest sim on the steam store. If you want to try out table top games or just play the ones you have online with your friend this is a great game for it 
Very good game for friends and has alot of games to play within it.

"This game is perfect for solo play with solitaire gameplay, coop play with freinds, and competetive play. This game is a perfect tool to host boardgames, D&amp;D campaigns, or just play little mini games and talk with people.  Most memorable moment was when I put a puzzle together while drunk with random people and listened to random music. Semi-great community.  Couldn't recommend this game more."
I had to explain to strangers on the Internet how to play Uno. This game is tons of fun; you can play like any board game ever thought of by man.
Fantastic product this is and I have awarded it the game within a game award on the steam awards.
"Beware, there are people in this world who do not know how properly to play UNO."
"Pros: -Who needs real friends for board games when you can play with virtual ones -Don't have to actually socialize in real ife -Solid selection of board games on the workshop, they have most everything inclucing a MtG playerbase -Very good simulator, controls on point, great models   Cons: -Ruin friendships with monopoly -Trolls here and there   Decision: Buy it if you enjoy boardgames. "
great to play with your table top group even from a distance
"It works as a fairly good simulation of board games, and has a good community."
The most fun I've had with friends since actually going to their houses and playing board games.
"If you like board games - ANY board game - you need this game. The community continues to make amazing content for absolutely free. Not sure if the in-game DLC is worth anything, but the free stuff you can download makes this game worthwhile, especially during the holiday sales."
"for a badge, also the table flipping mechanic is the ♥♥♥♥"
"This game is a godsend for me. So much of board gaming is people who you play with, so I frequently had problems buying a board game, then never getting anyone to play it with me. Now, I can try before I buy with my friends, and play games that are practically impossible to find at a reasonable price (Pokemon Master Trainer I'm looking at you  Plus, I can use it to play my board game collection with friends far away from me.  10/10, I encourage people to buy it every sale."
I had to explain to strangers on the Internet how to play Uno. This game is tons of fun; you can play like any board game ever thought of by man.
Fantastic product this is and I have awarded it the game within a game award on the steam awards.
"Beware, there are people in this world who do not know how properly to play UNO."
"Pros: -Who needs real friends for board games when you can play with virtual ones -Don't have to actually socialize in real ife -Solid selection of board games on the workshop, they have most everything inclucing a MtG playerbase -Very good simulator, controls on point, great models   Cons: -Ruin friendships with monopoly -Trolls here and there   Decision: Buy it if you enjoy boardgames. "
great to play with your table top group even from a distance
"It works as a fairly good simulation of board games, and has a good community."
The most fun I've had with friends since actually going to their houses and playing board games.
"If you like board games - ANY board game - you need this game. The community continues to make amazing content for absolutely free. Not sure if the in-game DLC is worth anything, but the free stuff you can download makes this game worthwhile, especially during the holiday sales."
10/10 Would table flip again
"Tabletop Simulator is the kind of game you are either going to play once for an hour with some friends, or spend hundreds of hours with your friends playing a variety of board games. The community support behind this game is excellent, and there's is a massive host of games that you can get. Quite the excellent purchase, not only economically ($20 CAD or $10 on sale) but it also provides a unique experience for those of us who can't get together in person to play board games. The automatic scripting that some of the mod creators have put into their games can often times save loads of preparation time, while enhancing the games themsleves by automatics many tiresome features.   This game is definately worth the purchase if you have friends to play with on a somewhat regular basis."

it has cards!
"If you dont mind playing board games on PC, you can save up to hundreds of euros!"
hey itsa pretty glood. Gets the job done
  i still can't remember how much money to pass out in monopoly
Literally a game within a game
Play game with friends.  Play for 2 hours in a single game.  Flip table.  Friends defriend you.  10/10 would lose friends again.
Want to buy every tabletop/board/pen and paper game in the world for 20 dollars?  10/10 would bypass all copyright/trademark laws again
its what it says it is pretty fun playing board games and stuff online with friends works well
Do i even need to buy boards games anymore this game is basically torrenting 10/10
Why sit next to the fat guy with dorito fingers when you can be all alone.( I may be mr. dorito mc'rollsalot.)  pros. +Can use workshop to get any boad or card game.[ wooo no dlc.][edit turns out there is dlc fml] +I can play with my HTC vive IF I HAD ONE! mid. =The players you can join [trolls or good guys.] cons. -The table flip is useless and is there just for a joke. -Can be boring.  7/10  Time to roll out [rolls a 1.] [tree hits xaven in face.]
Yes just yes go buy it ! its more social then any other game I know.
"I am Turk so my mother tongue is Turkish but there is minute amount Turkish player which playing this game, so i decided to write this review in English. You can play every board games in this game, for example Monopoly, UNO, Secret Hitler and a lot games like those. I highly recommend it."

Literally a game within a game
"After a full year of getting the gang together, my friends and I play a game of Secret Hitler. I get the Hitler role and wiggle my mouse furiously in delight at my facist friends. We vote carefully in every round, and I try my best to act like a good samaritan. After a number of rounds I'm finally voted Chancellor and reveal to everyone at the table that I am the Fuhrer. I then flipped the table and my teammate and I started hastily drawing swastikas on everyone's screen.  10/10 I haven't been invited to play Secret Hitler again, but Candy Land is nice too."
"I'd write a comprehensive review about this game but then I'd have to write a comprehensive review about virtually any tabletop game you could possibly think of. That would take way too long.  The game is great, handles well, and is tons of fun to play with friends and family alike. I play this game with my friend on the other side of the globe, since the latency in FPS games is intolerable. I can recommend this game(s) to anyone!"
  -Tell friends to get game -After 6 months they get it -Play uno  -Sore loser flips table  -Everyone is amazed  -next day play poker -everyone keeps flicking ♥♥♥♥ -next day revokes privileges -Friends are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ so they make there own server -Same thing happens -The cycle gets around to everone -I now have no friends   9.76/10 Would loose sanity again
Don't forget to flip the table if you are about to lose at any point
Accurately simulates the top of a table.
One of the funnioest most useful programs on Steam.
"An open sandbox for playing just about any board or cardgame you want. If it's not there, you can import it yourself and start playing. Always wanted to make and playtest a game yourself? You've got all the tools right here.  Most people want to play Secret Hitler, though ... so I recommend bringing friends with you if you want to play other stuff."
"This is a really versatile game, it seems really fun... to bad you need friends to play it...."
Played monopoly and had a terrible time. I barely had enough money to pay any of my fees or taxes and I had to mortgage all of my properties before eventually going bankrupt. 10/10
Tons of laughs to have with friends
"Played Dungeons and Dragons with friends and got bored waiting for my turn, so I played chess with a friend in the same game  Played a game within a game during another game 10/10"
Best table-flipping-into-a-void-simulator on the market. Get it while it's cheap!
Great Game! A collection of games in one game!
"I used this to test a prototype of a tabletop game a friend had to design for a class. It was literally tested exactly once, at the last minute (as you'd expect for a school project.) It was really long. Probably 4 of the 5 hours I have in Tabletop Simulator are for that one match. I won. It was a tactical game, and honestly, the idea had potential, but I doubt he'll ever go back to it.  Tabletop Simulator is exactly what it says on the tin. If you have friends who you want to play a tabletop game with long-distance, or you have friends nearby but want to play a tabletop game with them that you don't physically own, Tabletop Simulator is how you do it. People also do some neat things with it that I've messed with only a little, like 3D chess. It's a game heavily built around Workshop content. I personally don't really boot it up unless it's for a specific purpose, but it always serves that purpose well."
 Early Access Review
I have to do this the game said so.
"Great simulator, especially the x-wing miniatures mods"
"Very nice game, However it is almost a neccesity that you have friends :("
Game withen a game :D
Me: Wants to play more tabletop games with friends.  TTS: You can do that online!  Me: &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
"A game that holds many games in store for all ages. Reccomended multi player game if you love playing games like Magic the Gathering, Yugioh, Checkers, Secret Hitler, Uno, Chess, bowling and more!  - Physics can be a bit off at times but it's not game breaking.  - It's rather boring playing alone as there isn't really an ai player system for single player, so expect this game to be played with friends near exclusively.  - Has a really neat brush and pencil tool features to decorate the table and the scenery to your heart's content  - The workshop is your lifesavor as it's stuffed full of amazing games to add to the endless experiences.  - Bone/joint binding feature for shenanigans   - Has an insanely wonderful community that is more then willing to help out any questions you have for the game and its bugs if you ever encounter any."
"very nice, very wow, merry oui"
"This game is truely deserving of the 'game within a game' reward.... A friend showed me all Table Top Simulator had to over about 3 weeks ago, and I've turned on the game everyday ever since."
Amazing game. Played 4 hours and it was the best i can play with friend across the world
 This game is an absolute blast to play by yourself or with friends:
Awsome game NEEDS 64 BIT SUPPORT
absolutely randy game
Flipping the table as my sugar daddy spanks me
"A simulator that takes all the strong points of board games in real life and combines them with the conveniences of online features. Connecting strangers who have similar interests in table top games and bringing them together. Additionally, it carries a strong modding community, with fan made board games -- all for free!"
"This game is one of the most powerful tools I have seen in a long time. Every imaginable oars game is on here and if you don't see what you like you can make it. Great community of molders and designers from games to models. I use this most often to play D&amp;D, I build my own dungeons and try to use models developed in the workshop to make it feel like the real game. This is a must have for everyone, cannot recommend it enough."
Woah such a kewl game!
Really well-made and fun. I was surprised at the amount of games that are available on TTS.
I use it to play d&amp;d and it works pretty well. Id say if you want to play any type of board game with friends through the internet this is the tool for you. Sometimes during long session if the other player is idle for more than 10 minutes they get disconnected :(. Otherwise great table top simulator.    SIDE NOTE: TRAILERS ARE CRINGY AS ♥♥♥♥. Now that i have made my piece a actual bit of advice; learn how to play complex board games or table top game before trying to learn them in game. Trust me.   Edit: Most of the trailers are cringy*  Edit's Edit: 80%*
"HONESTLY, better than you think."
"I'f you and your friends like to mess around or even just watch youtube videos on a tablet together this game is for you lol also you can play literally any board game you want and the creation is endless, such a well made game i can't even begin to express how glad this game was released!"
 This game is an absolute blast to play by yourself or with friends:
Awsome game NEEDS 64 BIT SUPPORT
Have you ever wanted to play every board/card game in existence with your friends who live halfway across the world? Then what are you waiting for. You can find a mod for just about every game you can think of and if you can't find a game you like it's super easy to make it yourself.
Great. The stuff packed into this sim blows me away. Even more fun when drunk.
it gud  get it much worth it Chess D-and-D and poker is fun to play with friends :D
"In tabletop simulator you can litterally pull out a tablet and play on your favoret websites, it's a game, inside a game, inside a game..."
"Buy this game, it is really good, UNO is the best gamemode KappaPride"
"A great, casual game to play with friends. This game is great to me because weather you are playing with 1 friend or 7, you get the same amount of fun and the same experience."
You simply can't hate this game. Don't like to play Chess? Play Monopoly. Don't like to play cards? Do a jigsaw.  You always have a way around this game :D 9/10
Blackjack and daemons
Great game once you get a hold of the controls. They can be a bit much but I believe they need to be to mimic the tabletop experience.
ruin everyones day with flip table
Love the game. 10/10
this game is very good for the price as there is alot to do and the community overall is generally friendly.
"Pros -Awesome detail in games -Physics -The almost infinite amount of workshop items (A lot of common games and 'special edtion') -You won't feel the hours passing through -Awesome to play with friends -You learn about different board games -Sandbox abbilites (Throw the table, put different figurines, etc) Cons -It's boring if you play this game by yourself -Some minor bugs.  OVERALL: Buy it if you have friends to play with or if you don't mind playing with strangers."
I think this is what heaven looks like when a board game enthusiast dies.
"I am currently writing this review from tabletop simulator's tablet, this game is a million games in one and worth every cent."
I think this is what heaven looks like when a board game enthusiast dies.
"Amazing game with endless possibilities. I could play a DnD campaign, or play monopoly, or even secret hitler. It's fantastic."
Finally I can play all those lovely boardgames without actually meeting people - Nerdscore 10/10
Works great.
My favourite place to play every game neglected by developers who complain about copyright and piracy yet don't actually care enough to make a digital version of that game.
"This is a pretty good game simulator. With players able to recreate games in the workshop, the amount of games playable could be endless. I definitely recommend this game for anyone that likes playing board games, but have friends around the world that might also want a taste of different games from around the world."
"An amazing game. Favorite games- Secret Hitler and Setters of Catan. A must play board game of games. Good devs. Great community who are always willing to teach a game that someone taught them. Some gamer girls if your into that. Had some long nights with this game. Only real faults in this game i see are that sometimes lobbies don't properly show how many people are in. Sometimes having probleums connecting to them, and the infamous white board(not racist). But theses can be easily overlooked and a well deserving 9/10 "
A tabletop simulator where the sky (and technology) is the limit. Developers have listened to crucial feedback during Early Access every single time. Game is obviously enjoyed the most with friends but there are always other people hosting games for you to join with at least 2000+ boardgames due to its tremendous Workshop support.
its good
"Big shout out to the Devs, its one of the finest ♥♥♥♥ ive seen around for ages!!!!! You Are Awesome"
"Me and a few friends bought this during the winter sale awhile back, not really expecting much. Boy were we in for a surprise. If you enjoy playing board games, table top RPGs, card games, etc., you need to buy this. Virtually every board game you can think of is available through the steam workshop. My only complaint is that the controls/physics can sometimes be a little wonky, but you get used to them."
Like Garry's mod and a table had an illigitimate child. I like it.
Do you like board games? Do you not want to have to buy tons of physical copies and/or have no friends to play with in person? Get this!
"Have you ever thought to yourself 'Man, I really wanna play some board games with my buds but it's too late in the day, what should I do?'  Well, worry no longer you sorry sod! Introducing Tabletop Simulator! Now you too can fire up the game of life at 3am while being confused about what you did for your life to be at this point with a few of your already drunk mates, no transportation required!  Most board games too 'Mainstream' for your hipster ♥♥♥? No problem! It has mod support, make your own game and play it before it gets popular!  Best of all you dont have a mess to clean up after, just flip the table and be done with it.  3am drunk game of life / 10 (pretty good)"

Its a really good way to play board games with friends who live far away or gone home for the holidays. Also is really good for D&amp;D with workshop items.
I was here because the impossible game

"A must have for fans of tabletop games, like card games, board games, pen and paper RPG, etc.  This is a physics simulator. There is no rules implementation, you can script somethings to help run the game easier. But basically you will need to know the rules of the game you are trying to simulate. Just like on a real world game.  Also the Mod community is amazing. You can find almost any tabletop game on Steam Workshop.    Indispensavel para fãs de jogos de mesa, como jogos de cartas, de tabuleiro, RPGs de papel e caneta, etc.  Esse é um simulador de física. Não há implementação de regras, você pode usar script para ajudar a jogar mais facilmente. Mas basicamente você tem que saber as regras do jogo que está tentando simular. Assim como em um jogo no mundo real.  Além disso a comunidade de mod é incrivel. Você pode achar quase qualquer jogo de mesa no Steam Workshop."
if you love card games and board games this is utterly amazing!

"  Do you like Dungeons &amp; Dragons/Pathfinder/other table top RPGs? Do you like Cards against humanity, how about Poker? Do you like Chess, Axis and Allies, checkers, or other board games? Do you like rolling dice, drawing cards? Then this is the simulator for you!  On top of the premade simulator games (classics such as chess, checkers, and anything played with a deck of cards), the workshop has custom content that allows you to play a lot of popular games online with your friends. Great if you have moved away from all of your friends and are an akward weird person who hates meeting new people. This simulator is a digital tool box that allows you to play a multitude of games with your long distance friends so that you do not have to make new ones! "
Impossible game made me give this a positive review.
im playing the impossible game and have to leave a positive rating 
"The title is self-explanatory. If you can think of a boardgame, it's most likely on the workshop. Great fun with friends."
Impossible to play unless you act like HItler and kill all your friends Privliges.
This game is really enjoyable game for those who love board games and just want to relax or for people who just like to mess around in games like this.
"Great game, does exactly what you want it to, controls smoothly (and completely with the mouse if you so wish it), gamepad support is as good as it can get. Can't wait to try it in VR one day. Workshop content has everything you could want and more and the new updates always make it even better. 10/10"
"A great game if you're able to find a mod that works for you &amp; you run/loads decks &amp; or peices off of a local machine; don't try &amp; fetch them off the net in real time. If you try &amp; fetch any ifnormation in real time you will have the game stutter or just flat out crash! This game is VERY good for how customizable it is, if you can think of any board or card game you would like to play then this game makes it possible! I am not aware any player limitations for any boards/mods/tables but there might be. Over all this game seems to be designed to work on a 32 bit system &amp; not a 64 bit as the RAM useage displays a warning in game of capping at 3.2 GB before the game crashes. If you can pick this game up on sale for $10 or less then by all means do it, but don't bother paying full price for it or you will be sadly disappointed."
"Update (2017-01-02):  I can now recommend this game. You'll never guess what seemed to be causing the issue: Skype. Of all things, Skype on the other persons computer was causing issues with TTS. When they disabled it, the game worked proper (for the most part). I say for the most part because it wasn't complete smooth sailing but I can't blame the game for that :p  I'm sorry for keeping this review poor because of something so unrelated to the game itself. I would urge you to put this new finding in any issues threads you have so people who face the same issues can try the same solution.  Problem: games don't load/work when joining in multiplayer. Cause: Skype is on Solution: shut down Skype and use Steam, in-game or other voice communication solutions. For Skype, swap to web skype in browser in case you don't want to miss messages.  I absolutely love this game and I'm REALLY glad it's working now.  Again, appologies for not recommending it earlier for unfair reasons. I didn't know.  Now then, off to recommend it to more people so we can play an 8 player round of Eldritch Horror :p   ============================ Previous review:  I've read great reviews for this game and the first few times I've played by myself things went pretty great. The application loaded proper and the content also loaded and worked proper. No complaints whatsoever, would recommend.  And so I did, to several friends so we could play games together. I don't see much of a point in playing this on my own. They got their copies and the first round of a game I really like went perfect. Then the issues started and they've not gone away since: + Content doesn't fully load in one go, even for the host + Game freezes for other players + Super high lag making the game unplayable  Strange thing is is that the application seems to run proper for single player on all of their devices. It's multiplayer that so badly dies on them.  Hence, I cannot recommend this game until the multiplayer issues have been fixed. If you find my review to not be fair or downvote the game due to easily solved issues, please let me know! I want to play and like this game. First round was great! I want to solve the issues and give this game a 10/10 but if I cannot play with others I cannot recommend this game."
Good game tbh. didn't wannt to loose my gaem
secret hitler makes me cry cuz im jewish :-( but its a good thing i only play uno hehe xd
really like this game but wish my friends played it more i wanna play alot more board games hit me up ;3
10/10 You can watch hentais on ingame tablet or play porn puzzles

"Tabletop piracy made even more convinent. 10/10 love not paying for things.   I usually dont make joke reviews like this, but there is seriously nothing else I want to say about this game. The controls work, the community can be a bit toxic at times but is overall pretty fun to play in public lobbies or friends alike. The only reason this game is in my personal favorites is because it allows me to test out real life tabletop games without having to spend money on them right away. I ended up finding one of my favorite, casual strategy/chess variant games(Input) through the workshop. But yeah, the workshop contains about 95% total disregard for product copyright. You play this to pirate stuff, not to prototype new games like the developers shamelessly advertised it as early on. Please, if you play this game, and you have real life friends to invite over for a night of tabletop games, respect the people who gave you these concepts. Buy the physical games. Or at least buy the DLC and not the ghetto workshop versions of said DLC..."

There is a game called Secret Hitler.
"Honestly Tabletop Simulator is barely a game itself. But the games you can play within are almost limitless. I find this game very interesting, and I love it. The fact that you can get certain games from workshop is a great edition, because it gives the game more possibilities to play. And because of that, it serves endless fun. I love some of the workshop games too, because they can be real games that already exist, or a game created by somebody on the internet. Also you get to flip a Table. 11/10 would flip a table again."
The hardest part of this game is buying more copies of it to give to your friends so you aren't lonely.
"With $20 you have all board games. There is no more worrying about losing or damaging your expensive board game pieces. There is no more worrying about having enough room to play a particular board game. There is no constant requirement of setting up your board game to play it. There is no more having to clean up after a game. You don't have enough time to play? There is no more hurrying up to finish a game, just save it and play it later.  What I dislike is being forced to get out of the game in order to make my own custom models. In my opinion, 3D models should be made within the game, not with another program."
You can watch porn on the in game tablet. The sound even works. 10/10.  Alright for DND too.
"Best game ever, you can throw around cards/chessplates etc etc, 20000 / 10, buy now!"
"What can i say, this game is perfect. 10/10 IGN. THe only thing that would make this game 11/10 was if you could write a review for this game on the tablet."
Worth every cent. This game is exactly the definition of a ''well-programmed''-Game. Every Boardgame u can imagine is available in the workshop and the game is just flawless with no buggs or whatsoever!
cheggers party night
*Cat tries to flip the table... It fails...*  *Cat tries to flip table with psychic powers... It succeeds.*  10/10 Would flip table again.
"If someone can find the images for a card/board game, it can be remade here easily. Control is solid, even though it has physics. A true board game 'emulator,' a word that rhymes with this games only problem, the name. For the love of all things sacred, distance yourselves from the word 'simulator.'"
"I frequently host a Yugioh server since I don't really know how to play any other card game and I genuinely love the strategic gameplay, so you could imagine all the trolls that pass through and sarcastically say sht like  'Let's d-d--d-d--d-duel.' then proceed throw the cards everywhere."

"With mod support, Tabletop provides for your every boardgame need while straddling the line of legality with user-created versions of every boardgame imaginable, from Hyper-Dimension monopoly to Secret Trump Hitler. I can now play shadow hunters without having to actually see my friends' ugly mugs! :D  The controls aren't too bad too, when the ping is low.   8/10 would recommend."
Want to play monopoly with the ability to hide your anger or tears? Does monopoly result in ruined friendships and violence? Do you like playing games where you are encouraged to lie through your teeth and yell like an idiot 'Hes HITLER what are you doing' 20 times a second. Do you like fun?  Some games to look at if the above applies to you.  Secret Hitler Epic Spell Wars Betrayal on the house on the hill TIE fighter Wars 
"Didn't expect much as I getting this game; however, I ended up spending 11 hours straight on my first day inside this game as a host playing chess 4 man table, card against humanity, UNO and BS in that one server with different people that I don't even know their name."
"Oddly enough, this game is surprisingly good, with such a random concept you'd think it'd be gimicky trash, but it's not.  Not only can you choose from lots of different tables/games but the workshop content adds even more to the game and rarely do games not force you to get DLC, the game never shoves the DLC in your face or anything it's just passive about it, if you want to add that little bit extra to your experience you can get the DLC.  In fact this game has real life games in the DLC and workshop,  real  games, usually this costs much less (or a bit less) in DLC and it's completely free in the workshop, although I must admit the games are more fun in real life.   Although if you're looking for a game to binge play, I could not reccomend this less. You pretty much have to play in moderation, as concepts and games will eventually get lackluster and boring in most peoples eyes. Play it every once in a while when you're bored for an hour or two and you'll get over your moneys worth.  If you want to completely neglect the game you're playing you can summon in an Ipad, it's an Ipad but has the running speed of a 2014 computer and doesn't act wierd with certain ♥♥♥♥, it's basically Google Chrome!  Although multiplayer is consistent with children picking up the chess pieces, cards, etc and throwing them across the room, because they think they're funny! Although it does feel good and satisfying when you're not being a babysitting headache waiting to happen! It's usually one of the two extremes, nice people or kids who like ruining games.  You can also import images into the game and use them as backgrounds or prints on the table you're using! You can also do a huge jigsaw puzzle I couldn't get to work.  Although if you download a 'table', 'background' or 'piece/figure' off the workshop, it's always going to be a map, meaning you can't combine cool tables with cool backgrounds, plus, they're not really backgrounds or tables, just normal maps with ♥♥♥♥ added on top of it, meaning that you are going to experience a huge ass♥♥♥♥ of lag. With props you can't load them with specific tables because they're always on the default ones, because you can't load custom workshop props into the game!  Overall theres a lot you can do in the game, but it's very flawed in certain departments I'd reccomend it greatly, I beleive it is worth the price. I'd rate it a solid 8.5/10"

this game is 10/10 for just everything in it

Nice sandbox game.  This game can be explained like: 'Why do you have to be on computer all the time? Go to your friend and play some board games.' 'Mom. We are already playing them!'  Better for old-school players - you can play games which you played offline.

"I played it for a while but did not do a review. Thanks to this simulator I no longer have to buy tabletop games anymore. I get them for free. Know what? I even get to play multiplayer too. You can play everything, and if not almost all tabletop games aswell as custom ones. Totally recommended"

Everything you need to know about Tabletop Simulator and more!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvvbTm3bn-E 
impossible game told me to leave a review gg 10/10
"Tabletop simulator is an amazing game with nearly limitless potential. Whether you're making your own game, playing the classics or playing someone else's creation you're going to have loads of fun. Tabletop simulator provides you with a virtual sandbox to mess around with your friends on the internet. The game's online aspect is a really smooth experience, especially compared to many other games' online multiplayer. The only criticisms I have about the game is occasionally the controls can feel clunky and from time to time the rewind function is a bit inconsistent.  The game is amazing value, easily worth the money. I bought it on sale but I would easily pay full price for this game. I bought the 4 pack and I don't regret it at all. I highly recommend this game."
Only buy if you have friends to play with i have no friends
"Tabletop Simulator is a game where you are on a tabletop. people use Tabletop Simulator to play board games as shown in the screenshots, although most players use this Simulation just to 'Mess around' and play with the physics engine that Beserk Games has Used in this First-Person 3D Tabletop Simulation.  The Gameplay of Tabletop Simulator is very simple, But also flexible, Giving you a range of activities other than just playing board games Such as: Web-Browsing with Friends, Playing with the aforementioned 'Physics engine', And Creating random Objects with the supplied objects. One thing you must take into account before purchasing the game, is the replayability: The ability to replay the game multiple times comes down to one large factor, Multiplayer. The Multiplayer in Tabletop Simulator is possibly the only thing that makes it Fun, Without having pals to play with, It's just as fun as playing 'Monopoly' by your lonesome. I would Give Tabletop Simulator a Singleplayer Rating of: 2/5 And accounting for Multiplayer i would rate it: 5/5"
"Ever want to quit a game violently at the first sign of failure, without having to pick up the pieces? Now you can! You can quit any board game out there (on the steam workshop anyway) as violently as a table flip can be! Get it or die not knowing what it's like to flip a table without (many) repercussions."
"Played on club penguin in tabletop sim. Could also get banned through tabletop sim. 10/10, would get banned again"
"Gives you a reason to flip the table  Only game I've played got a lot more heated than IRL due to being able to lock things to the board  Otherwise, looks like a great concept"

"Hugely recommend this game.  TL;DR at bottom  I am a big fan of board games, but nowadays it's hard getting people who want to sit down for an hour and play one. Enter Tabletop Simulator. Every boardgame you can imagine, right at your fingertips.   The community is great. I have yet to encounter a troll or even a midly rude person. In other games I was extremely hesitant to try new gamemodes because people never explain them or ask questions because people never answer them. That is not an issue at in Tabletop Simulator. I haven't joined a game yet where people weren't readily willing to explain how to play. I can't praise the people surrounding this game enough.  TL;DR- If you are a board game lover you will adore this game. A biased 10/10."
I freaking love this game. You can pretty much play any board game using this simulator. I find it very enjoyable and find that the hours fly by while playing this game.

"Needs work. Servers are often slow and limited, there are some crashes, and worst of all:  THE CONTROLS FEEL VERY CLUNKY!  I'd give this game a 6.5/10 for now. It has amazing potential but it needs lots of work still."
"I cannot tell you how happy I am to have this. I am the proud owner of many tabletop games such as Netrunner, Dark of Winter, Legendary, and Doomtown Reloaded. It used to be that I could only play these games with my family but once a year while on vacation. Not anymore!  Thanks to Tabletop Simulator we can play anytime. And it truly deserves the world 'simulator' in its name. Much the same way a good flight simulator makes you feel like you're actually flying a plane, Tabletop Simulator makes you feel like you're truly sitting at the table with the cards and dice in front of you. Draw a card, flip it over, roll the dice, shuffle the deck, bump the table.  The only thing that would make this game better is Oculus Rift compatibility. Are you listening, game developers? :)"

"The ability to play tabletop games online with friends all over the world in a physics based eviorment is such a good idea, and Tabletop Simulator pulls it off perfectly. I find it diffecult not to recomend this to anyone interested in boardgames."
"The very best way to play any type of game with friends, that can normally only be enjoyed in the 'real world'.... ew. Outside is bad for you."
"This game is amazing. Not only does it give you basically EVERY board game for $20 ($10 on sale &amp; excluding DLC even though the DLC is very unique and TONS of fun), but you can make your own too very simply. And for anyone looking for more advanced tools, it also includes lua scripting for automation and really awesome concepts (like tron!). And you can do all of this online with your friends and IN VIRTUAL ♥♥♥♥ING REALITY where you can shrink down to the size of the minifigures and flip THE ♥♥♥♥ING WORLD (i.e. table). This is my favorite game of all time, and it has a shockingly low price for oodles (yes I said it) of fun. Just. Buy. It."
Much more fun than I would have expected
"Having only played a little under 4 hours, this game has already got me hooked! Being able to play board game across the internet with friends who are out of state is amazing. There's tons of games in the Workshop and being able to create our own is even better! Definitely recommended!"
"10/10 Spot on advertising, It simulates tabletops. Would have bought a 4 pack if it went on a 50% or more sale.  I hope they keep adding content for this, Id love to have a little dev kit to make animated figurines for example. Or if we could incorperate turns for DnD and other automatic sort of things we could script. Or if we could stretch/move the background pictures up and down so we could see the whole thing since the top half of background pictures get cut off, or that we could have a floor instead of things falling off into an abyss. More importantly I wish I could invite someone who didn't purchase it to my games, as sort of a guest or demo account~  As it is now though, its actually a really solid program... game?... and my minor gripes about it really are just minor and suggested improvements. I've been suggesting it to friends too, so I hope they keep improving it. :)"

The basic games are the usual card games/chess/backgammon/etc, but all the DLCs are high quality games. And there are countless games ported for this platform in the workshop! My only problem is the ui. It's really clunky and could use a more modern style. "

Cards Against Humanity/10
It's very spicy.
"Tabletop Simulator is the debut title by developer Berserk Games, a small indie company composed of two developers previously known for their “Mana Warfare” mod for Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. After being greenlit on Steam and raising over $37,000 on Kickstarter, Tabletop Simulator appeared on Steam Early Access on April 18. The game finally released on June 5, 2015, but still receives frequent updates and DLC releases.   The concept of Tabletop Simulator is simple – the game gives you a virtual tabletop and figures and allows you to manipulate them, giving you the ability to play all sorts of board games. The base game comes with classics such as chess and checkers, but the real meat of the game comes from the massive amount of user-generated content, such as board and card games, on the Steam Workshop. From Cards Against Humanity to Tabletop Mini-Golf, you will rarely find a game that the hardworking Tabletop Simulator community hasn’t ported to the game. The game features a very prominent multiplayer feature with up to eight players, including public and private servers. Although the community is very welcoming and you will rarely encounter trouble on a public server, the best way to play Tabletop Simulator is with a group of good friends.    While the graphics of Tabletop Simulator are certainly nothing special, the game definitely looks realistic. All of the official models and textures are very high quality, and a surprising amount the Steam Workshop assets feature high quality models and textures as well. The game is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux with impressive optimization for each platform. Although performance is normally outstanding, with very consistent frame rates even on low-end hardware, the game sometimes lags or crashes when too many objects are on screen at the same time, which can be a hassle if it happens during a multiplayer session. The game may also be memory-heavy when playing games with large amounts of pieces, which can lead to the aforementioned performance issues.   The gameplay in Tabletop Simulator is all based on the game’s impressive physics engine. Pieces collide and interact beautifully, with a variety of customizable physical properties such as gravity, weight, and material type. Players can utilize the game’s expansive toolset in order to hide cards in their hand, create secret areas that other players can’t see into, lock game pieces in place, resize cards or game pieces, and a large amount more. It certainly seems like the developers took every possibility into account when creating Tabletop Simulator – the game even has notecards that you can write on and a working tablet with access to the internet.  As stated previously, the Steam Workshop features thousands of community-created games, which means you can play almost every board game you can think of. However, since all Steam Workshop content is created by the community, many of the games do include works that have been copyrighted. While most real-life board game companies don’t seem to care, there are some legal issues with certain Workshop board games, which may prevent you from playing the games you want.    Anyone who is a fan of board games in real life should definitely give Tabletop Simulator a try. I especially like that it grants the ability to play board games, which normally require all players to be at the same location, over long distances. This makes it incredibly easy to organize board game nights with friends all over the world.   At the end of the day, Tabletop Simulator grants a very expansive sandbox full of board games to the player. Steam Workshop support makes the fun never end by allowing players to access an arsenal of thousands of popular community-created board games. The graphics are great, but the physics engine can easily become overloaded wish can lead to frame drops. Regardless of any occasional performance errors, Tabletop Simulator is a great game that achieves what it set out to do. Berserk Games definitely hit the mark with Tabletop Simulator. 9/10 "
"This is a great platform for board games with friends. The steam workshop feature really helps in this regard, hosting tools, objects and even full board games (whether homemade or (based upon) an existing one) on it.  I personally used it and will continue to use it to play D&amp;D and a whole lot of card games with friends*. Apparently it works with VR as well, which i never tried but i think that is pretty neat. Also, this is still under development, so bugs are being removed and features being added.  *WARNING: Friends not included."
I nominated this for The Game Within A Game Award. It's the only real option.
This game lends itself really well to a wide variety of hobbies and is accesible and easy to learn.

Although performance is normally outstanding, with very consistent frame rates even on low-end hardware, the game sometimes lags or crashes when too many objects are on screen at the same time, which can be a hassle if it happens during a multiplayer session. The game may also be memory-heavy when playing games with large amounts of pieces, which can lead to the aforementioned performance issues.   The gameplay in Tabletop Simulator is all based on the game’s impressive physics engine. Pieces collide and interact beautifully, with a variety of customizable physical properties such as gravity, weight, and material type. Players can utilize the game’s expansive toolset in order to hide cards in their hand, create secret areas that other players can’t see into, lock game pieces in place, resize cards or game pieces, and a large amount more. It certainly seems like the developers took every possibility into account when creating Tabletop Simulator – the game even has notecards that you can write on and a working tablet with access to the internet.  As stated previously, the Steam Workshop features thousands of community-created games, which means you can play almost every board game you can think of. However, since all Steam Workshop content is created by the community, many of the games do include works that have been copyrighted. While most real-life board game companies don’t seem to care, there are some legal issues with certain Workshop board games, which may prevent you from playing the games you want.    Anyone who is a fan of board games in real life should definitely give Tabletop Simulator a try. I especially like that it grants the ability to play board games, which normally require all players to be at the same location, over long distances. This makes it incredibly easy to organize board game nights with friends all over the world.   At the end of the day, Tabletop Simulator grants a very expansive sandbox full of board games to the player. Steam Workshop support makes the fun never end by allowing players to access an arsenal of thousands of popular community-created board games. The graphics are great, but the physics engine can easily become overloaded wish can lead to frame drops. Regardless of any occasional performance errors, Tabletop Simulator is a great game that achieves what it set out to do. Berserk Games definitely hit the mark with Tabletop Simulator. 9/10 "
"This is a great platform for board games with friends. The steam workshop feature really helps in this regard, hosting tools, objects and even full board games (whether homemade or (based upon) an existing one) on it.  I personally used it and will continue to use it to play D&amp;D and a whole lot of card games with friends*. Apparently it works with VR as well, which i never tried but i think that is pretty neat. Also, this is still under development, so bugs are being removed and features being added.  *WARNING: Friends not included."
I nominated this for The Game Within A Game Award. It's the only real option.
This game lends itself really well to a wide variety of hobbies and is accesible and easy to learn.
"All the board games imaginable through the Steam Workshop at your fingertips. But most importantly, you can play virtual Chutes and Ladders."
This game is awesome just an incredible amount of things to do and games to play. Thats why it needs to win the 'Game Within A Game' Award
is still pretty gud

"It is a really fun game, but only if alot of your friends buy it too. So, unless you have friends with the game, I wouldn't recommend it."
Amazing Sandbox Game!
"The game is pretty cool and allows for a great deal of customization. I found myself making custom stuff for my games to add to specific workshop games. You can create your custom everything if you don't want to use the workshop (for some reason).Great fun with friends on skype, avarage without. 8/10 would flip the table again."
"Lots of Games to choose from, runs very smoothly (expect you try to spawn everything that's available to spawn at the same time, then things can get pretty messy), very fun to play especially with friends on a boring evening and the Highlight is of course the option to flip the table in rage or just to annoy the hell out your friends 10/10"
I've always wanted to play games like monopoly and uno with my steam friends and now i can thanks to this amazing game. Also one of the few games to actually leave early access. 9.5/10 Dont worry you can disable the table flipping if your friends are cool like mine.

fucc me on a table
209/210 got to watch fisting porn with friends.  Oh and also we played blackjack.  But the best part was the fisting.
"One of the major gripes about being an online gamer and having online friends is that so many great games simply aren't around digitally. Most people won't fly someone in from Canada just to play a card game. There are other things too, like, say, figurine games and board games. And now, of course, we have this game to make up for that.  With this game, I think real life games have officially become obsolete. Tabletop Sim is EASILY worth the admission price, and a whole lot more.  A last thing before I post this review: This game also has 'tools' with various functionalities. Including 'tablets', which are essentially a   very real web browser, in-game.  If that doesn't speak volumes for the potential here I don't know what does."

Would love to see some games toss out some official DLC releases on here. Munchkin, for instance, would do very well (I see people constantly try to do the Steam Workshop on here not realizing/caring about SJG's copyright. Would also LOVE to see a Twilight Imperium board game DLC on here, although I know Fantasy Flight Games's copyright on it is almost as strict as Games Workshop.

"Truly a unique and expertly crafted piece of software. Giving the ability for players to enjoy table tops of all varieties across the globe from the comfort of their computer chair.  Honestly, I'll always prefer having friends over to share a game, but this has allowed me to play with old friends across the planet.   The community is thriving and the developers have put hard work and effort into this and don't seem to be slacking at all.  It does take a little time to work out how to play, but if you can't get friends over, get them online and have a blast!"

"Still not entirely sure how I feel about this game. In my experience I personally haven't seen anything quite like this game online. They give you a good selection of games, and they have some neat items like a functional iPad and MP4 player. Also the ability to make your own board games are a neat feature. The two main downsides are the community and the DLC. The DLC is a little bit too overpriced, and the addition of Steam Workshop support more or less makes these DLCs worthless, given there's so much extra things you can get off the Workshop. The community so far is horrid, with a few exceptions. Most of the time it's either games with a ban happy admin or people who are just screwing around. So if you have some friends to play the game with, then certainly get it. If not, then maybe just wait to get it on a sale."

Spend 2 hours to solve a cat puzzel.  Didn't finish.  Flipped the table.  10/10 would flip again  
-Went into an open lobby -Saw two kids playing with figurines -Felt like I watched an old pokemon episode -Joined and flipped table yelling 'GEODUDE USE SELF-DESTRUCT' -Banned from their pokemon game  12/10 would use geodude again.
"For everyone who's not sure about if you can play in multiplayer with people you don't know: Yes, you can.  Bought this game for 'Secret Hitler' and it is seriously one of the best games I've played so far in my life!  So even for that this gets a 10/10 and was worth the 15 bucks I payed for it (same would count for the regular 20 bucks).  + You can play a lot more games (which I didn't do yet as Secret Hitler ties me very hard).  Definitely gets a big recommendation from me."

"When I first saw this game I was really unsure. However, once I got into it I quickly learned that you really aren't purchasing a game. You really are purchasing many, many, many table top games in one. The standard game comes with the standard tabletop games. Checkers, Chess, Poker, Solatair, ect... However, with steamworkshop included you can get games like Muchinkin, Bang!, Risk, and many more. Overall it is a well put together simulator. I wish more of my fiends played it. However, I have made friends already though the sim.  Not to mention if you get put out with a game...Just flip the table and say F... It!!!"
"Awesome game, we play a lot of Epic Spell Wars... just make sure you disable table flip!"
"Do you like board games but lack the real life friends to play them with? This game is for you.   I mean, this even has Pokemon Master, that old pokemon board game...  Buy it, if you love board games or card games or what ever. I dunno. I'm not your real dad."
It works really well and you can play boardgames online. Practically any game.
I love this game so much! Every board game you could want for just 20 dollars. I plan on learning D&amp;D soon.
"So far I really like the game; I'm still learning the basics, but it is a very clever creation!"
Pros: flip a table play board games proceed to flip table get kicked by random guy host server guy joins and wants to play dominos spawns around 1000 dominos lags game flips table guy leaves others join and spawn random stuff throws stuff everywhere wait was this supposed to be informal screw that

If you don't like tables, don't buy this. If you you have a table fetish, then buy this. Its really just a tabletop simulator. I like tables and cards. So I bought this. :v"
"this is a great game if you want to simulate tabletops but i almost gave this a negative review due to the following  i am almost giving this a negative review only because wehn you flip the table, an option prominently and tantilizingly displayed during every game, the game board just falls into an infinite abyss which is a horrible purgatorily depressing background colour when you really have to stare at it. where is the ♥♥♥♥ing floor? my immersion bro :'(  pls add floor for pieces to bounce off when you have to flip a table then 10/10 "

"you have a table, its great"
"Tabletop Simulator is a game where you are on a tabletop, most people use it to play board games, this function is great as you can pick up your enemies pieces and throw them out of the universe. You can also be a complete troll and throw the table to disrupt the whole game and make the host rewind. This is great and all but clearly the best feature is the virtual tablet. There is a tablet in the game which is fully functional and works great for porn, now you can share all of your porn tastes with your friends! The tablet can be quite buggy but if you stick to pictures then you basically have a multiplayer porn streaming game. Due to this I give the game 9/10, if the dev releases an update which fixes the tablet for compatibility with more sites then I will be able to bump my score up to 10."
Played a game called 'Dont Get Aids'. I got aids.
"This game is simply amazing. I've been playing it for a solid 96 hours now, nonstop. Like, I even rebuilt my desk into a fridge/microwave/soda-dispenser/Icecream maker. Yes, that is how amazing this game is. If you have never played this so called 'Tabletop Simulator of destructive awesomeness,' then you suck at life. Don't make the mistake I had made before I heard of this game of not playing the game, and buy it right now. Like, literally now. DANG IT, IT'S NOT NOW ANYMORE!!! YOU FAILED ME, YOUR DOG, AND THE GIRLFRIEND I KNOW YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE. However, if you were to buy it now, I'm sure you'd have a girlfriend before you could say"

"For only $5(discount) you can get to play with a lot of games and with people over the net, better than actually buying a board game but the only advantage is that you can't play multiplayer if you don't have internet connection.

So good I wrote a review!
"Recommended for people who likes board game or has a friend who knows a lot about board games.  Most of the board game that I played in Tabletop simulator, I own them personally. Although tabletop simulator will never give the same feeling as the physical game, it enables me to play with my friends across the net.  Other than that, I also get to try out the game before decide to buy the game physically.  Mods recommended Funny and simple game - Love letter. Coop - Pandemic, Ghost Stories, Mysterium (deduction game), Xenoshyft, Eldritch Horror (for more complex gameplay) LCG/TCG - Pixel tactics, Ashes: Rise of Phoenixborn, Battlecon, LoTR(Coop LCG). Worker Placement - Tzolk'in, Lord of waterdeep. Solo play - Mage knight Notable Mentions - Specter ops, Dixit"
The best table flipper simulator in the game market.
"I love tabletop games, so it's no suprise that I like this one too. Buy if you love board games"
I cant turn it off... like i cant actually close the game. Well its closed but still counts as running... 
Ordered Dominos pizza through the in-game tablet.  It worked.  10/10.
Think of a board game. Any board game. You can play it. Eels and Escalators? Play it. Guess Who: Video Game Edition? Play it. Banana? Play it. Then proceed to flip the table as you lose at your favorite game to your friend.
"Good fun. Once you find a few good people to mess around with its a whale of a time.. thats assuming you were smart enough to play a boardgame involving a whale.   But serious the fact you can use a tablet in game to access the world wide webberverse and even post a review is pretty badass.   The only game con is lag that could use a fix but its tolerable and isnt so bad compared to some games its not like your are playing a shooter, the pieces of the board dont run away from you unless an ♥♥♥ flicks them or flips the table."
"Great game, allows me to create my own board game ontop of playing old board games I haven't played in ages or haven't been able to.  With the mod community providing great additions, this simulator will last for a long time and hopefully keep up the quality mods.  Been able to play with friends globally really makes this game shine."
We basically just drew ♥♥♥♥♥ all over the table. It was awesome.
There's a Pokemon TCG mod in the Steam Workshop.  151 / 10  gotta download 'em all
"spent 3 hours making an rpg about a frog-man that ♥♥♥♥ed his sister and a lizard-man who became a lizard through sex going on a quest to find the magical sword of pen-is. the frog-man (Kelfroog) doesnt have a brain and is controlled by his ♥♥♥♥♥.  10/10 like skyrim with frog-men  EDIT: joined an anime jigsaw puzzle server and played porn on their tablet, got banned instantly  6/9 like skyrim with angry anime people"
its ight
almost as much fun as sticking micro machines up your bottom. if u cant find something you like in the workshop then go get your micro machines out.
"This game is fantastic. i have recently bought it on the christmas sale and it was well worth the money, hell id even pay the 20 dollars for it because of how much use i get out of it. Tabletop Simulator is the perfect game if you like board games and i do mean almost any board game. With workshop support you and your friends can play games that you didnt even know exsisted. With a seeming endless supply of board games on the workshop and a great many different things to do with the base game it is well worth the money. So i most definitly recommend this game if you even only like monopoly or life it is still a great game to get because there are so many other versions of monopoly or life out there."

 Early Access Review
"Tabletop Simulator is a game about playing games. And what a job it does of that.  Whether you do or don't have any friends this game can be a blast. Exploring all the wacky options presented in singleplayer is fun, but pick-up-groups are very common and there are many communities online where you can meet up with like minded folk and hammer out some good ol' fashioned board games.  With a library that contains nearly every game you can think of and plenty of DLC releases that are very unique and fun you would be hard pressed to run out of things to try.   For those Die-Hard Tabletop RPG fans like myself, this game provides and excellent outlet for slamming creativity out and building maps in my free time for my players to play on.  Roll-20 STILL has TTS beat in the RPG department, but there is something wholly more interesting about rolling your dice, flipping cards, and messing with physics objects while you play. My players even take to stacking their dice occasionally (like they do in real life) so you know it simulates well.  All in all, during a sale it's only 10 bucks. If you like boardgames or want to get into boardgames, you cannot pass it up, even at its native price tag."
The best way to play board games without having to be near people. 4/20
This game is great for getting a group of busy people together to play some Roleplaying games or Board games. I've used this to get people who want to play with my group the ability to participate from their own homes. I love all the features and the dedicated Workshop content that has brought me back some old memories of games that don't exsist anymore.
I want to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of my friends now. Thanks Berserk.
Jolly good time mm yes yes jolly good
"Great simulator. You can play so many games with your friends (or other people if you don't have any friends).  Definitely worth to buy. This simulator is actually the best simulator despite all the other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You can also play Tabletop simulator with VR. Nothing else to say. 8,5/10"

Tabletop Simulator is a game where you can spawn a table then spawn any number of different board or card games to play with up to seven other people.
"Very good game, allows emulation of any board game imaginable and has support for advanced features. I really enjoy this game, though obviously it's not the type of game you'd play often as it basically requires multiplayer by the nature of board/card games. It also has support for DnD type things, but I don't know how to play DnD although I'd like to. By default you can play every basic board game - chinese checkers, checkers, go, chess, backgammon, mahjong, and even solitare. Workshop support means infinite possibility."
"only played it to mess around with it really, not much for playing games with others. BUT, worth every penny, the amount of games in there to play, worthit even if I can't play them properly"
Great simulator have not met any griefers yet so multiplayer is quite good :)
"-Gets invited to a nice game of chess -Goes through 5 minutes of the rules -I go first -I move my Knight -He moves his pawn -I move my pawn -He grabs all his pieces, chucks it onto my side, flips table and says in chat 'CHECKMATE ♥♥♥♥♥!'  10/10 great game - Lionsoda"

 Early Access Review
My Fav thing on steam. Evry board game in the world plus ppl to play them with for $20. Thats what i call VALUE. No longer do I have to put together and take down my games. Bought a 4 pack to force my friends to play and we are having so much fun. Thank you TTS. I love you.
Just a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ online drawing ♥♥♥♥♥ and swasticas while flipping the table.
Amazing if you already have friends. Amazing if you can get thouse friends to buy this. Amazing if you can then get them to agree on a time to play and then actually show up.  
Bought 4 pack for my community and having tons of fun so far. Highly recommend it to anyone wanting to play some tabletop games
"If you enjoy tabletop games this is a must have. It actually works really well and the Steam Workshop has tonnes of different games in it.  I kind of feel like the marketing and naming of this game lets it down somewhat. It gives off the impression that this is some wacky physics sandbox with boardgame pieces when it isn't. Check out some Twitch streams or Youtube let's plays to see that this is actually a very complete and worthwhile package.  Also the VR mode is pretty awesome, albeit a little impractical for actual games.  Oh and one other thing. This game has allowed me, for the first time, to actually enjoy tabletop games. I have very bad eyesight so I generally declined offers to play IRL tabletop games because I have difficulty reading the cards or seeing what's on the table. This application makes it possible for me to actually play the games I'd been missing out on."
Does what it says on the tin. VR support is super neat even in its unfinished state. I scaled myself way up and my friend scaled himself way down and I got all up in his face and scared him and it was great.
I can say with full honesty that this is one of the few games made  better  by DLC. There's not a whole lot else to say about it. The dev has done everything he said he would. He's done tons of reddit AMAs and runs the subreddit. He's also stickied a suggestion form.
"its good idk i dont remember like everyone else that's not playing dnd in it, i only played it a couple of times with my friends but hey those couple of times were fun yo"
"Really easy to use and well worth the price , many different games to ad to the simulator"
Nazis vs Jews simulator 10/10
Geatest boardgame simulator you can play any tabletop game you can think off and more it has it!!

If you have any interest in tabletop games this is a great game to have. You can find plenty of people willing to jump into a game and just have a go if you dont have any friends. If you do have friends then its even better.

 Early Access Review
Fun if you want to throw game pieces at your freinds becasue thats all thats going to happen.
hours of fun. every game you can think of i spend hours playing 21 or monopoly and if all fails you can flip the table
"I figured it would be impossible to get in an actual game with someone but its not really that hard, its also not the hard to just ♥♥♥♥ around and throw everything around, so its a pretty fun game, even better if your friends have it aswell, but public lobbies arnt that bad. It has alot of games in the workshop, alot that ive never even herd of, so you will pretty much never run out of stuff to do in this game, definitly worth buying."
I got sick of playing against cheating chess AI that I can't call out on their shenanigans so I got this to play with friends instead. The fact that it comes with modding potential is just icing on the cake. The only thing this is missing is companies making official versions of their games for this as paid DLC.
"Initially playing some board games virtually can be suprisingly frustrating. Once you have passed the initial hurdle of learning the UI and control system you will find an intuitive engine with an almost unbelievable amount of content provided through the steam workshop and community developers.  Grab a couple friends, pick your favorite board game (even ones that are out of print! i'm looking at you, space hulk) and have a blast."
10/10  start the game play a game of chess lose horribly flip the table exit
"This is really fun to mess around with when you get it with some friends. Lots of cool mods too adding real-life board games and many other things. A very sandboxy, well, tabletop simulator. Like I said though, be sure you have some friends, as it can get easily boring if it's just you (although I'm sure you can find all sorts of things for singleplayer card games on here too if you really wanted)."
"So i have played a few hours of this game and here is my take on it:  Likes: - Its really fun with 2 to 8 people.  - There are MANY different games on here - Always something to play with someone - Physics and the like make it enjoyable to just roll dice - Flipping tables  Dislikes:  - Some controls are hard to use - Some people just ruin games and quit - Most playable servers are un-populated - Rules are generally not displayed - Usually only find one good group of people every now and again  Would i suggest this game to people? For the $20 they ask... no, not really. If it goes on sale or if a few friends pitch in for the 4 pack then yes. Its a fun game and you get plenty of play out of it but just like all board games, this becomes kinda boring and if you are anything like me (Fairly low attention span) then you wont get much play unless playing with people you know.  Hope this helped. Happy Gaming"

Why would you spend money on pokemon online TCG booster packs if you could just get this game for 20 bucks and pirate the entire standard and extended format from  pokemon.com?   Same goes for many other games.
Trying to play UNO with friends. Someone spawns in a tablet. Starts watching harcore porn. 420/69 would UNO again.
Brilliant. No longer I have to deal with those awkward social situations that may occur when playing board/card/etc. IRL games.
You can flip the table.
Table Flip Simulator 2015  11/10 Would flip tables in real life again.
"Im too weak to flip the table, YOU UNDERESTIMATE MY POWER 10/10 Would Flip Again - IGN"
"It's really dependant on the quality of the mods you are using, but there are a lot of great free mods in the workshop, and if you love board games then this is easily worth the price."
  I find it to be quite fun with friends.
Countless Hours of table flipping fun. And in the end hating your friends and wanting to scratch their eyes out to the point of no return and have them go through countless hours of torture methods and feeding them their own feces with a spoon after ripping open their mouth in order to force feed them while blood spewes from multiple places.   10/10 - Would Kill Friends Again.
"Great game, great community, nearly endless possibilities on what to play in the workshop"
Love playing Magic with friends on here however wish it was alot easier to use with a finger tracker on laptop ... mouse required
"Has a Lot to offer with all of the possible mods avaliable.  However, it is much more fun to play with friends than random strangers, and I would probably not have bought this if none of my friends has bought it. It is well worth it IMHO, being able to play almost any tabletop game for under $20 has me sold."

"Do you like board games of all shapes and sizes? Get this game, and tell your friends to play it with you."
7.8/10 too much server bans aside from that the physics engine is good
"A few years ago, a small indie game team known as Wolfire took on the 'F*** THIS JAM' challenge and made a game in a genre they hated in seven days. The result was  Desperate Gods , a brilliant board game like a fantasy-themed Chutes’n’Ladders. They control almost exactly alike. So, TTS, don’t think I don’t know where you saw this first.  But Tabletop Simulator does everything better. The basic idea of a simple multiplayer lobby that you can spawn manipulatable objects into works great, and the Workshop support makes it.   You can play anything.  Period.  Dot.  End of story.  If it exists, someone has added it or is adding it to the workshop. Or you can. It does not matter, it will be done. And then you can drop into a game, the GM can spawn in stuff, and you can all start playing “Cards Against Humanity Star Trek Edition.”  I learned how to play three new games I did not know existed the first day I fired this thing up. I’ve hosted pick-up games of D&amp;D and Go.   It’s all there, it’s all available. Everyone needs this in their library, this is a game on par with Garry’s Mod in value. Buy once, play forever."
"You'll never have to buy another board game, or go to mini-golf, or get an air-hockey table, or go bowling (the list goes on.) Ever again. This game is one of those games where you sit down and just play a nice game of chess, or poker, or bowl, or maybe you're an Uno kind of guy? Maybe you hate board games with a passion. Get on a tablet. You can browse the internet, and do what you do on the internet. Just be sure to have a friend to play this with. Not too many good servers out there."
"An amazing game. Bought it out of boredom, and have developed likings to new games, and had new friends, and experiences all through a single game. Mechanics work well, wide array of workshop addons, and easy use makes this game worthwhile!  Definately recommend!"
"Table flipping simulator. 11/10 - IGN. Would buy again  In all honesty the game is OK. Sometimes can decide to be laggy, others just fine. Just about any card game can be found on the workshop, providing hours of fun wiht friends. Just make sure you turn off table flipping."
It's fun when you want to play and aren't dead inside.
"In Early access, this game was almost complete. Now it's released and is AMAZING. If you can snag this on sale or even buy it at full price, you will get your money's worth."
"A board game fanatic's paradise, Tabletop simulator is an excellent game to pick and play with friends and even make some new ones, and is held up strongly by it's modding community!"
"Developers and creators, thank you. This is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing."
Friend uses it to watch his porn 10/10
"Good game to play with friends! I love the DLC Superfight worth the $20 so my friends and I can play. Many great games. It needs better UI. 7/10 base game, 9/10 DLC."
Super fun game that I wouldhighly reccommend.
"well optimized, Solid physics and alot of fun. If you like to make stuff there is lots of room for that too with importing custom models and such. I highly reccomend it (P.S it kinda ripped of desperate gods  http://www.wolfire.com/desperate-gods) "
The game of games
"If I could only have 1 game on Steam, this would be it. This, plus community workshop."

"Probably one of the best 'bang for your buck' games on steam. With the buy in price you get access to the mod community which is very alive and hard working on converting board games, card games, and table top RPGs to the system. There are so many great table top games that you can play for free with this including Battlestar Galactica, Betrayal at house of the hill, Dead of Winter and many more. Fans have also added in many card games including The Witcher 3 gwent, Final Fantasy 8 triple triad, and of course cards against humanity. The amount of table top activities you can achieve with this game are amazing and its far easier sometimes to find a game online than IRL due to time constraints, money issues, and simply not wanting to set up and dismantle most large games. I recommend this system to anyone interested in tabletop games in any shape or form be they RPGs, board games or card games. "
Currently IN-GAME writing a review from the tablet game. Cannot play the game in the browser though :c 9/10 Would not play Tabletop Simulator inside of Tabletop Simulator ever again
"With the endless options, in both customizations but also different boardgames, this game offers, it's a MUST HAVE for any fan of tabletop games. Plus it offers cross platform gaming as well."
I made my own Hearthstone with balance and more cards than the original game!  That's awesome and kinda sad at the same time!
"Only played this for a few hours, but I must say; flipping a table has never felt so good.  On a serious note, I'm probably gonna play the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game, because as a tabletop nerd; it is my duty to waste quality time on digitalized versions of my favorite table games."
I wrote this review while using the tablit in the game. 10/10 would flip agian.
"Amazing game, can play basically any board game, supports modding. All the mtg cards for 20 bucks I'll take it"
Great thing to habe
Loads of fun with friends!

"literally the best thing to come to tabletop gaming since monopoly  you can play LITERALLY ANY BOARDGAME, WARGAME OR CARDGAME CONCEIVABLE the game isn't in it? check the workshop, chances are it's there if it's not there? you can import ALL of the models into it for free, save it, and use the models whenever you want (OR, better yet, put it on the workshop for others to use!) hell, you can even SCRIPT the board so that you can skip annoying turn mechanics or stuff like that!  so basically, you're buying literally every single boardgame/wargame/cardgame ever made (or that ever will be made) all for twenty dollars. less, if it's on sale."

"This is the best board game simulator you could buy. The game is supported by the community with the Steam Workshop, which means an infinite amount of board games you could play (as long as there's someone to create them). The controls are smooth and easy to learn, making the game a pleasure to play and the graphics and physics are just great. You too can create board games for Tabletop Simulator, no need to get SDKs, you make the board game inside the game, the way you want it. Not only there's an easy tool that lets you create decks just by dragging and dropping pictures into the tool, but you can also import custom models into the game.  So what are you waiting for? get the game, like, now."

"Definetly worth $10.99. It's a lot of fun and I think I could pour in tons of hours of fun gameplay with some friends who don't live nearby me. The workshop has tons of fun and original content, incuding games that exist in the real world."

You got Dungeons and Dragons, Life, Guess Who, Dead of Winter, Magic the Gathering, Pokemon, and a LOT of other games you can play.

Great fun; a virtual playground with seemingly endless possibilities... and so many classics in the Workshop already!
"I bought this expecting an AUTHENTIC experience simulating going to an actual board game society, and I couldn't have been more dissapointed.  While the games DOES have board games, it DOES NOT include:  1) Most of the other players being obese. 2) Pieces of games that are missing/sticky/covered in some kind of sugary drink. 3) Rampant manchildren.  So while you CASUAL gamers will surely enjoy this, as a PRO LEVEL board gamer I must say this does not simulate the accuracy of playing a board game and must sadly not recommend this game."

Simply amazing it's like a candy store !
This is the best game to rage quit when playing poker or cards against humanity (thx to workshop support)
its super neato when you are not watchingg furry porn with strangers while red is in the bathroom
I love this game! The possibilities are endless and the selection of games in the workshop is huge!  I can recommend this game to anyone who likes tabletop games at least a little bit. Even something as simple as doing a jigsaw puzzle or playing a game of Memory with a friend are a lot of fun.
"Fantastic platform allowing easy access to any board game you could wish for, from classics to modern day games. I've sunk so much time in this game and enjoyed all of it. (Aside from the sheer volume of blackjack, Secret Hitler and Poker game sin the lobby xD)"
Played a game that wasn't out yet. 20/10 
Cool game.
"An excellent simulator of what playing games at a tabletop is like, complete with the ability to flip the table in disgust at how dumb your opponents are. There are a few issues here and there but aren't impactful enough to the moment-to-moment experience to bother listing. Overall, a well designed base package with both paid and workshop DLC to allow for a near-limitless amount of fun and enjoyment."

Perfect for a group of friends who just want to relax at a table and play some Pictionary or Risk. The possibilities of the board games are endless just as long as it's not mechanical like mouse trap.   The physics are great and adjustable, the controls are good once you get used to it, and the performance is really good for a game that relies on physics.  Overall it's just a fantastic title to play with friends. If you love the idea of being able to play board games with friends that live nowhere near you then this game is most likely in your shopping cart."
"This game provides a way to pass the time with your friends that are far away in a way that you could if they were right next to you. There are plenty of games built in and a plethora of custom games on the Steam Workshop. So far, I havn't even scratched the surface."
"This is a great game that allows you to play any board game imaginable with anyone who owns the game (or even on the same computer). If they don't have a board game you like, you can even make and import your own boards and cards!. Or, break out of your comfort zone and try something you might have never seen yourself playing! This game has proved to be a lot of fun among my friends, if only we had more time to play together... This is as close you will ever get to player a board game on your computer, it even incorperates gravity! I would suggest buying this game to anyone who may even be on the fence about the game due to the huge pool of games to choose from (for free!). A lot of games + expansions cost hundreds of dollars, but here you can get them all for just paying for tabletop simulator! A must buy for an board gamer, or nerd!"
simulates tables perfectly  unfortunatly there always seems to be a board game on top of them or cards
"I've never had such a reversal of opinion about a product. I thought it was a weird idea that I had no interest until I saw the sheer volume of content, it all works, it works well, and it's INFINITE. With a little knowhow and the right parts, it's possible to do anything from play a round of cards, a board game with some friends, or even playing a pickup game of DND. Good stuff! Plus having INFINITE pieces makes anything possible.   The biggest complaint though is you choose from several table models and there's no way to make a super huge table or change the dimensions, but that's hardly a problem compared to all the stuff it offers."
"Fantastic game system. Whatever game you want to play, if it's a board or card game, this can most likely do it.  Easy to set up, tons of mods.  Only negative is the DLC Ultimate was added for $20, then went on sale the next day for $10. HOWEVER, that doesn't detract from the rest of the package.   I'm using it to play games with family that are over 2,000 miles away, playing games we own physical copies of, but can't get together to play in real life without a super expensive plane ticket!  "
got forced to by the game
"Epic fun, Lot's of Workshop content. Just gather some friends and go play lots of great tabletop games."
"This is exactly what it says it is, and there is nothing you can't do with it. I can't imagine a reason to complain about this simulator. If you haven't bought it yet, you're missing out. Also, Cards Against Humanity.  10/10, would flip table again. It was wearing shiny oak, so clearly it was asking for it."
Initially I thought this would be a flop but after playing around with it I found it to be very intuitive and easy to use. With all the updates the guys have been putting into this it's just gotten better and better. I can't wait to see what else they implement in the future.
Play board games with this computer program.
tip top tabletop
"It's a good game but you need friends. No, i'm not gonna play with you."
"Great game to play with friends. Also has almost any game you can think of, whether a card game or board game."
"The steam workshop makes this game worth it. Play any board game with friends, with easy to learn controls. Would highly recommend for the tabletop gaming enthusiast!"
Does what it says on the tin and more.
"Tabletop simulator simply rocks, if you like any tabletop or roleplaying game and you use a computer then it is highly recommended!"
Great for playing any card/board game with friends. You can even make your own games!
uno ruins friendships
i can watch pron on the tablet 10/10
I can say with confidence that I have never played a game for so long and still enjoy it every day. This game will allow you to meet many friends. I believe that paying twenty dollars or lower on sale for many fond memorys of playing tabletop games with friends is worth it.
"You can do so much with such a simple idea, If you like any board game then this game will be worth the price."
Best feature is to flip the table
"Cant find a old school game you rember playing, YOUR NOT LOOKING HARD ENUF. Has damn near every boardgame i could want to play and if not someone usally ports it in :D whooooo"
1. get friends 2. download 'Cards against humanity' mod 3. profit
Im doing for the badge
it is very nice. especially great for trying out a game before buying it
"I have spent almost 170 hours in this simulator, learning different games and killing hitler. I also met a lot of super cool people - strongly recommended!"
A game that helps you organise board game sessions. What more do you want?
A spectacularly good value game if you want to play board games but don't have any nearby friends!
"You can do practically anything you can on a real tabletop with this game. Pretty much any board game imaginable can and probably has been ported to the workshop. You can play your favorite card games, board games, and tabletop RPGs online, so you don't even need to all be in the same country, or even know each other. The devs are constantly updating the game with things like scripting API and Vive support. For such a cheap package, this game just keeps getting better and better."
"At first I was all like, woah, the physics in this game are really fun to play with!  Then I realised that the physics engine just simulates sitting round a table, playing games with your friends.  Then I realised that... HOLY ♥♥♥♥, I LOVE PLAYING BOARDGAMES WITH MY FRIENDS THIS IS THE BEST THING EVERRR"
this is an amazing game and well worth the money  8/8 m8
What an amazing game playing cards against humanity secret hitler and hundreds of other games with my friends its super fun but if its with cool people or friends :D
"VR Review-----  This software is straight up totally worth the cash. I've been looking for ages for a game - ANY game that I could play through VR with my poor, Vive-less friends. This game delivered the heck out of that. The cross-platform possibilty is fantastic because it allows me to feel like I'm actually sitting at the table while playing with buddies.  I think one of the things that I appreciate most is how this game was originally a non-VR game that has been out for a while. This allowed for the Steam workshop to grow huge and give the game ample amount of content compared to most games on the Vive right now.  If you have a Vive, don't be afraid to buy this. The game feels like it was made with Vive in mind (aside from the terribly low res-backgrounds). There is immense satisfation to playing this game, and it's totally worth the cash.  One thing I would want to see changed is some kind of alternate model for people who don't have a Vive. They can see me and my hands, but for them, all I see is an icon, and it shatters my immersion in the game. If the game could tell when a Vive player is in a server, and gave all non-vive users some kind of model to make their avatars look like other people with Vives, that would make the experience a lot more immersive and amazing."
"A great game. Good for board games, trading card games, and even RPGs. Really nice/interesting community."
buy one game and own hundreds
this is honestly one of the most useful games i have ever owned for what i do nowadays. i fully recommend it to anyone with a internet community it provides so many hours of fun
A game within a game o.o

"If you like card games and board games, this game is destined for you. 10/10 Great modding community too"
Great fun; a virtual playground with seemingly endless possibilities... and so many classics in the Workshop already!
I wrote this from the tablet.... Am I able to play this on the tablet......?
"the tables present feature tops of varying sizes from big (for board games such as 'Punch the Cat' and 'Who instiutionalised Grandma again?'), medium (for RPG's including 'Honey I ♥♥♥♥ed A Halfling' and 'Hide the Sausage') and small (intended for smaller, family games like 'Operation: Breast Augmentation edition' and 'Self-Harm: The Game of the TV show!')   it also made me wife leave me"
"Honestly, this game is amazing for groups of friends. Tsuro, Fiasco, Settlers of Catan, Secret Hitler and Spyfall are easily my favourite games.  Highly recommended."
1st game that lets you be hitler and enjoy having fun with friends at the same time. 9/11 would gas again
"Are you tired of interacting with people directly? Don't you wish that you could play games that require human interaction without all that pesky speaking to one another? Try this game here. You can have as much fun as you would with a night at grandma's without the grandma.  Flip that table, boy. I won't tell."
You can build puzzles of Guy Fieri with friends
"A lot of fun to play with a group of friends online, there is a near-endless amount of content to enjoy."
"You can find almost any boardgame you want. The one you wanted to play is not there ? Make it and upload it in the workshop, or look up for the games other people made and find new favorites ! Or download the stupuidiest object from the workshop.  So fun to play a new game or a one you know and love on multiplayer you don't see the time pass by."
A very good simulator that allows you to play pretty much any board game you can imagine with local or online multiplayer. What's not to like?
"Great with friends, or by your self.  I love board games, and I love that I have all my favorite games here on TTS. It's a great place to learn new games too"
Secret Hitler Simulator 10/10 would buy

A game within a game o.o
"Tabletop Simulator is a fantastic game. I use it to GM some Tabletop RPGs with friends whom it would be either impractical or impossible to meet with in person. It has allowed for countless hours of glee, of terror, of joy, and of agony. It's led to all of us laughing uncontrolably, and it's led to every single one of us pleading with the dice gods to spare our character's lives. Due to the nature of these types of games, this game has potentially limitless value. The game comes with some basic preinstalled games, like chess and whatnot, but that's not where the joy lies. The joy lies in the Workshop, where you can find everything from big-names like Mansions of Madness and D&amp;D to things made exclusively for the TTS Workshop. I wholeheartedly recommend this game IF you have friends to play with. I am fortunate enough to have a wonderful crew to play with and who have an interest in a large variety of games. If you are looking for a singleplayer experience, or if you are looking to matchmake (which is possible, but I would highly recommend against), you should look elsewhere. But if you have even a few friends with Steam who you'd like to play some tabletop games with, Tabletop Simulator is the go-to place to be."
Overall a great way to play games with your friends that you havent played in a while. Not as fun by yourself :(
Really fun.🐑 
Simply amazing it's like a candy store !

"What about some chess? Even better, a game of poker? Without actually having to be with that person physically?  Check this out!"
Great game for messing around with friends
Its a game for playing games with your friends that aren't there!
Physical board games are always going to be better but physical board games are expensive and there are very few ways of trying the game to see if you'd like it before your purchase. Tabletop Simulator is perfect for testing games out that you're not sure you'll like.
"A great way to try board games before buying them, meet a lot of people, participate in playtests or even develop your own games!"
There's only really a handful of games you can't play online that you can with Tabletop Simulator. But you can flip the table and throw game pieces around so it's whatever.

"This is a great game , but kind of missing the AI, because not everybody wants to sit around and play with others all the time. other than that I Highly recommend this game because it has all of your favorite board games for it."
"Tabletop Simulator is a dream come true for any who loves board games, card games, and you just can't get family and friends to play with you, or your gaming community is spread out around the world. Dev support is amazing!, they're always around testing, fixing things. If you're a creative person, you can easily make your own games and upload them, or you can bring new life to that old out of print board game you've had in your closet for years. There is also DLC with some of the most popular and current day board games. There are so many ways you can enjoy this sim tool, it's a must buy for any board gamer/card gamer."

"As someone who never played this before, I bought the 4-Pack so I could share with my friends. I have not been disappointed yet. You get to pretty much play any game from your childhood. Uno, Sorry! Guess Who, Battleship, The Game of Life, and so much more! The game has a bunch of simple games like Chess, Checkers, Reversi, and Solitare built in, but the rest are mods. I don't think there is a game I've not found on the Workshop.  Now, I've owned this game for about a week now and I recently developed my very own RPG Dungeon Crawler. The tools I used to build it were very simple and easy to understand. I was able to complete this massive game in 13 hours straight. Now it's almost been 3 days since release and it has 120+ Subs and 300+ Unique Views. Many more than I anticipated!  Here's  my mod! :D  Tabletop Simulator is a game that should have been thought of about a decade ago. Probably a game I won't over-play anytime soon! You did a great job, Berserk Games!  I'd recommend getting this game especially on sale, but for how massive this game can be, $22 is a very fair price!"

"You're probably hyped as balls by the trailer, but wondering how viable online multiplayer is with strangers. It's good, don't worry. You can find a game to join within 10 minutes.   I'd recommend fast games like Coup, Bang!, or Love Letter, because things go a bit slower in this game vs real life."

"If you're a Tabletop/Board Game fan, this is an aboslute must have. It's pretty much the coolest thing ever.   It is what it says, it's just a Tabletop Simulator. It can simulate just about any game you can play on a table. It allows customization, but does not add any game rules and is completely freeform."

Only game I've really cared about in the Early Access program, and I'm glad to see them come out of it. This game is worth every penny I spent, and it's still worth it at the higher price, now that they're out of Early Access.  Keep up the good work, devs!"
I watched a short game of blackjack and played a lovely and pleasant game of Cards Against Humanity (if you ignore the German porn on the tablet). Honestly an amazing game which will revolutionalise board games. Highly recommended!
"Infinite amount of games, Infinite amount of fun &amp; Infinite amount of flipping tables.  1/0"
I like this game because you can do anything.  Literally.
"this game is perfect, since i don't have any friends around me i can't play tabletop RPGs such as pathfinders or DnD, on day 1 of having this i met some awesome guys and can now play their virsion of hero quest with this. Cheers for the creators for making it possible to play board games with people at long distances"
"This was gifted to me by a good friend from a 4 pack they got for us to play Dungeons and Dragons, we've ended up using it to play Magic the Gathering, and mostly Cards Against Humanity. My friend stands by it being money well spent and so do I. A great simulator to play with friends when you all no longer live in the same city. I'd recommend the frak out of this. The possibilities are limitless."

"This game is trully amazing. It is recommended to have a bunch of friends because it will make this game the best co-op experience. Anyway let's get down to the game. Rather than a game itself, think of it as a gateway to thousand of games. Spanning from simple board games like monopoly or poker to more complex ones like D&amp;D and Warhammer. What makes this game more lively is the control you have over the table. You can move and interact with every piece of the game you have chosen and not only that but it gives you the freedom to do whatever you want with that. More like real life rather than a hold-your-hand experience. Be creative if you want: do you want to create a board game but you couldn't just find the objects for that? Don't worry. The game will give you more than enough things to make your ideas into a reality. -Beware, creative mind is a must for this-. Workshop: That is where you will find most of the games you want to play, be it old time classics or modern games. I was surprised to even see the old Pokemon board game, which I used to play a lot when I was younger. Simply 10/10"

"Just think about all of your favorite board games. Think about all the fun times you have had with your friends. With Tabletop Simulator, you can have all that and more. You have a wide variety of tools at your disposal, you can play with friends basically anywhere you are, and you can even download games you've never played before from the Steam Workshop.

"Probably the best game I ever bought over Steam to play with my friends. Right now I got eight copies. One for myself and my core group of friends. We play DC Deck Builder games, Fluxx, Cards against Humanity and so forth the game list because of the community is vast and unending. Are only real gripe is what's up with the table sizes. Seriously needs another size up size wise. Might be in the game and I just don't know how to fix it yet that being said.   The big thing here is we play a lot of tabletop games when we see each other as a group but since we all live in different places now. That and some of the games, heck most of the games you can play here are super freaking expensive. When you break down how much some of these games cost in real life and compare them to this. This game ends up actually saving you money in the long run. I really can’t recommend it enough. Only other gripe is the four pack can’t be bought as a gift thus I had to pay more to buy the extra copies I bought during the Winter sale for four other people (You can buy it one time, get three gift copies but once you own the game you can’t do it again), found that to be slightly odd.   Otherwise couldn’t be happier about it.   10/10   Highly recommended, even at full price! "

"Do you like board games? Do you like items that could choke you? Then this is the game for you! With the new Advance Board Game Simulator, you can have all the fun of a board game! Just without any friends... cause you don't have any. Oh, and the pieces won't choke small children! Because the pieces are put in a virtual reality on a screen. So, they're basically fake. But whatever! Get this game if you really want to play some board games on a system that is made to make board games not be on boards! Have a fun time with your new Advance Board Game Simulator.  Overall Score: 8/10"

Loads of fun. I love the recreational games made by both the devs and community. It's really just a fun board/card/iPad simulator. I'd say it's worth a buy if you want to play board games with your friends.
Play any board game you want with your friends. 10/10
Truely a great game with friends
"Let me tell you a story.  My friend, who went to a particular parade, wanted me to buy this game. He liked people of both genders. So I figured if I didn't get this game, he would no longer love me. So clearly, I bought this game and we played it. I am not gay. He got the assumption I was. So, when he wanted love triangle to be a game, I quickly knew it was my duty to forever hate this game. It was no easy task however, as this game has many fun aspects and will have you and your friends laughing for hours."

"Tabletop Simulator is a simulation game [duh] that gives you access to play many tabletop and board-based games [double duh]. The game comes with a variety of classic board games- Chess, checkers, backgammon, etc.- as well as a Jigsaw feature, a few card-based games [including a completely manual version of Solitaire] and a suite of pieces for D&amp;D-style tabletop games. On top of that you have 8 officially-supported boardgames available as DLC, and a Workshop where the community have added and continue to add pretty much every tabletop game, boardgame, card game and dice game that has ever been created.   So when you buy a copy of Tabletop Simulator, you are essentially getting free access to every and any game that doesn't need a computer... on you computer. Ever wanted to play a friendly, immersive game of Chess with one of your internet friends overseas without having to get out your chair? Ever wanted to lose ALL your internet friends by kicking their asses at Monopoly? Ever wanted to fip a table after an argument over the rules to UNO without the worries of cleaning up afterwards? Have you ever wanted to play Texas Hold'em, but felt that real poker sets had a distict lack of anime fanservice? Or maybe you just want to make new friends who are into Secret Hitler as much as you are? If you said yes to any of that, the this game is for you!   Although I will say this- if you want this game, definitely wait for the sales. I mean you COULD pay £15 to get a copy for yourself and then pester your friends to buy the game, or you can wait for the sales and buy a 4-pack for £22.50 [ish] and just give your friends the other 3 copies. I'd also recommend looking over the Workshop before buying this game, just to double check they have the games you and/or your friends want to play. There's a 95% chance [give or take] that it's there, but y'know... piece of mind and stuff...  Why are you still reading this? Go get this game already! Even when it's not on sale, £15 for every boardgame ever is a pretty sweet deal- considering most of them in real life cost £20 on average."
"You can spawn an iPad, put ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on it, then spawn an MP3 Player and play Rock on it, while playing poker. If you lose at Poker, you can just flip the table.   Best Game."

This is a MUST buy for any board game enthusiasts. It's great to be able to play just about any board game with your friends online instead of having to wait to meet up in real life. It's also a good way to try out board games before you buy them. Definitely one of the best games on steam. 10/10
"A really fun and entertain simulator to play with friends or random strangers. Lots you can do especially with the added physics interactions like joins, flicking and general collisions.  A must buy for anyone who wants to play something a bit different from an FPS or ARPG."
there is basiclly no game you cannot play on this that could be played on a table
Great game!

"i love it, my only problem with it is that the game's dont have the same mechanics. Like in chess, it doesn't already take away the piece when you put yours there. But other than that it's a great game that you can do almost anything with. And if you want something that you can't find has been created yet, you can make it yourself."

So glad I did, it's freeking awesome :D Now I can play random games that I usually would have no one to play with locally online with random people or friends in faraway lands. In an age with simulators for everything, it's really nice that someone finally built a sim I would actually want to play.  I wish I had known about this gem sooner! Great buy nonetheless."
Really an excellent way to be able to get that feel of playing a game with friends - even when you can't be in the same room together.
Also posting this review from the game. 10/10
"totally recommend!!! Playing with friends is so much fun and we can play games together without having to drive three hours a day. Grab friends, (preferably the dirty minded ones) and get the Cards against Humanity mod) you will not regret it!"
hey i love your game but i really dislike the fact that you removed the grid i needed that for so many things i did on tts the snap is ok but i like the grid more if you could make the two work together or just give back the grid that would be great
"10/10  Tabletop simulator is an incredible value for the price you pay. For $20 you get the standard game with its dozens of preset boards and pieces as well free access to the countless custom player created content through the Steam Workshop; Or the ability to create your own content.   * The game features a superb loading and saving feature that records the exact location of all game pieces with minor clipping glitches that can be easily fixed in seconds. * The game allows for up to eight players at once * The game is excellent for: cooperative, player vs player, and solo gameplay. * The game features in game voice chat * Table top simulator has dozens of helpful in game tools for complex games (such as notecards and a tablet that can actually access webpages in game).   The only reason you shouldn't buy this game is because you need the $20 for food or bills, or if there is not a conceivable boargame in existence that you or your friends can enjoy alone/together."
"While somewhat cumbersome in its controls and mechanically limited in card ownership, the fact that you can play whatever games people happen to create for it makes it a great deal. Classics like Chess, Go, and your standard card games (like Poker) are all present and available, but the workshop lets you play many more games, including some that people have made uniquely for testing with others. This makes it a great vector for testing your own game with others, if you're a board game designer."
an amazing game i would reccomend this to everyone!

"This game has a learning curve...may be a lot easier for other people than me - but the tutorial was a bit short considering all the actions you can do in the game. That being said, it's a great game. There are endless possibilites once you get the hang of it. I still haven't gotten into a table top RPG game because I'm afraid everyone there will bash me for not understanding the mechanics of TableTop Simulator completely. I would still recommend this to anyone :]   Afterthought: There ARE jerks in the game that just want to mess up all the hard work you put into setting up your game. You can easily prevent them from SOME of the things they can do, but not all. So be warned.  Afterthought 2: After playing several games, I've found that many members of the community are extremely helpful and are very willing to answer any questions you may have (at least the ones I encountered)."

I mean I really like this one, I made few mods (private) w\ my friend, but game keeps constantly crashing because of memory leaks, it's like 3.5Gb with even not a half cards loaded. I know about unchecking 'full size texture' box, but in this case game becomes blurry as hell.  Well, at very least it's still something, but Im looking forward to the new updates of performance, not God damn DLC.  But don't think it's that bad, I'm still haaving fun with this game, just little bit upset in total.  Soz for poor English, folks. Have some fun or something."

"I don't know what to say about this game, so here is a recipe for pancakes,   Ingredients:  4tbsp plain flour (about 100g) 1 large free range egg ½ pint semi-skimmed milk + water (about 300ml - ¾ milk ¼ water) Pinch of salt Butter for frying How to make pancakes: Sieve the flour and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the mixture.  Break in the egg and stir to make a breadcrumby mix.  In a jug add 1/3 of a pint of milk and top up with water to make 1/2 a pint (200ml milk, 100ml water) - this makes a lovely light batter.  Add the milk and the water mix bit by bit, beating constantly to avoid lumps.  Tip:*If you have a food processor just throw all the ingredients in and zap until smooth!  Pop a large frying pan over a medium heat.  Add a large knob of butter (roughly 50g) and melt.  Pour the excess butter into a small bowl and reserve it for later.  Using a ladle pour a spoonful of the pancake batter into the hot pan and swirl to get a full covering - cook for about 1 min each side (it's ready when it's easy to flip over).  Serve immediately with sugar and lemon or other exciting toppings. We love cheese and Marmite for an extra British twist! Delicious!!"

"The idea of a physics sandbox to simulate board games seemed rather silly to me at first given that free projects like VASSAL exist that I'm perfectly happy to use, but it turns out to be surprisingly entertaining while still allowing you to play most board games quite efficiently (often more efficiently than you can with physical pieces). The steam workshop support is also fantastic. This game has led to a group of my online friends holding weekly board game nights for around a year and a half now, something which I couldn't've imagined being feasible 5 years ago. Physical games are still nice when everyone's in the same city, but this serves as an excellent standin otherwise."

The tablet feature taught me how many    eggs    I can fit in my    pan.       10/10 would    fry    again  Han Solo dies. 
Do I recommend this game? Probably not at this price. Material is all copyrighted and all what you are paying for is   gmod on a table   . But its great with friends
Are you bored with your new shiny high end games and need a break? Something casual? But still good looking?   I am very very picky and wasn't always happy with my purchases here... But this is a game that offers something for everyone. The Steam Workshop is flooded with awesome  modifications for this game. Play Monopoly Minecraft Edition in multiplayer. Doom the board game etc. etc.  The most fun thing is to flip the entire table if I lose :D
Would not recommend this. Basicaly if you do not like playing board games for hours on end you will not get more than 10 hours out of this game.

"Tabletop Simulator is a game where you play card games and board games... that's basiclly it. It's a good game. So let's go over the pros and cons.   Pros: -Lots of customization. -Very easy to play with friends. -Good physics.  Cons: -The community filled with trolls. -A little expensive. -Very easy to get bored. -Hard to find good servers. -Hard to get friends (minor complaint, to be honest).  I give this game a 8/10. While the game is good and all, it's a bore to play without friends. And don't even think about going to a public server or making a public server."

"Literally worthless, no support is offered for all the best games. Monopoly? Hungry Hungry Hippos? Clue? Risk?!? Tic-Tac-Toe? All of these classic, hard core games that the developers chose to toss aside in favour of pandering to the far wider and all together more casual 'nerd' market who play DnD and probably snort coke at cool parties in the Silicon Valley.   Meanwhile, real, hard working American's such as myself are left only to dream of the day when we stop being oppressed for our tastes in entertainment. See, this is why I ♥♥♥♥ing hate video games, because it appeals to this 'nerd' fantasy of an average middle class life, with regular board game nights after their lucrative day at the local software firm. I remember back on the football team when a bunch of 'nerds' came up to my whole team and LITERALLY HAZED US and asked if we wanted to join their TCG club OBVIOUSLY it was an attempted assault but the principle wouldn't listen to us, what the hell.  I am literally shaking just typing this."

If you have some spare cash, get this game.  If you have friends get this game.  If you have no friends, still get this game.  Overall Rating: 9/11"
"Enjoying a nice game of poker. Got a Royal flush, friends rage, flip table. He bought a Booster and DDoSed me for 2 months.  Pros. Great mechanics and alot of fun games, and a great intigration with the Workshop Cons. You'll loose alot of friends, and possibly even your computer."
Best game ever 9/11 would buy again.
"Yeah, It's alright."
"Fun idea, good concept.  Wish i had friends to do things with it.  Buy...yeah, go ahead."

This game is super gay. Buy it right now. You can play boardgames without even owning them! I'm 90% sure part of this is definitely illegal.
For this game Steam Workshop is magnificent but if there is some internet restrictions in your country you are suffering from downloading workshop files.Even you manage to download same files with your friends if you don't have a decent internet speed playing with friends becomes torture. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Atölye içeriği muhteşem lakin ülkenizdeki bazı sitelere giriş kısıtlamaları yüzünden dosyaları indirmekte sıkıntı çekiyorsunuz.Arkadaşlarınızla aynı dosyaları indirmeyi başarabilmişseniz bile hızlı bir internetiniz yoksa beraber oynamanız bir zulüme dönüşebiliyor.   
Multiplayer wont work and i have hunted down and tried all solutions. it was purchaced on humble bundle i tried to request a solution from all 3 companies and a refund from all 3 companies they tell me they cant because i didnt buy it from them directly i cant request a refund on steam because it isnt there game and i cant request a refund from humble bundle for that same reason so that being said  someone better pay up and fast because technicly i didn't get what i paid for and trying to fix it is causing me quite a bit of anxiety and mental distress. maybe my uncle can help me and other people like me with the same problem get there cash back as well im sure im not the only person with this horible problem of being tossed around by 3 seperate companies that refuse to give me any support. its not the cash im worried about its the principle and i refuse to be treated this way just as much so as i have been refused to be assisted in this issue.
"Everyone is a jerk. There are no games you can join where you're not kicked out before you can finish saying hello. You can only play this game with friends, which means I'm out of luck."
"Best for players with lots of time on their hands, but not for everyone."
Its a game
"Sometimes the simplest ideas are the best and TTS has the simplest idea for a game I've ever seen. 'Here's a table. Put what you want on it. Have fun'  It could stand a little spit and polish, but with an engaged modding community like steam workshop behind it I don't see how it can fail.   "

"This review was edited by me a few times as the game progressed from 'Early Access' to full release. I kept it a negative review each edit based mostly, but definitely not solely, on one thing; It has zero local co-op appeal over a physical version of any boardgame because the controls are clunky enough that it becomes a slower and more tedious event than sitting around a physical table and playing the physical boardgame. The 'simulator' part of this title haunts and hurts it in this respect. This listed feature was the main reason I was interested in and purchased the game. I play lots of local co-op and am always on the lookout for games that fit the bill. In my opinion, this one does not. I wrote my review to let others looking for the same feature to be aware.  I also had other issues I will no longer list due to not having played the game in some time. Which is why I editted one last time. 'Final' review or something. (In a earlier version of this review I mentioned dwindling numbers in the community which was very wrong at the time and that will explain the 'developer response')  I've left this review up because I am of the opinion that people needing reviews to make their decision on this game do not know enough people already playing it (online) to enjoy it. Just my opinion and my warning. And then of course for the other warning about local co-op. With the growing popularity of a 'living room' or 'couch' PC, and the fairly low system requirements of the title, I think its an important enough warning to say. I'd recommend skipping this title.  But! There are multitudes of people that have and will enjoy this game for its various other features and if you are truly interested I recommend reading the many many many positive reviews of the many many many people who have enjoyed this title.  Happy shopping!"
"Neat but it has too many glitches and is particularly buggy on Mac, often crashing mid-game."
"Game is actually good, but the problem of this game lies in community. All you can find in servers browser is passworded servers and nothing else. And if you wanna play in open server there would be definitely a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who will flip a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed table.  If you got a bunch of friends who've got this game -- buy it. Otherwise don't."
Cannot play more than 4 players with my friends Lagging af . . . .
"Had issues and couldn't play the multiplayer. I tried everything possible in my computer but I could not fix it, and could not find any potential information to solve the problem on internet or in the community of the game (only found people with the same problem that could not help themselves either). The dev. tried to help without luck either.   For the small time I played it, it looked okay, with a poor interface but seens interesting to play with friends.  Refounded the game.  Buy for your own risk."
"Great idea for a game, and probably much better if you have 3-4 friends to play it with. If you're on your own however, you're going to struggle to get any enjoyment out of this. With a player base that can be very unfriendly and sometimes pretty abusive towards newbies, I can't recommend it."
"Bad community, uninterested developers, and extremely convoluted game engine."
"While the game works as intended, the community is wayy too reclusive. It's impossible to find people for D&amp;D games, or other RPG's. It might be fun to mess around in checkers or chess, but, lets face it.. TTS is capable of much much more.   If you're looking for something to play D&amp;D or other tabletop games, you probably should look elsewhere.  If TTS wants to boost its numbers, and actually connect gamers, I would think it would have to sharply drop is price. Then it would be a contender against Roll20, and other VTT's."
"I'm sure this is an unpopular opinion, but I did not enjoy my time in TTS (VR). It made the games HARDER, due to it inexplicably not having pieces follow your movements as if you were holding them. Yes, they follow your hand, somewhat, but not precisely. It's very....floaty. On top of that, there are no snap-to points on game boards, making it ponderous to place a piece.  "
I got muted by a mod for asking where all the girls were at in global chat. Stop oppressing me.
"Simple TL:DR Version  Think of Tabletop Simulator as a blank 8x11 piece of paper. You can do a infinite amount of things with it. Make a paper airplane (times all the possibilities of different paper airplanes). You can write or draw an infinite variation of things, etc... But at the end of the day would you pay $5 or $10 for a piece of paper (that ordinarily cost $0.02), when you wanted to buy a book with pre-written content, or a painting, etc... (for that same price)?  Table top simulator essentially out of the box is nothing more than a item importer with drag and drop functionality. Just like a piece of paper, its is amazingly simple, but yet has the potential to do so many things. It is a framework for other games, but by itself it really doesn't do anything. So if your intent is to buy tabletop simulator and play functional scripted table top games, you're going to be severely disappointed. It has the potential of doing it, but it doesn't mean it does it by itself, nor does it mean its even an elegant means of doing it.  Essentially the main thing you're paying for when you buy Tabletop Simulator is dedicated server, and software that has clumsy drag and dropping physics, and the ability to import custom models. That is really all you get from Tabletop Simulator out of the box.   There are mods for Tabletop Simulator that allow you to import 'games' into Tabletop Simulator. But what that really means 99% of the time is just custom models, such as the pieces, board, or cards. It doesn't actually add any functionality or mechanics to them.  ____________________  I don't really know what to say about this game... because it fails horribly from a functionality stand point... but at the same time it lives up to its name...  You see the game is called Tabletop Simulator... it allows you to simulate your favorite tabletop games... such as having the board, cards, pieces, etc... Which you can freely drag around, flip over, and rescale. But that is really all this game basically does... allows you to drag and drop custom models around. So it means that yeah you can play a lot of board / tabletop games (like chess or checkers) that you like in real life in which all you really do is drag and drop stuff.  Here is where is where I find this game severely lacking... things like lets say trying to play poker. The game has a premade setup for poker... but the premade setup for poker doesn't do anything other than give you a deck of cards, and a couple of poker chips. None of the poker game mechanics are scripted into the game itself. Meaning the game doesn't detect how much you bet, or how many players you have, it doesn't have automated dealing, it doesn't do any of the actual poker mechanic stuff like detect what pairs you have or how strong your hand is.  Same with chess. For instance if you load up the pre-made chess setup in the game... none of the rules of chess are programed into the game. It just loads up a chess board for you, and places all the pieces in the correct starting position. Meaning if you pick up your knight, you can drag and drop it anywhere you want without it following the rules of chess which dictates it should move in an L shape.  So yes overall this game allows you to simulate tabletop games by letting you have certain cards, boards, pieces, but due to its limited functionality out of the box, it is very poor at actually simulating the game you are trying to play due to the lack of out of the box pre-scripted scenarios and interact able interfaces and just general overall functionality.  Essentially this game is better described better as a drag and drop simulator where you can load custom models into and do some minor scripting rather than a functional automated digital tabletop game simulator.  At the same time the game does have scripting support for modders... which means someone could potentially script the rules for all the endless potential games that Tabletop Simulator could support. But realistically very few people have the know how to actually make use of the scripting function, even fewer people have the will to do so, and even fewer have actually done so.  So I can't recommend Tabletop Simulator because the game in reality it is just a clumsy drag and drop simulator. It doesn't have any out of the box game support that effectively allows the user to simulate or play actual tabletop games with other players... things like possibly gui textbox interfaces to make things like character sheets easily. Or anything to help the average user set to set up game rules, or preset of rules for things like chess, poker, black jack, monopoly, etc... without having advanced knowledge on how to script things.  If the game was $5 then I would recommend it if you okay with a software where you mainly just clumsily just dragging and drop things. Though in my opinion it is definitely not worth the full $20 price tag, nor is it really worth the $10 (50% off pricetag) I paid when I bought on sale. Especially since I can probably find a flash games online for free that has better functionality for a lot of the basic tabletop games. Or just play online with other people for free through Microsoft Windows preinstalled Checkers, Chess, or play Facebook Poker, or Solitare.  If the developers could add in for instance pre-scripted templates for things like character sheets for DnD (of at least easy to use text boxes like you can find in MS Word or Powerpoint), or pre-scripted behavior for things like chess pieces that you can assign to custom models, and flesh out their preset 'game' (blackjack, poker, chess, etc) modes with actual scripted functionality, then I would recommend this game. Until then I really can't really recommend this game since it does a really poor job of simulating particular tabletop games. Tabletop Simulator can do a little bit of everything, but at the same time its sub par to every other specialized tabletop game program in terms of actual functionality and game play experience. Which just makes me wonder why I would recommend Tabletop Simulator over some other game or app that specializes in the tabletop game the other person is looking for."
"Not worth the money, non-intuitive controls, not enough base content, volatile community.  Peer pressured into buying, not worth it. 2/10"
If you don't have any friends there's no point of buying this.
"As of Oct 26, 2016 I cannot recommend this game when you can get OCTGN for FREE.  This may still be a great purchase for you (especially on sale 10$) but in it's current state I cannot recommend it. This is entirely over personal reasons so let me explain. I bought this to play a couple board games and a handful of card games (to avoid the rediculous cost of them) but the entire lack of scripting in 99% of the games as well as multiple versions of the same games through Workshop, many being sub-par, along with them being this overly time consuming and a pain to set up even if you know ALL the rules of the game you want to play. This also makes it very difficult to get anyone who doesn't know how to play a game to join because there is very little if any automation in most of the games. If you wanna play LOTR, Star Wars, Warhammer, along with MANY other card and board games go and download OCTGN for FREE and play through their service, maybe even support them for 3$.  If you want to play Monopoly and Chess and pay for a handful of DLC games then this will be a worthy addition for you. Otherwise OCTGN or sit back and see how this develops."
"I feel like this was falsely advertised as much more user friendly than it is. There is no AI and very few servers to play on for most games. The most useful thing it has is the ability to play a game with friends on the same computer but then, why even play virtually in the first place? I love the concept, but it is not realized in the current form. The workshop offers the one respite for this game, the community will create a plethora of new ideas through it I'm sure. 4/10 is what it currently gets from me, felt like it had 8-9ish potential."
"Currently I cant reccomend this game, the situation of people joining a server and throwing cards around ruins it"
 Early Access Review
"Good game if you have friends and want to play using LAN connection.  Bad if you don't, and need to use online connection.  Online connection seems to lag a lot which prevents you from even hearing other players and it bothers you when you can't take a single piece off the table and can't put it somewhere you like because of the lag.  Overall, I don't think that this game deserves a negative but because of what I've experienced above I couldn't play the game much so I think money for play value is very very low."
well :( the multiplayer is either password protected or you get some annoying people. so if you want to invent some games or want to play with your friends there are many possibilities. but the community is very unpleasant. 15.07.2016
"Great game crippled by poor multiplayer implimentation and overly sensitive moderators. You better bring your friends with you if you plan on buying this game because its stupidly difficult to make and play games without spamming general chat with LFG. Which leads me to my next point. The only way to find players for games is spamming LFG in general chat. But if you are spamming, then you get kicked by the moderators. So there is a good chance you will get kicked just for trying to find a game. The game designers dropped the ball on this one. In fact, unless you are discussing a game while never repeating yourself, you will get kicked from chat. Make a joke, any joke, get modded. LFG more than once, get modded. Discuss anything other than a game, get modded. The chat police is a bit heavy handed."

Friend got ahead of me by one point. RIP table.
"Pros:  -Physics simulators are always amusing. -Tableflip button is a must for realistic tabletop simulating -Lots of games available in the workshop. Cons: -Buggy as hell. Don't expect to be able to just pick up and play with your friends. -Don't expect those workshop games to actually work. -Pure physics sim. Most board games have very little rule enforcement, which can be bad if you don't know the rules."
It's raw and it crashes. I'll keep checkin back for updates though.  Edit months later games to be stable now. But still lacking in some features I need. Restricted camera view based on player. I.e player 2 can't see player 1's cards / piece fronts (stratego pieces).
"This is the most UNSTABLE game ever, at least on the mac version. Sometimes the game wont start, and most of the time the game crashes whenever you you try to load up anytihing."
"cool idea but this program could use a lot of cleaning up and improvements. Lag between players can get pretty bad, hidden areas and drawing tools are pretty junk, they could be much better. Lots of cool games on workshop but feels so incomplete, ways to share rules with other players?"
 Early Access Review
"I can't recommend this game. I love the idea, but dislike the way it is performed.  I bought TS to play with miniature models, and it's nothing but a drag to use for that. The physics are horrible, frustrating and time consuming. Several tools are also missing to make miniature gaming efficient and enjoyable. Most irritating of all, models you move lag behind slowly and intentionally, which is nothing but frustrating.  Why did you even put physics in this game? Since when did a tabletop game need physics (other than gravity that is)?  May be usable if you wanna play the classics, like chess, and you don't have anyone in real life to play with; else not."
Game is good. If you want technical support then forget it. Latest update makes the game hang when opened. No response from technical support for nearly a week now.  Edit: Now 2.5 weeks and no reply.
I can't get anywhere with any of the games. It is very slow
"The physics are good, it is otherwise a waste of money"
"It's cool, but not as cool as I was expecting. Maybe my expectations were too high.  I have lots of friends who enjoy board games and tabletop RPG, so this game doesn't add much. If that's not your case, I bet you'll enjoy it a lot."
"I like the premise and I'm sure its fun if you can play it, but they do not publish this games network connectivity requirements so I was never able to access the server browser to play anything with anyone. I was able to direct connect a friend but we could not see or talk to eachother despite us both being in the game together. Their response on the forums is 'turn it off and on again, press reset, unplug and replug everything, remove your router' and while that's a cute IT crowd response to a customer problem, it doesn't help me open ports and poke holes in the firewall."
"If you came here looking for a Tabletop simulator review you're in the wrong place. However, if you came here for a apple pie recipie, you came to the right place.   Pastry  2 cups Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons shortening 4 to 6 tablespoons cold water  Filling  1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/8 teaspoon salt 8 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples (8 medium) 2 tablespoons butter or margarine   Directions  1 In medium bowl, mix 2 cups flour and 1 teaspoon salt. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary). 2 Gather pastry into a ball. Divide in half; shape into 2 flattened rounds on lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling. 3 Heat oven to 425°F. With floured rolling pin, roll one pastry round into round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch glass pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate. Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side. 4 In large bowl, mix sugar, 1/4 cup flour, the cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Stir in apples until well mixed. Spoon into pastry-lined pie plate. Cut butter into small pieces; sprinkle over filling. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1/2 inch from rim of plate. 5 Roll other round of pastry into 10-inch round. Fold into fourths and cut slits so steam can escape. Unfold top pastry over filling; trim overhanging edge 1 inch from rim of plate. Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute as desired. Cover edge with 2- to 3-inch strip of foil to prevent excessive browning. 6 Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until crust is brown and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust, removing foil for last 15 minutes of baking. Serve warm if desired. "
"This game is the best way to make your friends salty. Please do not buy this game for anyone or you will be consumed by the flame war. Tables were flipped, friends were lost and now I'm sad. This game is according to my scources ' Este juego es muy mala '"
"Dead game, even if you find someone there's no way to have the game force players to play by the rules. There's not even that many options to make games."
  This game is stupid because you can't shoot anyone. I like playing TF2 with my friends and I like being healed by medic while I am heavy but there is no heavy in this game also I like my dog named lucy she is 13 years old and she lives in my apartment and sometimes its hard because she isn't used to living in an apartment so she barks a lot but usually she is good indoors. Please pm me i don't have a lot of friends
"Overall not impressed, choppy and unstble game would fall behind other players by at least 10 minutes at times and if it does keep up someone always crashes out. Rather play board games irl or atleast on a better game."

 Early Access Review
"I was hoping this game is for 'single player' but it is not and it does not work. It says it is but it is not. I bought this mainly for 'CHINESE CHECKERS'...nope, not happening.  I can not play any games with this app., and I'm not a happy camper. I give up trying to get help. I really wish they'd fix it. Its not my PC because all the games play except 4 or 5. I do not know what the heck is going on and don't want to give bad review because I really want to play this game and wish someone would help me. I give up on the forums and support help. :( &lt;--- disappointed."
"When everything works, it's brilliant. All the fun of sitting around a table with your friends, now supporting friends who you are thousands of miles away from. Awesome.  But:   - The UI is clunky. Most importantly to me, this is the 'panning and zooming' aspect of camera controls. If you have an angle from which you can see absolutely everything, it's fine. But usually you need to constantly zoom into different parts of the board to see what's going on properly. You can 'save' camera angles, which makes this less of an issue for certain games, but most games you just cannot pick a couple of angles which will be relevant all the time.   - It crashes constantly. As in, just closes, straight back to desktop, without an error message (and without any error log that I can find). I have been told that in other people's experience, crashes are most commonly related to 'out of memory' errors. I expect that can't be the issue here unless TTS is keeping things in memory that it really shouldn't.   - There is no way to 'pre-load' assets. Card faces are loaded as needed, which brings the entire game to a grinding 'did my PC just lock up completely?' halt while it does such intensive tasks as 'downloading a file' (Is it single-threaded, perhaps?)   - I would not base my review on this alone, because I'm honestly not sure, but: 90% of the Steam Workshop content appears to be no-way-in-hell-was-this-authorised board game rips"
"Totally regret purchasing this game. The app itself is very poorly designed and most definitely not worth the $20 pricetag. The graphics are poor, the mechanics are awkward and cumbersome, and it's very difficult to use. If you're looking to play some good board games, check out board game arena."
Fun for a few minutes. I reccomend playing with friends (unless you're lonely and until they keep flipping the table). Theres not much to do in this game. I tried to like it but I don't have enough friends.

Pros: Could make your own games Workshop support animated rpg minifigures Some cool custom things you could do (ex. custom tables, game boards, jigsaw puzzles, and cards) Cons: Controls are confuseing No cpu opponents to go against Gui is confusing many glitches Ideas: Make tutorials for pre-installed games Please make Cpu opponents for single player games  Thank you for reading this.

"This game was okay. For the first 3 hours. Not much to do in this game, so if you are looking for something to get your moneys worth go look somewhere else. This game is not worth 20 dollars let alone 13 from the sale."

"Was very much enjoying the game, however i was not allow to speak my mind in the ways that the golbal chat is too open for inturpretation and could be use for anything, it turns out i was wrong! global now means news about the game, who knew? i am dissapointed with the legal system withing this game and wish to have a formal apology withing 5 hours and 23 minutes."

"I am sorry but I can't recommend this game. It just doesn't work for me. It's a fantastic idea and I guess plenty of people play it with no problems, but my friend bought this for me and our gaming group and after a couple of hours we have yet to be able to play one game successfully on it. We spent that time trying to set up the games and everything was so glitchy. Stuff would not work. Couldn't pick up pieces, couldn't hear each other in voice chat. Sometimes couldn't connect. We tried Scotland Yard and Descent 2nd. Edition, but we could never get stuff to work long enough to set up the boards much less play them."

"It's a fun game, but I can't recommend it at its current price. You'll have to have some friends with this game because almost all of the servers are either locked or unplayable due to latency issues."
"Welp, i was hoping for better controls in a simulator game.everything is controlled by your mouse, and its awful."
"The base game is wonderful. The DLC, however, is not. It's not really mentioned anywhere at all, but everyone who wants to play has to own a copy of the DLC.  Which 100% kills any chance of using the DLC for a massive number of players.  I'll change my review when this is made more clear."
"Its one good game to play a casual game with your friends, but the rules are not very clear in some games and the settings could be much better. While you playing a game you can actually play it as you want and not follow the rules no one will check. If you think you want to play solo or tyry to join a game I dont recommend veyr low on servers with people playing or open for you to join. I think the game still needs a lot of improvement."
Not a very fun game. Most of the games are broken and unplayable.
"LOL ! This game is a big fake . We CAN NOT play against AI cz there ISNT Ai . Full of options useless , seems like it is made with paint ( of windows ). Big ♥♥♥♥ to avoid ."
It was sadly boring 
 Early Access Review
"Load a mod or two, start fiddling around a bit to get a feel for the product and especially see if it can reliably save games... my best use case for this would be to host long Axis and Allies or more complex wargames over long sessions.  Well, a few minutes in I decide to load an autosave to see if it works properly, and lo and behold, an infinite loading bug. I don't even want to know how many bugs I'd find if I dug for them seriously or used this for a long-term game with my group. This should still be in early access.  Also, I really don't like the way they do Steam Workshop contents. Instead of hosting stuff on Steam servers creators have to upload textures for in-game elements somewhere online, which guarantees that in a few months with the constant decay of free hosting sites a lot of mods will still appear on the Workshop but will be unusable."
 Early Access Review
"I did support this game originally, yet now they are going the paid mod route as Superfight already existed as several mods before. The entire purpose of this game was a community creating board games and card games and getting together and playing them. Many people lack others in real life to actually -play- these games so it's quite nice to be able to have friends to get together and play this with. Once again the industry raises my expectations and absolutely crushes them into dust."
A classic example of how a bad community can ruin a good game. The large amount of public servers died out very quickly due to trolls and griefers.
"Being listed as a Singleplayer and Coop game among other things, I thought it would have computer players/Ai, but it doesn't. This doesn't seem to be mentioned on the store page.  'Singleplayer' is you alone staring at a table."

Community is ♥♥♥♥. Go into a room and ask 'what game is this?' and you'll probably get banned.

"Honestly a cool idea, but it's essentially a physics simulator, with various game pieces. I really want to give it a good review, because so far I have really enjoyed it, but there are some things that I feel could be worked on before they start devoting their time to pumping out DLC. It's ridiculous that there is no floor, and pieces and the table just fall to oblivion, I mean, is it that hard to have two tables in the same environment, and scale one of them up to room size?   It's hard to like any game whos developers haven't really finished the game, but are already making DLC. The game feels sloppy and has a pretty steep learning curve, which makes games like Betrayel almost impossible to play on it."
Not for me. More game designer than structured gaming. Didnt want to get so involved and wanted somthing more 'standard'. I dont have an issue with the game itself as it is very good at what it does.

 Early Access Review
"The game itself is good, but this is really a game to play if you have friends to play with. Almost all of the servers are password locked. The servers that are unlocked for anyone to join, are mainly checkers, chess, and poker. Also, if you try to join a public room, a lot of the time you'll get kicked out within a minute for no reason. Unfortunately I'll be getting a refund for this game. Only if you have friends who like board games, then get this game."
"This is not really a game per se but a sandbox/playground physics simulator. Games were created in the simulator such as solitaire, chess, checkers, etc. You can play the created games but with many limitations. Here is a list of pros and cons as to why I do not recommend it.  1. Simulating Board Games  a. One is able to create board games and play them. An example is the game of LIFE is available in the subscription section.  b. The rules of the games are not there. An example is the game of LIFE, Monopoly, Chess etc. can be played anyway you want. This is a double edge sword because people can play out of turn, flip the table, screw with pieces, and mess things up really easily. Some people would disagree because the host can lock specific pieces of the board down which brings me to the next part of the issue, controls. 2. Controls  a. The controls of this game are way too complex for a person who is not adept at computers or does not have strong hand eye coordination. In simple terms if you expect to just use your mouse to control the entire game, forget it. You have to use a multitude of keyboard inputs, mouse, moving the camera etc.   b. The host of the game may be able to lock pieces down, but the tasks of hosting them game become way too complex to really get into the game and enjoy it for what it is. 3. Multiplayer/Social  a. This is one of the few simulators that allow multiplayer interactions through LAN or Internet. If you have friends/family you want to play with it might work. The catch is if your friends or family has patience and is very adept at complex controls.  b. Online community is a mixed bag of serious people, trolls, and griefers.  4. Graphics  a. The graphics is very nice.   Overall, the idea is great but the execution is clunky and poor. The main downside is the controls because if you want to play with a friend who is not so adept at computers, it will not happen. Playing Candyland with a kid who is not adept with hand eye coordination or knows complex contorls, he/she will just get frustrated. The simulator has great potential only if the controls were well defined and simplified for all crowds."
 Early Access Review
"Have to give this Game a negative review. tried now over 2h to finde a game and have some fun with it. but there was no fun, only frustration. The only good think in this game is when you have active friends who play this game and workshop.  I don`t know why this game is taged as 'singleplayer' when you cant play it alone. Its like I would sell a Car without any motor in it. So you can still drive it when you or yourfriend is pushing the car.  Also I can`t understand reviews like “It’s just a really nice way to play and experiment with new board games.”, how can you play a new Board Game without knowing how to play it? Thats maybe a good point to learn if there would be a good SinglePlayer but there is nothing who explain you how the rules works, and you cant enter a Multiplayer and play with peoples you don`t know because they don`t like to tell how the game works. No one like to play with NOOBS! If you like to watch peoples playing I can go watch Youtube or Twitch Channels, don`t need to buy that game then.  Negative: 1. This Game has no Singleplayer. There are no Bots, you can only play it alone or with 'friends' on one PC with one Mouse and one Keyboard. 2. Multiplayer is awfull, there are a lot of idiots and trolls 2.1 There are more rooms but uses Password so you can`t enter them. (this is a minus and plus) 3. You can do what ever you like to do, because there are no rules. Cheating is pretty easy and you can flip the Table so the game is over for all players. You can flip everything, you also can play for the other player, nothing is blocked. 4. Controlls are bad, realy bad. You get used to it after a while but still feels bad. 5. Graphic is like old PS2 games. Not that graphic is important on this kind of games but for 20€ it could be much more then 'cluncky point and click games' 6. Game is confused because of point 3. There is no balance and if you play games like Monopoly its hard to see who bought witch street also text is so small that you have to zoom to read the cards.  Postitive: 1. You can add a Password as host so no trolls can enter your Game. 2. If you have friends who play this game you can enjoy it and have a lot of fun with it. 3. Workshop, you can create your owen game or download games from other modders.  For me its a 4 of 10. Not worth 20€ and also not worth buying it with 50% off. Makes only sence if you have friends who play this game or if you love to mod your owen board or card game."
It's very ridiculous that a game where it's showed the option SINGLE PLAYER don't give to you the possibility to play in single player....fantastic the developers sell a game for single that have not an Ai with which you would play. So what they have created?.......hum ......hum.......it smell very badly. I hope for the near future that devs will put into this game(game??????)an Ai if not after 5 minutes that you play with yourself you will probably start to sleep. 
Playing playing *flips the table in rage* better to play with friends in real life
"nearly all servers are passworded, unless you have friends who also own this, then good luck.  might aswell buy a real board game."

Most of the severs are locked or in another country.

"When me steam says I've played for 4.2 hours, I know that it was more like 1 hour of actual gameplay. The rest of the hours of in game time is not being able to connect to anything. I hope someone gets their money back for this. Other than not being able to play it, the game looks great. 9/10 pending"
It's just a table top with pieces. Don't expect any automation it's just you moving every little piece. If you're expecting the games to be automated in any way do not get this game. Waste of money since it's seriously buying a virtual table for 20 bucks
"Not a really good game, as this is more of a open platform game, and you need friends to play it with you. If you had a lot of friends to play this game with, then it would be much more fun."

"Controls too weird for someone like me, controller option was causing a buttload of bugs, I refunded it pretty quickly"
Choppy connectivity. Laggy updating. Asking for a refund.
I would like it more if there was an easier way to play with random people.
If you don't buy it with a friend don't buy it. 99% of the servers have password.
Actual content is hosted on file sharing sites rather than steam. Frequent bugs/freezes/ctd's plague what was a great idea.

Nothing works right in this game
Watch the previews... theyre not what the game really is. yes but its hard to manuver obkects and is virtually impossable to do (some) of the things that ar on da trailer. id give it 10/10 4 physics but 5/10 for keeping me interested.
"Waste of time. Brought Darkest Night because it sounded cool, but had to purchase Tabletop Simulation too. Could pick cards/dice up but there's no way to properly start the game."
"The performance of this game is so weird on Mac.. I launch it, and the fans kick in immediately! It takes so much power, and not only that, but it keeps draining power as if it was playing, when it's been cmd+q'd out of! If you have that problem: Go to activity monitor, go on the CPU tab, click it once, and it should show you TTS in the absolute top. Terminate that programme, and don't ever quit out of it like that again. Instead go to the main menu, exit game and exit it that way..  It is gorgeous, however, so if you're on windowns or don't mind the flight-engine in your room, go right ahead :)"
I really like this but Ping can destroy your.. Me and main Friend was playing Chess i was haev ping over 1000.. So if u have MAXI INTERNET you can play this game.
don't buy this unless you're 100% sure you like board games.  only got this because I thought it'd be fun to play board games on PC  but it's even more boring IMO  don't hate on my opinion

"If you don't have a group of friends who really want to play all the time, it is not worth it.  There are only about 10 unlocked servers at any given time, and none play CAH or SuperFight or the like."

"Would be nice to play this game, but microphone voice doesn't work in game. My mic works in all oth3er games that requires it, works fine every where else, but cannot get my voice to work in this game. Response is 'problem with my computer'??????????? WTF? Wait, so my mic works in multiple other games, works in skype, works in google voice, works as input device in just about any ♥♥♥♥ing recording program, but the devs of this game demand the reason it doesn't work with 'their' game is because it's my ♥♥♥♥ing computer's problem? What a douchy response from a dev.   this game is useless without a microphone and I spent so much time researching, where i see all over google others who have this problem, that I passed 2 days purchase time and now I cna't refund.  Can't play game, no one will play with someone without a mic, can't get a refund. Screwed. don't buy."
"It's an interesting game, but the controls are kind of odd to use, and it'd be nice to have some rules on the games...  Not everyone knows evey single game..."
it want fun so I recomend that you dont buy this game
Too bad this doesn't work. When I try to browse servers nothing ever comes up. Bummer. Maybe they will fix TTSim someday.  May I please have a refund on my purchases?

Not very customizable and I don't think it's great. Want a refund and uninstalling.
"Without friends it's a bit ♥♥♥♥. 90% of the servers require passwords (locked) 100% of the servers are foreign for me (I'm Australian) Realised why board game are called bored- i mean board games (no hate on chess though, i grew up with that ♥♥♥♥) I like the fact you can flip a coin by pressing R on it, that's pretty cool.  BUUUUUUUUT it sucks ♥♥♥.  Oh well. I wanted to play you."
I love tabletop games...  They should be played with friends on the tabletop though. Not strangers pretending to play tabletop games.
"This game is possibly the worst game I've played in years. Not only does it have the worst community topping games like COD, LOL, Dota 2, CSGO, and anything ever exisiting, but the people moderating the game's IRC channel are a bunch of neanderthals. Not only did I get kicked from the public IRC for voicing my opinion in an albeit passionate manner, but previously I got banned from a public jigsaw puzzle server for outpuzzling the host with my puzzle skills. I requested a refund for this atrocity. If you're a fun, smart guy like me, don't buy this game."
people always flip the table and ruin ALLL the fun. I cant play boardgames with real people because I have no friends and now I cant even play them online :(
"Its not bad, but it is not worth the cash."
Opened up the game and the first thing that happens is the table floating away. Can't get it back. ♥♥♥♥ my life. ♥♥♥♥ this game. It's buggy. Don't buy it. Please.

Very disappointing program - more gimmick than serious boardgame utility - its very hard to play games using this program - controls and camera are terrible. The root cause of the problem is the attempt to do things in 3D that is an utter fail. Vassal and OCTGN are infinitely better.
Like surgeon simulator but trying to play a board game. Not playable
Is it really worth to buy. Personally i got bored quickly of this game and found myself uninstalling it because i didn't play it.
"Pros -has tons of modding -cheaper than buying boardgames or paying for cards -great gameplay, with all the phisics Cons -Not a big community(most of them play private) -You will need a couple of frineds to play games on this, unless you got that you are going to have a bad time.  "
"this is as logical as playing goat simulator, would not recommend to anyone that has sense and common knowledge of how the system is played in our society. Through a deep critical throught process upon playing this game, i have realized that this game is not good. There are too many bugs and to many hackers, plus the story mode only lasts for 4 hours! LET ME REPEAT THAT! FOUR ♥♥♥♥ING HOURS! 444444 F O U R H O U R S, i might as well watch straight out of compton or lord of the ♥♥♥♥ing rings, because finishing one of those movies will are equivalent to the length of the story.

"Tabletop is a game where you usually have to download the games to play them which will take extra storage for the host of the game. It's literally just sitting here playing bored games. I do not recommend this game for people who want to have fun or want to have excitement because this game is actually pretty boring. It'd be a great game for relaxing and playing with some friends, but not an all the time game."
the game deveolpot makes the chess too hard i can't beat my friends no matter what i try
"i don't recommend this game unless you have friends who play this and even then, it's still iffy the only guaranteed way to get at least one game out of this is to buy it along with your friends, not solo t. refunded it once after friends goaded me into buying it, never played with them, another set of friends goaded me into buying it, bought it again, never played with them"

"I found this repulsive when i watched the gameplay video but it still gave it a shot since it was on sale. The gameplay was stale at best with most of the games in server being click and drag type and also most of the games on the community servers were made by other people with their friends, so if you're wondering where i'm going with this, Here's the answer,  1) You will get kicked out of the server a lot 2) If you ask people for help on how to play whatever crappy game they created, they will ignore you (if they are being generous) and/or kick you 3)The graphics are horrendous. It makes no sense for so many people to be invested in this atrocious game when there are much better games out there. Just forgo this one, it really has no noticeable pros from my perspective. (PS: If you're a european and you speak whatever language they speak, you will not be kicked or such instead you will be cordially invited to keep playing with them). **sighs** "
"Look this game is fun, and all, but it is most definetely not worth $20.00... i'd say $9.00 max. You could make the arguement of HTC Vive, but still if I just bought an $800 toy I would not wanna spend another $20 on the toy for the toy..."

" FOREWARD  All I can say about this simulator is the experiences I've seen and personally encountered. It is also important to note that last time I did an accurate review of what a game developer did, that game developer flagged the review as being abusive. Furthermore the developer of this game decided to go through the Steam forum for this and remove any helpful information I posted to people regarding certain situations they had questions about. On top of that last time I gave an accurate review, I also had dumb a$$ gamers leaving idiotic comments that had nothing to do with the review or the problems, under the review. So any type of ignorant reply with an excuse, will get deleted. _______________________________________________________   OVERVIEW  This is absolutely horrible. In short, it sucks. The staff are absolutely ignorant and refuse to help anyone and anyone that has called them out on their behavior gets banned and silenced. So this is just another company who cannot handle any flaws being pointed out in their product and have no interest in customer service and blame everyone who points it out as being negative.  _______________________________________________________   WORKSHOP/NEXUS COMPATIBIITY  Unfortunately the way this program has custom content from the Steam workshop implemented, is absolutely the worst way to implement custom content. Usually in the workshop you click subscribe, then launching the game again shows the custom content has been installed which is usaually launched from the main menu. After I subscribed to the item from the Steam Workshop I have linked below, I restarted Steam, launched the Tabletop Simulator, and the custom content was nowhere to be found.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=352341114   So I then chose to click the only obvious option which was titled Workshop (With a picture of the Steam Workshop logo on it and it was specifically for UPLOADING something you made to the Workshop.  Using Steam Workshop Subscription Conclusion: Fail  As far as the NEXUS goes, like the Steam workshop, I went to the nexus and downloaded this  http://www.nexusmods.com/tabletopsimulator/mods/288/?  Despite the langaue itself on the NEXUS being in Russian, the file placement should have been obvious.  Comparing this to any Elder Scrolls mods, manual places of mod files should be no different. But yet I cannot get it to work or anything and that's because there is no explanation given. There is no readme or instructions of any kind about what directory custom files need to be put into and there is no way to guess. So neither the Nexus, the Steam forum, The Simulator itself, and the official Berserk Games forums has anything helpful to offer and nor can you get help with this on the forums.   NEXUS CONCLUSION:  Incompetent uploaders  _______________________________________________________   GETTING HELP:  Like everything else in the gaming world, getting help is absolutely atrocious and useless. The gaming community has somehow managed to turn games into actual schoolwork. Game developers unreasonably expect players to do a massive amount of research outside the game to learn what they are required to explain to you the player as far as game play basics go and that is totally is absurd. I buy a game to play it, I do not buy a game to have to learn how to play it which the developers are now doing. Anyone that has to leave a game to get information from another source outside the game, to learn what the game developer is asking you to do is ♥♥♥♥ poor programming.  _______________________________________________________   IN CLOSING:   This schoolwork mentality the average gamer is delusional with is what's all wring with games. People don't even know what the word tutorial even means anymore and don't even know the difference between instructions and hand holding now. Gamers fail to get the simple concept about product release that if a developer releases a product (Which is what games are) then the developer is responsible for making sure that the person purchasing it, knows how to use it. Telling people to use Google, watch videos, RTFM and all the other crap has no relevance to anything. Those are just ignorant statements made by brain dead gamers who somehow have gotten it into their heads that looking things up is actually part of what you pay for in a game, which is totally moronic. When you buy a game then everything is supposed to be self contained including every little piece of instruction that dumb gamers think is hand holding.  Games fail to grasp that when it comes to the basics and instructions, a game is not supposed to require anyone to go searching for any type of 3rd party information as well as developer information about what to do in a game. outside of the game. This means in the beginning of the game, if something is supposed to be clicked on, then the developer is suppsed to tell you to move the icon over it and click it. Regardless of how small an instruction is, it's still supposed to be explained and handed to the player...This whole 'Use common sense or no one else had problems' crap gamers love to shovel, has no relevance and is not even a valid statement.  _______________________________________________________  I cannot recommend this to anyone until explicit instructions for how to use everything in the entire interface has been implemented as a patch by the developers. Anyone that tries to argue against this with any type of excuse then tries to say it's not an excuse, is making blatant excuses for the developers ♥♥♥♥ poor programming and incompetence   This video is a prime example of how stupid developers really are:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_vcy7I0zIM   This video shows how gamers go to any lengths to defend the incompetent developers:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7I6DQiwki4 "

"a piece of ♥♥♥♥ game, dont buy"
This game is far too expensive for what its worth. There are only around 20 games that aren't great and then you have to pay extra for the dlcs after paying £15 which is very expensive for what the game should be worth (around £5 in my opinion) I tried playing it with friends and still not that fun.

ITS ♥♥♥♥
"Don't get this game! I wasted $10 on this horrible game. Good idea, but it crashes a lot for me, and the controls are horrible. If u want to play board games go to your nearest toy story or Walmart and get a physical board game, don't even try to play solitaire, it take 3 clicks to move a card. DO NOT GET THIS GAME I AM WARNING YOU!!!!!!"
"This game is so ♥♥♥♥ing awful, this is literally one of the worst games I have ever played in my entire life. That statement doesn't even need an explanation, but I'll give one anyway. I was about to play chess with top level professionals from across the globe, and we decided to use tabletop simulator as a platform for playing chess on. I was winning 32 and 0 against these professionals when suddenly they decided that they would rather act like a complete waste of human skin, and decided to troll the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. They flipped the table and cheated, their actions as a result influenced my decision to give the worst score to any game I have ever reviewed. I hope you enjoyed this completely objective review, and I hope you stay away from this game.  I give this game a negative 0/32 worst game I have played in a long time. "
"  Played for 2 hours. Game is broken and devs clearly only care about money and not fixing it.. DO NOT BUY, SCAM ALERT."

"Fills the specific niche where I played Tabletop games with a friend all the time, but now due to college, that can't happen. But thanks to this, we can still play things like Star Fluxx."
Probably the best value for a game I've ever seen other than maybe Orange Box. I'd very highly recommend it.
Copyright infringement simulator.  It's great.
"Perfection in simplicity. Elegance through fluent gameplay. This works better than a lot of systems. It is steam integrated and the workshop will be your main stop for new material.  This is an excellent 'multitool' type of game. There's plenty other, like fantasy grounds. However, this is much more soothing for various reasons. To sum the features up, TableTop Simulator (TTS) flows right once you've learned how to use it.  Any game can be realized in TTS, as long as it uses dice, tokens, chips, cards, models, pen and paper. Want to make a gaming mat for your roleplaying game? Just upload an image of the dungeon and put it on a custom table. And plenty more things that ought to work fine once you get the hang of it.  I definitely recommend this game, and especially for the content that opens up to you at that price."
"Do you want play chess ? or 100+ table games ? And your good friends are too away from you,so they cannot come to you and play table games.Buy this tabbletop game and you dont have to buy physically a lot of table games that you want to play.With workshop support you can play almost every table game."
"I wish i could press the 'like' button a hundred times. BUY THIS GAME, IF U LIKE TABLETOP AND CARD GAMES. IF U ARE DISAPOINTED, I WIL DANCE THE DINASOUR FOR U, A WHOLE WEEK!!!    BUUUUUUUUY THIIIIIIIIIIS GAAAAAAAAAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Tried to play chess. Got distracted and spawned in 20 tablets all playing youtube poops. Really robust system. Tablet/10
pretty good game lol
"This is the game of games. Do you enjoy card games, board games or roll playing games? If so, this is the game for you. Any card game, any board game you can play it. Have an idea for a game? You can test it and you can play it. Go wild. Make a game of flipping tables. Its all fun and games in Tabletop simulator."
"thousands of dollars of MTG decks for $20, werth/10"
This is game is worth every penny! It is the best sandbox indi game since Gmod!

"Reviewing this 'game' feels disingenuous. Because it's not a game. It's a simulator (as the name might suggest). More than that, it's a way to play any tabletop game of your choosing without the hassle of preparing a desk, a game, and all the figures. Moreover, it's a way to play any tabletop game of your choosing online, with your friends, no matter the distance. Anything is possible in virtual space.  There's really no reason to dislike this 'game.' Actions may sometimes be a bit finicky, but the game still feels very smooth and devoid of glitches. You can even use it to design your own tabletop games! How awesome is that? Or you can just ♥♥♥♥ around with random pieces. You can build a pyramid with blocks. You can even use it to play DnD. The options are limitless."
"The game is fantastic. Originally the game was quite a bit buggy and did not have a lot of options. Now it has tons! You can download games, buy games, even create your own. Play with friends, or random players, or mess around in a scene by yourself.  The only true limit the the table size, but with the propper modding you can bypass that limit rather easily, or even turn chessboards into table extensions by locking them into place. It's a great way to play traditionally tabletop games, such as Poker, Monopoly, or even tabletop RPGS. With an easy to use system, it is not hard to learn, with less then a half hour to mostly master it.  The game is rather bug free now and the server system is great.  10/10 Good devs"
"World's first table flipping simulator: Your rules, your tables. I killed a wyvern by flipping the table. My mage fell too, though. I called the game Wyvern Quest - table flipping edition.   You can choose from 9 tables to flip. Wooden tables, a glass table, round tables, hexagon, octagon, even custom tables are possible. Experience the ultimate satisfaction to flip a table. Again and again. Table flipping simulator's tables are quality made. So there's no need visiting your next swedish furniture store. Remember the endless and frustrating hours when you assembled new tables? All gone. Now you have plenty time to flip tables.   Besides that I encourage you to play more than Wyvern Quest. There are thousands of rpgs, board and card games. You can flip it or you can play it on tabletop. It's your choice. This is the ultimate game you have been looking for your whole life.   Keep on flipping! 10/10"
"tabletop simulator is like those shops selling warhammer figurines, board games and pen and paper RPG rulebook . Here you gonna meet a lot of other player with the same interest as you and with a large quantity of games available . I took this game to play some board game with my friends and to have a graphic support for my DnD session . Now i play with stranger at game like warhammer quest ."

"roll 20 or VASSAL with a physics gimmick in case you need it sometimes it gets in the way, sometimes it's necessary  only real downside is that you can't play copywronged games on this, so use something else for that."
Have fun and make you're own rules
"Changed my review, I like this 'game' but I still don't recommend it for casual gamers.  No AI to play against and not many pre-made games, you pretty much have to create your own using scripts.  Edit: oh there are no tutorials for any of the games either, so you'll have to constantly check google in which case don't use full screen mode.  If you have plenty of friends and family then buy it, but it's not for casual gamers who just want to relax."
"There are many reasons that one would enjoy this game. In my opinion, the major reason one would enjoy this game is the same reason people enjoy GMod, and it's that you can do whatever you want with it. You can create things, destory things, and play a diversity of games that should cost way more money then 60 dollars, yet you aren't even spending that much to be able to play them all. THat's all I need to say on the matter."
"If you like tabletop games, buy it now. It's worth every cent from the laughs you will have with your friends while playing with the physics, the ability to make your own games, to the staggering amount of games already available, you will not regret it."
If this doesn't win Game Within A Game Award then I will be very disappointed with the Steam community
This game is great
"'Timeless' - the only word that I need to describe the game, I have played this game over and over again for so many times for some years and would still loved to play it again from scatch. 10/10"
"  It's a extremely good game to chill and just hang out with your friends while playing games in which you could play with them in real life, pretty meta i know, but it's surprisingly better due to the extensive options of things to do from the Steam Workshop, i definitely recommend it."

"This is a great simulator. I have used it in conjunction with the Steam Workshop to both play and publish my own games. There is a TON of worksshop games to look at using with this. Use it with a mic and play with you friends and it is just like sitting around a table throwing dice or playing cards. I'd like to see it grow more though. For instance the ability to edit documents in the game so you can play pen and paper RPGs is lacking. If they add that, D&amp;D and other similiar RPGs will bring it more use.    Also the game uses cloud/online ssources to create/share content which I worry about someone taking down a game and all of sudden I lose a great game. Wish it was more download style so I never lose it, but I'm sure there is reasons it is designed that way so its not a complaint. Overall I would recommend this game for anyone looking to play board games and just can't find the people or time to do it at home."
"This is a really great game. I pretty much only use it for tabletop RPGs like Pathfinder/DnD but it is very solid for that. The level of simulation and organization possible with the game itself coupled with the workshop items people have made (check my subscriptions if you like) is simply astounding. Very high quality work, worth the money, and I will continue using it for some time to come."
