"Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not,  the  best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.   Valkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention?   The story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry look like the MP40 and the STG44, and plenty others), vehicles, and geopolitical conflicts. The character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”.   The gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). With the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes (Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper) rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did).   The game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (basically the weapon looks like an anti-tank rifle, sort of like the Soviet PTRS-41, that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks (if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts is the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them).   The game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful."
"I have played this game fully several times on the PS3 and feel it is one of the best turn-based, strategy RPGs of the last generation. This game is a must own.  They have included full 16:9 resolution support (up to at least 4k I believe), japanese voices and monitor refresh rate matching FPS. Unfortunately the videos are PS3 quality but that is a small complaint for an amazing game.  The story is based in an alternate history 1930's Europe where a mineral called ragnite is used to power vehicles and other items. You are members of the militia of the small, neutral country Gallia which is rich with ragnite and sandwiched between 2 superpowers. You are forced to defend and try to reclaim your country after one of these superpowers invades Gallia for its ragnite. The story is told through cell shaded cut scenes and missions and advances beyond this basic plot as time goes on.  At the start of each mission you pick and place your team on the map and then are provided with command points at the start of each turn which allow you to take direct control of your units. You then move them throughout the map to achive your mission. The mix of strategy and third person controls works very well.  Buy if you would like to see VC2 and VC3 (VC3 unfortunately has never had and english release) come to PC.  9/10"

"It’s hard to figure out where to even begin talking about Valkyria Chronicles; there’s so much to say. Sega’s brilliant take on turn-based tactics is one of my favorite games of the genre, but beyond that I think it’s a very important game. It’s important because the story touches on some of the darkest moments in human history – moments no other game has dared to touch – and does so in an intelligent and sensitive manner. It’s important because of the innovative ways in which it manages to systemize its characterization and themes. It’s important because it marks the last time that Sega put in the care and effort needed to make something unequivocally excellent.  Fans of Japanese games have been let down time and again by PC releases, and when Sega announced that Valkyria Chronicles would be coming to steam we had every reason to expect a buggy, slapdash port. And that would have been a real shame, because with its sketchy watercolor aesthetic the PS3 version is one of the most enduringly beautiful games of the last generation. Fortunately, not only does the PC version of run at 60 frames per second in high definition with nary a hiccup, it also makes several significant enhancements to the original game’s effects. Even better, it condenses the PS3 version’s excruciating loading times to a fraction of a second.   Valkyria Chronicles has a very dense narrative, but to sum it up it’s a steampunk fantasy take on World War II set on the fictional continent of Europa. Europa is embroiled in a conflict between two superpowers – the Atlantic Federation and the Imperial Alliance – over a miraculous mineral fuel called Ragnite. The small, neutral principality of Gallia is invaded by the Empire for their rich deposits of this precious resource. The Empire is also running a campaign of extermination against the Darcsens, a race of pale-skinned, dark-haired people who have become scapegoats for the bulk of Europa’s ills. They kill them indiscriminately and even – here we get to the part of the war that no other game talks about – toss them into concentration camps and work them to death. It’s a little ridiculous that an anime fantasy game is the only AAA title in history with something to say about the Holocaust, but to this game’s immense credit it speaks with the care and respect such a sensitive topic deserves. Furthermore, it covers all of its subject matter with that same care.  If Valkyria Chronicles can be said to have a single overarching theme, it’s that we are all human. The characters under your command, who together comprise Squad 7 of the Gallian Militia’s Third Regiment, are among the best-realized and most likeable characters in gaming history. Squad leader Welkin Gunther is a little socially awkward and obsessed with nature – a trait that sometimes gives him ingenious philosophical and strategic insights. Alicia Melchiott, his second-in-command, is steadfast, caring, and strong-willed. The way that her relationship with Welkin blossoms into romance over the course of the story is positively heartwarming.   But the game doesn’t let us forget that there are people on every side of the conflict. Early scenes in the game which depict the Empire rolling through Welkin’s idyllic home town are framed almost as propaganda, but as the story unfurls we see more and more humanity in the enemy forces, and more evil outside the Empire. When the Federation gets involved in the conflict it causes no end of trouble, and some of the more officious ranking officers in Gallia’s own military pose as much of a threat as the enemy generals.   Instead of seeing this conflict as it happens, we view it through the eyes of historian Irene Koller in her book “On the Gallian Front,” which covers the war from Squad 7’s perspective. Interestingly, Irene’s writing is a little biased, and the game leaves you to wonder how reliable a narrator she really is. Not only is this book a solid framing device for the game’s narrative, it also serves as its interface.   A good interface and good story wouldn’t matter if the game itself was not good, and Valkyria Chronicles is great. On a surface level the game has a lot in common with XCOM. You take command of a military unit comprised of different classes – scouts, engineers, shocktroopers, snipers, lancers, and one tank – and take responsibility for their training as well as their mission performance. On the battlefield success is all about making strategic use of cover and positioning soldiers for the best shot or an effective ambush.   In Valkyria Chronicles soldiers are always on “overwatch,” so they’ll automatically fire on any enemy that enters their range outside their own turn. If you’re smart you can set up ambushes on the enemy’s turn, taking soldiers down before they have a chance to attack and costing the computer an action in the process. Of course if you’re careless the same thing can happen to you. This dynamic makes each of your turns feel almost like an action game.   Anyone who’s played XCOM knows how aggravating it can be to open fire on an alien with a 95% hit chance only to miss entirely. Valkyria Chronicles handles accuracy by putting a circle around your crosshairs representing margin of error, and on top of being more intuitive this creates a wider potential range for success and failure. Instead of assigning a binary hit/miss condition to an entire burst of gunfire, Valkyria calculates each shot individually, so even if you don’t hit enough times to take an enemy down you’ll probably take a chunk out of their health.   Painstaking effort has gone into crafting every aspect of Valkyria Chronicles’ world. This comes across in obvious ways, like the pages upon pages of lore in the glossary that flesh out the setting’s ecology, cultures, and economy, but it also deeply informs the mission design. Every single level is full of little details that help to sell the reality of the world. This isn’t all that surprising considering that the same team created Skies of Arcadia but it’s appreciated nonetheless.   Acting and sound design are just as great as the music. More strict fans of JRPGs will be happy to know that the game includes both English and Japanese voices, but this is one of the few games where the option doesn’t feel needed. The performances for every member of the cast – including all 49 unique, non plot-essential members of Squad 7 – are of the same caliber as you’d expect from the core cast of an Atlus game. Sound effects always make it clear what’s going on and where it’s happening, even if you can’t see it.   The art style in Valkyria Chronicles isn’t just beautiful, it’s enduring. Valkyria Chronicles has aged remarkably well, and in a world where computer graphics advance every other month that’s quite an accomplishment. Another big contributing factor is the game’s animations, which are smooth and very well-crafted, conveying personality through subtle body-language and facial expressions while giving every object and character a correct sense of weight and presence in the world.   In its music, writing, art and acting ,Valkyria Chronicles is brimming with the emotional potency to bring a man to tears. It would make an excellent movie if that were all it had going for it, but the story is told in a way that could only work in a video game, and built on a rock-solid framework of deep and challenging tactical gameplay. Valkyria Chronicles is a timeless classic, and this exceptional PC port only manages to improve upon it."
"Amazing Game. Idk why they didnt release this on pc sooner.  Reasons to get this game: -Fans of the Battalion Wars games may enjoy the artstyle of the game. Although the gameplay is very different. -Amazing, hand drawn art.  -Good music -Great, although cliche story -Customizable armies -Challenging, but fair missions -Old game, but has aged well -great quality for a playstation port -English voiceacting is so cheesy its kinda funny -Japanese voiceacting is well done  Reasons to NOT get this game: -The game is very anime-ey, if you're bothered by 'why is this girl wearing pigtails and not a helmet' you are gonna have a bad time.  -If you don't enjoy the story, or long cutscenes, you will literally be skipping half the game. -The tank driving controls are really awkward to get used to, and even then, bug out sometimes. -The fps can rise or drop really weirdly and dramatically. Since this is mostly turn based strategy it isnt that much of an issue, but still  -The game can get bs difficulty spikes at some point(s) (you all know which point)  Overall, I give it a 9/10. It has some weird quirks, sure. But a really uniquely beautiful, powerful game."
"A port much deserved and actually kind of late which offers the player the ability to lead a squad into battle. If you've enjoyed squad based tactical games such as XCOM, The Fire Emblem Series, FF:Tactics and etc. you will no doubt enjoy this. It brings to the table a very interesting gimmick which allows the player to move their pawns in something called Action Mode. Action Mode puts the player in a third-person perspective control of the pawn allowing the to move them freely as if controlling a character in a third-person game. Despite this it still sticks to turn-based tactical game laws such as a limited amount of movement points and actions within a usage of a 'command Point'. You're offered these 'command points every turn and they can be saved up (there are also ways to get more from the beggining).  There are a large range of characters to add to your squad and it's a pretty large variety, not only in terms of classes but also specific personal traits that affects them on the battlefield(e.g. Pollen Allergy slowly decreases the HP of a character when standing on an are filled with plants; country born gives them more confidence when fighting in the country side; hatred of men discourages them when near male characters in your squad; and so many more). They may also all be equipped with various uniforms and their weapons can be upgraded (but all weapons of that type are upgraded at the same time). Armours adn uniforms too can be upgraded and your squad's tank may also be outfitted with new gear and upgrades. To take out needless hassle the game's level up system is class based. What I mean is that it levels up the entire class and all the characters of that class rather than you having to upgrade each and every one of them. This also means that you won't have to deal with new recruits being underleveled once you've progressed far into the story. To get extra money and experience points when you feel underleveled in the plot missions the game also offers you the option to do skirmishes. Skirmishes are missions that are not attached to the plot and can be done and repeated any time at a difficulty set by the player (soldiers that die in skirmishes will also be out forever just like in story missions so you might want to be careful).  The plot is definitely quite interesting and takes a lot of inspiration from our world's second world war, covering topics such as life during war time, desire for resources and even racism. I won't talk too much about the plot since I'm still going through it and it's usually more interesting to head in knowing as little as possible.  I might return to this review and edit it later on once I've completed the game but from waht I've experienced so far I do not regret buying this at all and wish to see more titles like this be brought to the PC platform in the future."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a pseudo Turn Based Strategy game with real-time action while you move and attack with your units in third-person view. These units can be moved multiple times a turn by spending extra Command Points, but the efficacy of the movement a unit can do decreases each time until the following turn. Units are free to move after they fire, but will be receiving counter fire whilst their turn is active.  Although similar to XCOM, it doesn't share the true 'dice roll' for hits/misses; it does random bullet distribution range on the cross-hair reticule. This range gets smaller as your units are better trained or procure better equipment. Units can take advantage of flanking by attacking units' flanks or the environment. An example of this is destroying sandbags to prevent cover bonuses, leaving enemy units exposed.  You will carefully decide what units to recruit to suit your battles since all of your units are unique to their class type. There are five class types: Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer, Engineer, and Sniper. This is further refined by each unit having their own characteristics that define them from other units within the same class. Some units may not like being near the opposite sex or even prefer being the lone wolf; these nuances provide detriments or bonuses depending on these varying traits. Each class type gains experience through distribution of experience after battles and the entire class type levels up. Therefore, newly recruited units in the game will be of the same strength regardless of when you recruit them. Individual units are further enhanced by 'Potentials' which are unique to each character. They may suddenly gain valor and take less damage from interception fire or even become a dead shot at critical moments. These quirks add to the individual characters and make you either love them or hate them.  After your initial unit deployment, you can even bring in reinforcements should you need a specific class type you may not have deployed or retreat excess units if they aren't doing anything. Certain class types perform better against certain enemies. Another tool in your array is the use of 'Orders' that can turn the tide in some battles or rescue a wounded unit. Orders are very useful, but aren't necessary to win any battles. Your squad units can be permanently killed should you not rescue them when they fall in battle. This game doesn't have auto-save but you are free to save in the middle of a battle and you can have multiple save files.  The game is moderately challenging and has extra bonuses to shoot for, like better grades or even procuring bonus weaponry. There are elite enemy units with unique names that when beaten can drop superior weaponry for you to loot and distribute to your favorite units. The story is very enjoyable and has light-hearted moments besides the usual despair and realities of war. For extra value, there are skirmishes and side-story missions for many characters you can take on at your leisure, not to mention the included DLC which adds more of these bonus story bits."
"  Summary    It maintains by having a lasting appeal with a diverse set of memorable and unique characters, a satisfyingly emotional and well thought out story with simple, yet strategic gameplay that offers freedom through various tactics. Despite all of this, there are certainly questionable flaws, yet they're completely smothered with the games overarching enjoyment and charm which ultimately pushes the game in a familiar but fresh direction.    Story    Valkyria Chronicles takes place in a fantasy setting similar to Earth which introduces the story with two waging superpowers, the autocratic East Europan Imperial Alliance and the loosely-united democracies of the Atlantic federation. This engagement is known as the EW2 or the Second Europan War. Both powers are reliant on a resource called Ragnite which fuels and controls both factions economies. Overtime, the Ragnite lessened and became more scarce causing the Empire to declare war against the Federation, sparking the EW2.   In the midst of all this, the neutral state of Gallia was invaded due to its unfortunate but overflowing of rich Ragnite deposits as the Empire came crashing down with its invigorated momentum. In the initial invasion of Bruhl, where we meet our notable and well-meaning hero, Welkin Gunther as he's forced to take up arms and put aside his interests as a teacher in order to survive alongside the towns captain, Alicia Melchiott. The two end up joining the militia and Welkin unwittingly becomes the leader of his now profound group, Squad 7.   The squads involvement through the story is told through cut scenes in episodes and chapters as you progress throughout a book. While it's effective and different, it has a disjointed narrative that emphasizes visuals throughout the book. Here, for someone who loves backstory and reading, you can learn about each distinct character you meet and their personal history through various tabs, a weapons and machinery tab as well as some background if you're curious about past and present missions. It's sophisticated and quite delicate but you will start to understand how the plot slowly unfolds and progresses through various chapters and cutscenes. There are also emotional and genuinely heartfelt moments within the game (no spoilers, of course) that made me realize I've come to adore and appreciate these particular characters.    Visuals    The art has a watercolour painting style that suits with some crosshatching textures and smooth edges, it without a doubt ensures to look like no game you've seen before with outstanding quality as if it fits right with the theme and driven storyline. I believe you'll actually recognize and enjoy the beauty as you delve further into the game. The game so far runs very fluidly and can maintain a high frame rate no matter the occurance on screen. The pastel color palette is light and lucid, much of it looks gorgeous and in particular charming due to it's onomatopoeias that splatter your screen during combat and events such as lobbing a grenade, you'll probably see something like 'Blam!' to go up acknowledging that your grenade has detonated. Little things like this makes the game much more action-packed, similar to comics.    Audio    Great sound design with various sound effects, the brilliantly composed music and a well established soundtrack that impacts emotion and bringing an understanding, all fits into the theme of the game from storming the enemies fortifications, to enduring the loss of someone close or even having special moments and interactions with characters. It makes the world not only more lively but built upon by setting the tone, a place that you care about based on what's playing in the background.    Gameplay    Like with other tactical role-playing games, Valkyria Chronicles has a similar but different formula and separates itself among many others that pigeon hold you with a much more demanding and limited playstyle of map grids and restrictive movement. As such, you start by deploying five of the different classes into the field, dependent on what the current objective is. For example, taking out a tank would be the Lancers job due to their resilient armor and slow but heavy firepower while the fragile Scouts tend to be your bread and butter as offense or defense since they have lot of versatility, both individually and in groups. Once you're deployed, an overhead map displays with all your troops (Command Mode), but the camera zooms into third-person control (Action Mode) for each individual unit you decide to move on. From here on out, once you're in third-person, you now have a gauge bar that determines how far you can move as well as one form of action, whether it be healing another ally, shooting an enemy or repairing your Edelweiss (your only tank).  It certainly retains much of the challenge of tradition of the genre while at the same time, expelling limitations we've come to know such as forced grinding and overpowered fights that you must complete otherwise there'll be a lack of progression. You're able to reuse character as many times as you'd like though movement will be hindered each time and ammo may also come in slowly if you're using Snipers and Lancers (prevent obvious exploiting). Some maps also bring fresh ideas hurled at you like sandstorms (reduced viewing distance) and searchlights (mortars land in the area once spotted), which leads to considerations, such as unit weaknesses and cover (you can hide behind sandbags). There's a variety of special character specific missions that require you to use the environment with various obstacles in your way such as trenches or scattered landmines.  The most forgiving part is it isn't difficult to get into because of how uncommon the user-friendly features are. You can save throughout battles as it helps immensely if you made a mistake like misplacing a shot or if someone unexpectedly gets killed, you still have within three turns to either reload a save or simply calling a medic. It's possible to lose anyone considering but it's best not to as each member of your squad has their own background and individuality that separates each one with different potentials, status bonuses depending on certain situations and abilities based on their character or personality which makes for a very diverse and interesting team of Squad 7. This is due mainly to spark some interest and drawing narrative into elevating and unique individuals.    Final Thoughts    It's praised individuality and sense of similarity but different and fresh direction, the smart care and passion of the developers, make this as one of the most delightful and unique experiences. Despite its few flaws such as having questionable AI or crashing on an earlier mission (was forced to turn off steam overlay), it's more than enough to make it forgiving and looking past them. It's a fantastic game that has a lot of heart and shouldn't be passed up."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a modern JRPG with a rich story that features life-sized characters, full-animation, and voice acting.  Valkyria Chronicles is a unique, yet familiar turn-based strategy game. You have access to a map where you can view and select your units. When you select a unit, you have to control that unit from a 3rd person perspective and manually aim your shots at the enemy units.  We need more games like this!"
"To start off, Valkyria Chronicles is a great game! It's good to see Sega starting to take an interest in putting some of their former console exclusives on Steam.  STORY:  The game takes place in a fantasy version of World War 2 Europe. This is a pretty interesting setting, and one I think is vastly underused in RPGs in general. A brief synopsis is that a small neutral country called Gallia is invaded by The Empire (read: fantasy Germany) during the Empire's war with the Federation, and the game follows the experiences of a junior Gallian officer and his squad as they fight to ensure their country's freedom. Overall, the various characters are written in a way that is relatable and engaging, and the game avoids relying too much on stereotypical Anime character tropes. I particularly like the way the game handles the villains. The game takes the time to portray characters from the Empire- both leaders and common soldiers- as humans, with their own motiviations, flaws, and even some redeeming qualities, and it manages to do so without whitewashing the villainous acts they do.  This nuance in character portrayal is very important, as the game does not shy away from some of the awful stuff that happened in the real war. The game portrays both the pervasive racism and bigotry that characterized the countries involved in WW2, and it even touches on concentration camps and racial cleansing. The game mostly handles these topics with the amount of gravity and seriousness they deserve, and only rarely seems melodramatic or clumsy. However, the decision to cast the Japanese-looking 'Darcsen' as the game's stand-ins for the oppressed minorities of World War 2 Europe does have a few unfortunate implications vis-a-vis the victim complex that a certain real-world segment of Japanese society has about WW2. Overall, though, I'm still glad the game had the courage to address some of the more uncomfortable aspects of war, and I think its successes in this regard outweigh its failings.  Now, this IS still a JRPG, and some elements of the story and setting will seem hilariously out of place to you if you're not intimate with the genre. For starters, the magic rocks that power all Europan technology should clue you in that the game doesn't stick particularly close to history. The first half of the game mostly presents combat in a believable manner, but later story missions can't help but start to throw in some over-the-top Anime style bosses, and the introduction of a certain techno-magic later in the game's story might stretch suspension of disbelief for some.  GAMEPLAY:  The game is basically broken up into two different types of play: 'book mode' and battles. In book mode, the player basically just watches cutscenes that advance the story; each scene is fairly short, about 2-4 minutes, and there are about 10-12 scenes per chapter in the game. Each scene is self contained, and there is a mostly linear progression through the scenes, where you have to watch each scene to unlock the next one.  At least once per chapter, you will unlock a battle that must be completed sucessfully to advance the story. Each battle is basically a set-piece engagement where you deploy your units at a starting point on a map, and then take turns with the enemy until you meet your objectives (or lose, I guess, but the game isn't that hard in most cases). Each story mission can only be played once, but you will periodically unlock skirmish battles that can be played any number of times to farm experience and cash. Combat is basically like a turn-based strategy RPG, but there are a few major differences from other tactical JRPGs you may have played.   First off, unlike most other RPGs where each unit you control gets to take one action per player turn, instead you get a set amount of 'command points' every player turn, which you can then distribute to your units at will, to take actions, give buffs (called 'orders'), or call reinforcements. One 'action' consists of both a move and a shoot- the shoot can be taken at any time during movement. This is all fairly straightforward except for one major caveat: you can give more than one action to a given unit per turn! In fact, if you want, you can give ALL your action points to a single unit to move/shoot a whole bunch of times. Getting A-ranks on missions often requires pooling most of your actions on just a few units, to quickly penetrate deep behind enemy lines and achieve objectives.  This approach to combat is more realistic than average for JRPGs, but still, don't expect it to feel at all like a gritty war simulator like the Company of Heroes games. Cover matters- enemies will take potshots at you if you run around within their range, and enemies can't shoot you if you're behind a wall or a friendly tank (or even an enemy tank). Controlling your own tank feels suitably tanky- big, powerful, and slow as hell. Actually shooting feels a little simplistic though. Basically, you take aim, then your unit empties their clip at your aimpoint, and then the guy you shot (if you hit him, and if he's still alive) gets a chance to return fire. Headshots are important, at least.  Secondly, while it's definitely an RPG and not a straight turn-based tactical game, the RPG elements take a backseat to the tactical ones. Levelling up your characters gives you some nice bonuses- it unlocks some secondary weapons and orders, character bonuses called 'potentials', and gives small increases to HP- but you can easily complete the game without any of the optional stuff, and the exp you earn in story missions will be sufficient to beat the game without grinding skirmish battles.  TECHNICAL:  This is a very good port. Keyboard controls can be remapped, the game can scale the in-battle/menu graphics to any resolution, and framerate is NOT locked. Unfortunately though, some of the cutscenes are prerendered at the 720p resolution of the PS3, and these cutscenes take up a lot of disk space- the game is a 20 GB install. The game is mostly alt+tab friendly, except when in combat- I sometimes have to start Task Manager to take focus away from the game then. The game is stable, but it sometimes doesn't shut down cleanly. I've never lost any save data that way, but it's a little annoying.  The artstyle is obviously very anime-eqsue, it's presented in a sort of washed-out cellshaded style. Maybe not everyone's favorite style, but at least it's unique and visually distinctive. I personally like it a lot! Also, the voiceacting is generally good. The Japanese voice actors are great, as are the English voiceactors for all the main characters. Some of the secondary characters can sound like they just phoned it in, though.  OVERALL: 8/10  PROS: -Compelling and under-used setting for a JRPG -Interesting story -Good voiceacting -Fun combat -No grind necessary! -Just as much challenge as you want- completing the game isn't hard, getting all A-ranks is! -Great port- runs smoothly  CONS: -Large install -Some cutscenes are only 720p -Some anime/jrpg cliches are present"
"The fact I called in sick on the day Sega decided to sneakily (and quietly) release one of the greatest strategy RPGs ever conceived, are definitely not related.....honest."
"I shall now proceed to write unbridled and unambiguous praise for this game.    Valkyria Chronicles  is a triumph. It is a triumph in gameplay, style, presentation, sound design, narrative, character development, exposition and content. The game combines the illustrious production values of AAA titles with innovative gameplay quirks usually found in more obscure indie titles. Yet, it doesn’t compromise for even an inch. It delivers a style that uniquely its own and that might not appeal to everyone, but it sure has hell makes an exceptionally appealing case for itself.   If you’re a fan of turn based rpg tactics like  Heroes of Might and Magic  or  Fire Emblem  you will often find yourself in a minority crowd. It is a rather specific genre that many mainstream publishers don’t even want to look at it. Sega however took a bold stance and had  Valkyria Chronicles  developed and published. Not only is it a turn based rpg tactics game, it also breaks the mold on that genre to become a hybrid of turn based and real time. Part shooter, and part chess. The blend is so unique there is nothing quite like it outside of the series itself.  You control a small squad of soldiers. Each turn you’re given a number of action points. By selecting a soldier you expend the point and are given real time control of the unit. You can then move around the map. You only see enemy units on the map if any of your own units currently have a clear line of sight in that area, so you might run into unforeseen threats while exploring. When you’ve found your mark, you can hit the aim button and line up a shot. Your unit will empty a clip and then the enemy might retaliate, granted that you didn’t murder him in the first place. When moving, you deplete a movement gauge. When the gauge is empty your unit will be rooted to the ground and cannot move and you’ll be forced to expend an extra command point to move your unit. You’ll have to take range into account when moving. If you run out in enemy crossfire you’ll most likely lose your unit in the next turn. Additionally, units come in different shapes and sizes. Scouts are fast and nimble, but generally miss the firepower and endurance to break enemy entrenchments. Shocktroopers are the opposite of scouts. They tire much faster, but pack a serious wallop and can take one too. Lancers specialise in destroying enemy armour units, and the engineers provide support to your own tanks and troops. The sniper unit does what it says on the tin; it takes out single units with pinpoint accuracy.  However, your units are all unique, each soldier is a character with its own traits and abilities. You develop their talents by letting them perform in the line of duty, and by training them by expending experience points. You also have to equip them with new and better gear. You’re always busy with maintaining your army, be it out in the field or back at base; a commander’s duty never ends.  The missions are also very well executed. Most maps feature a unique obstacle that needs to be overcome. This keeps the gameplay fresh as you make your way through the enemy ranks. You’ll fight in the desert, the streets, beaches, forests, canyons and in fortresses. The variety is excellent and you’ll quickly learn to adapt you tactics and squad accordingly.   Speaking of the commander, the game’s story focusses on Lieutenant Welkin Gunther and his squad of militia men and women. The small nation of Gallia is caught amidst a continent wide conflict as the eastern Europan Empire invades and begins to violently subjugate the nation. Welkin and his fellow countrymen are drafted into service to repel the invaders. At the same time they discover important clues about the country’s history and its former rulers: The Valkyria; near mythical people with incredible powers.  The setting draws parallels with our own Second World War. Complete with ethnic scourges and totalitarian ideologies. Furthermore, the game takes its time to give you exposition. Many of the secondary characters get room to develop alongside the main man and lady. Most stages are bookended, with intro cut scenes beforehand, and an outro afterward. All cut scenes are fully voiced by an anime competent cast, so they’re familiar with the style of material and do an excellent job at conveying the moments the best they can. Even when the natively Japanese expositional style doesn’t exactly suit the moment. I’ve never found a need to switch the voices to Japanese. This is one of the key points where  Valkyria Chronicles  scores. Its approach to its narrative is not like a Hollywood movie like  Saving Private Ryan , but more like a TV series, like  The Pacific . It takes its time and lets you experience it at your own pace.   The entire game is presented in the form of a journal. Ever chapter takes place on a set of pages, where every ‘photo’ represents a cut scene, and every map equals a stage. You can flip through the journal’s tabs to find the entries on each separate character and other glossary entries. It’s a great way of presenting the story and its lore and mythos. You’re free to explore, or never even look at it. The book is a neat way of presenting the game, but the real captivator are the graphics. The characters and environments are fashioned in an extremely stylish and gorgeous watercolour and pencil sketch manner. Not only does it suit its anime tone, it also stands the test of time. Even now, seven after its PS3 release, the graphics hold up and will probably hold up for a long time coming.  Accompanied with the visual package comes a very smart and elegant sound design. Every sort of bullet impact has a distinct noise, so you know when your unit is in direct danger, even if you can’t see the origin of the gunfire. The music is a romantic, tense and sweeping score that really underscores the game’s every moment. From the tense high stakes cover shootouts, to the emotional and heart wrenching moments, that despite of all your tactical prowess, will inevitably befall you.  These moments are where game is at its strongest; and where the art, gameplay and sound work together in a perfectly orchestrated and coordinated union that not just elevates the game at hand, but the medium as a whole.  Valkyria Chronicles  seizes the player for a unique experience that will change the way RPG tactics, narratives and presentation are perceived in video games "
"Unexpectedly great port of an older PS3 title. Silky smooth sixty frames per second, good keyboard and mouse control, and you can even run it at 4k resolution, it even has Japanese audio included if you don't want to subject yourself to the phoned in English voice cast. Very encouraging. With all the DLC included for only twenty dollars it's a good deal for anyone who was interested in the title but didn't want to invest in the PS3 edition of the game.  That said, the small problems from the console version are present here. Cutscenes are imported directly and stick at 720p and cannot be altered, so expect jaggies for that. Also cutscenes must be manually selected for some reason, instead of playing one longer scene you will watch three smaller scenes divided equally, bit confusing and unnecessary. Upgrading is mostly a linear path, but does let you enjoy a few small, effective combinations (such as some weapons causing status effects, aiming/handling better and enjoying more firepower). Your giant tank enjoys standard upgrades as well as a seperate 9x9 grid system (small upgrades are 1x1, medium are 2x1, etc). The emphasis on turn systems means you will be rushing every mission to nab XP bonuses, making most missions a simple cut and run affair. Also a minor irritation but there is no auto-save feature, meaning if you forget to save and then lose a battle you'd better hoped you're not in for a few hours of redos.  Gameplay is still very engaging and strategic with dozens of playable characters (each with their own likes/dislikes and advantages/quirks) to allow you a large range of freedom about who you want in your team and with how you want to enjoy the game. That said, enemies will never, ever stop shooting you when a character is selected. They are relentless. Meaning as soon as you pick a character in the heat of combat you will probably shatter your keyboard/controller to get to that aim key. (Which makes them all stop shooting you amusingly enough). If a character is downed and then touched by an enemy, that's it, they're gone forever. So plan accordingly! The Tank you command also does not mesh well with keyboard+mouse controls on inclines, causing your tank to spin or fidget in place and waste it's movement.   Plot is typical anime-fare but you shouldn't really let that prevent you from enjoying the slick combat and tactical emphasis. It does lead to some hokey and typical 'trope' moments but it's not groan-inducing or irritating. Our protagonist is relateable and most of his team (even the smaller members) have personalities thanks to the personnel tab. Some cutscenes can go on a little much, and expect to hear about how war is a bad thing (Well it is) while a bizarre little 'flying pig' irritates you with it's strangely human oinking.   Great game, very well done port. Thumbs up. See you on the battlefield."
"The Good  - A great port of a fantastic game - Scratches an XCOM type of itch - Good voice acting whether you roll with the English or Japanese dub - Approachable, but challenging gameplay - Every soldier is unique. You'll grow familiar with their traits and abilities and potentially become attached to them. They can die for good if you're not careful - Gorgeous art style, engine, and character designs - Great soundtrack - About 45-50 hours long, a good amount of RPG type progression, and replayable missions. Lots of value here  The Bad  - A good amount of pre-rendered cutscenes (75% of the install is movie files), a few of which look genuinely great and are justified in being pre-rendered, but others are just straight up recorded in-engine footage at 720p, jaggies and all. None of this looked out of place in the PS3 version, but at 1080p and above it can look kinda gross - Some animations during 'conversation scenes' play too fast at 60fps and above. Reaction fire doubles at 60fps, though most view this as a positive change to the balance of the game. Going any higher than 60fps isn't recommended - The trading card art and the profile backgrounds are all horrendous quality, which is a shame given how beautiful the art for this game is - Not every mission in the game is a winner  Review has been updated since there have been a few patches."
"I do not own a console since the early nineties and I never owned a PlayStation in my life. In such regard, I consider myself a PC purist.  While I do enjoy Tactical RPG games, I am not really into Japanese made games, let alone anime and manga, is just not my cup of tea. In fact, I never heard about Valkyria Chronicles™ until I saw the game announced here in Steam.  Having said that, I am writing this short review to say that I have enjoyed this game a lot, not just for the tactical gameplay but mainly for the story. While not perfect at all, the gaming experience is top-notch.  Another outstanding area is the port. I have seen countless ports from consoles to PC that are so bad. I always try to avoid them, but whoever did the port for Valkyria Chronicles™ did a hell of a job. As someone that play exclusively with a keyboard/mouse, this was perfectly made.  I am glad this PS3 game from 2008 was ported to PC on 2014 and I am now looking forward to see more ports from PS3 greatest hits."
"This game is so focused on the story I wouldn't recommend it to anyone not willing to spend a lot of time watching cutscenes. That said it is a very nice story about a squad during a war and how they helped to stop it. The battles play out with unit selection and picking where to start them from predesignated spots. There are several different unit types each with different stats,weapons, and skills. The game can be very difficult when you are just starting out and trying to figure out what each class can do and when to use them but after a few hours and lots of trial and error this becomes less of an issue. During my first few hours I found a lot of the combat very frustrating, although after that I began to really enjoy it. After a battle you earn money and xp which you can spend on training your troops and upgrading weapons and your tank. I ended up having to grind a bit on the skrimishes but I think that was mostly my issue of just being bad. While the gameplay is solid the story is what really sells the game. As it progresses the characters are fleshed out really well, especially if you watch the optional stuff. If you want to learn even more about any individual character other than what the cutscenes show every usable character has a page long back story.  The graphics are unique, cell shading with anime characters, and its pretty pleasant on the eyes. This game is a solid pc port akin to a story focused xcom. If you can handle the frustration of some of the more difficult missions and not mind the seemingly large gaps of dialogue and cutscene between action I would recommend you take a look at this.  Edit: This is super embarrassing, I recieved a review copy of this game, I disclosed it on my curator page but forgot to here. Sorry everyone! I don't think it affected my judgement of the game but I like to let everyone know."
Do you like X-COM? Do you like anime? Do you like shooting Nazis in the face? Do you like cute girls that make you bread! THEN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!!!  -10/10 would eat bread again!  Edit: The only question now is will we get to eat bread again in VC II &amp; III on Steam?

"Start playing as baker girl. She kills someone, and makes a cute victory pose. Squad is now only girls. Watch psychopathic teenage girls slaughter men in armor with refreshing smiles. Realize why the game is called Valkyria."
"Valkyria Chronicles is - or rather, used to be - one of the best and most underappreciated early PS3 exclusives, in the same category as Demon's Souls. I've fully completed the game and its DLC on console, and can't wait to do so again on PC.  In terms of genre, Valkyria Chronicles offers a unique combination of turn-based strategy, RPG-like character progression and equipment upgrades, and third person movement in battles. Since apparently that - quite impressive in its own right - wasn't enough for Sega, it also comes with a unique stroke-based art style and rendering engine, and an interesting alternative universe WW1-like setting. Topping it all off is a great and memorable soundtrack and selectable dual audio voice acting.  The PC port is solid, with the only major issue being the pre-rendered cutscene videos, which are stuck at PS3 quality. The game performs really well even on modest systems, and scales up beautifully to high resolutions on more powerful ones.  Anyone at all interested in turn-based strategy games would do well to check out this title, particularly its very fair price on Steam considering the size of the game and the inclusion of all DLC."
Drafted a 12 year old into my squad. 10/10 would Kony again
"Even if I paid this game at its full price, I still feel it should have worth more than that Steam needs more game like this, honestly  Update: I got a -75% coupon for this game so I sold my CS:GO skins to buy it for a friend of mine cuz it's too good that he must play it"
"40+ hours strategy game filled with intensive battles, love, hate, sadness, betrayal, fanservice &amp; bread baking. Thank you, Sega!"
"I've always wanted to try this game since I saw its release on PS3... But when I heard it was going to be released for PC, I jumped on the occasion to get it. But enough with my personal motives.  Here's my pros, cons and misc  Pros: -Decent Story -Nice Graphics (A shame that it's still PS3 quality) -Far from being the worse PC port from Japan(By god they did some horrid work) -Decent game mechanics -One of the only games that has the stones to put the idea of the concentration camps -Jan Walker made me laugh my ♥♥♥ off -Can switch between english and japanese voices  Cons: -Still feels a bit awkward to control with a keyboard -Some forgetable characters -Occasional odd lag(I can't explain better because it just pops out of nowhere and then gets back to normal)  Misc: -Occasional inconsistencies in clothing and such with 1930-era -Florist gone sadistic psycho made me laugh.  Overall, I recommend this good port to anyone who likes tactical Jrpgs, plus with a not to heavy price tag."
"In Short: This is not only a good game for itself, but also a good port. It has a few flaws, but they're not that bad.  As stated on the store page, it already includes all the DLC of the PlayStation 3-Version for free, uses the Steam Cloud for your saves, has Achievements and includes Trading Cards. You can play the game in 16:9 Full HD and 60fps, using either a controller or Keyboard/Mouse. Although you can only navigate the menus using the Keyboard, you can use the Mouse on the Battlefield when controlling a character, which makes it quite comfortable to aim or look around.  Sure, the game has its flaws, but the story is wonderful and full of emotions, there are so many characters with their own personality, there's tons of interesting background information, it has nice graphics, a cinematic soundtrack and the gameplay is just a lot of fun. If you're a fan of Strategy-RPGs or wanted the game when it was out on PS3 and did not have the possiblity to play it, you shouldn't miss this game now.  By the way, you should really play this game with japanese dub. You can change the voice from english to japanese in the Settings on the Title Screen. The japanese dub just has so much more emotion and improves your experience of the story A LOT.  (In-depth review in german is available on my website.)"
"Bought for my ps3, played the hell out it beat it went back and played again. Bough for my PC will be playing the hell out of it, will play the hell out of it again. Amazing artstyle, graphics,music, and gameplay. 10/10"
"This is probably one of the few games that still looks good even though it’s an old game. It felt like a mix of XCOM EU and The Bureau: XCOM Declassified but this game was made 4 years before them, I’m very impressed (with anime storyline and artsyle). I will make this review simple and just put up the pros and cons of it Pros:   It scrapped the grid by grid system from most similar turn based strategy game and it actually felt great, you have the freedom to move the character anywhere you want   A really good port, no doubt. It runs great and the controls for mouse and keyboard is good   Battles are always challenging and you need to change your tactic to every battle and adapt with the enemies    The orders system can help you a lot in a battle    Interesting characters (If you’re bothered to read the character glossary but the main characters are interesting enough without reading them imo)   Cons:   Sometimes the menu felt clunky, for example you can’t change your character equipment in the middle of briefing before battle and you have to exit the briefing and go to headquarters, only then you can change your characters equipment. It’s gets a little bit annoying sometimes   Sometimes there’s like an invisible wall on someplace even though your sniper clearly have a line of sight on the enemy but thankfully it’s compensated with the crosshair which turns red only when you have nothing blocking you   New game+ for the main storyline lacks challenge since they don’t change the enemy difficulty so that you can just plough through the mission in like a single turn until somewhere above chapter 10 but it’s compensated with hard and expert skirmishes so I guess it’s alright   Crashes randomly at some point (it’s rare but it does happens)   Cover systems feels lacking, you can only get into cover on sandbags and trenches    It’s amazing that this game was made 6 years ago, the gameplay doesn’t feel dated at all. This game is probably one of the hidden gems of the PS3 era. I weren't a fan of the series but definitely I am now, hope to see the sequels get a proper port on PC as well"
"The next step for turn-based strategy. Incredibly fun, and absolutely charming.  I'd heard XCom's Julian Gollop had sung this game's praises back in 2010, saying that Valkyria's system was almost exactly what he had in mind for his never-released Dreamland Chronicles. Valkyria's combat definitely feels like a big step forward from the XCom back-and-forth, adding an element of intensity and immediacy to the short burts of action that take place during each movement you choose. The moment you make your move, you take command of that unit and execute the move in real time. Enemy units cannot move or attack until it is their turn, but they can REact, laying down bursts of fire if you draw within range. It goes a long way toward bridging the gap between action and strategy you tend to get in turn-based titles.  The plot is better than I expected, but it's nothing particularly interesting. I was a little interested in the Darcsen storyline, as it was implied they actually caused an ancient disaster which spurred generations of racism, so that was a pretty good element. I also found myself more interested in the political landscape of WORLD WAR ANIME than I thought I'd be.  The characters are the real endearing element here - everyone has wildly different personalities, touched with weird and charming quirks that manifest into battle. The close-range shocktrooper Jane gets an anti-personnel 'sadism' buff if she kills enough nazis, but runs into a defense-lowering debuff if she walks on a paved road (since she USED to be a nature-loving pacifist). Others have wildly bizarre powers, like an unmotivated engineer whose gun randomly jams because she's too lazy to clean it, or a ditzy valley girl who loses accuracy due to gabbing with nearby soldiers. You find yourself choosing soldiers that have glaring tactical problems, just because you like their personalities so much. For the most part, however, buffs and debuffs are pretty well balanced.  It adds a ton of much-needed flavor to a section of turn-based strategy that is usually very calculated and bland. Very fun.  I haven't been this taken with a title for a very long time. Very much recommended, and hopefully we'll see Sega release another proper sequel."
"XCOM: Waifu edition  Joking aside, this game is a true gem. I actually love it more than XCOM: EU or EW and I really love those games. The game is pretty straight forward from a turn based perspective game. However, unlike XCOM for example, you level up classes rather than particular characters. Meaning the recruits you get will all be the same strength in terms of firepower and action points and the like. However, different recruits have differen't characteristics. This ranges from being racist and not wanting to be near certain members, or allergies, pretty much every possible pro or con you think would actually influence people's actions. They all have their friends, and will commonly fight harder to protect those friends. Some of them are panicky, and not everyone has the same amount of health despite being the same class and having the same upgrades. Unlike XCOM where you have to individually give equipment to each squad member, in this it becomes the general issue equipment for each class. So you'll only have to focus on the personalities and characteristics of the characters, and not what their equipment is. The story is extremely good and episodic based, LOTS of cutscenes if you like that, but the combat is rewarding and enjoyable.    The true endearing factor of Valkyria Chronicles is the diversity of characters. Having a character who hates the enemy and is sadistic and gets excited to end their lives for example. Ditzy valley guys or girls who get distracted because they're so chatty in combat. Each character feels unique, you're not leading professional soldiers, you're leading civilians who have to begin to face the horrors of war. These are militiamen, and they begin to evolve into true soldiers as time goes on. Once a pacifist, now a hardened veteran and able soldier. It feels like you're honestly leading characters with personalities, rather than some copy and pasted hard-♥♥♥ grunt who's vast lexicon of responses is 'Roger, Engaging, and Moving' Whilst I feel those hard soldier types seen in XCOM and other military games are fine. I do have to say I prefer to see human aspects to an otherwise cold hearted soldier type.   The game is undeniably human, much like the Metal Gear series, it has a very anti-war sentiment to it. Trying to drive home the geo-political intricacies of racism, history, and human emotions. It's a war story with an anime aesthetic, there's quite a few times where I get hit by the feel train.  However, they still managed to fit a pig with wings in here. Albeit it still can't fly"
"I definitely recommend this game. It is a faithful port, if not better, of the PS3 version since it runs smoothly and the fps is not capped at all (it looks like 60fps).  If you are a fan of turn-based strategy games and games which have great storylines (trust me, this one has a great storyline), this is a must-get.  Now if only Steam would port the other games as well..."
"If X-Com was an anime, and alien invaders were anime Germans, then you'd get a game like Valkyria Chronicles."
"I'm not really Anime. I thoroughly dislike the World War 2 setting. But I heard friends I trust rave about the game, and figured I'd give it a shot.  Bloody hell is this amazing. The combat manages to be both deeply strategic and beautiful fun, the gameplay has an absolute unique look to it and every single one of your soldiers has their own fully voiced back story and personalities.  This is a gorgeous turn-based strategy/RPG mix I never expected to find from a japanese console port.  Highly recommended. Play this. Your gaming experience will be richer for it."
"Want a game with XCOM style gameplay but has good story? Want an anime game that isn't stupid? Want to have your medals presented by a princess, accompanied by a box of weapons?  Valkyria Chronicles is for you."
"What can I say?, Its Fire Emblem with guns."
"This game...well first off. Let me just say. Square...learn from these guys how to port. Thank you.  Secondly...this game is not only visual gorgeous, the music is great, options and port are amazing.   It combines my love of games like Xcom. RTS and tactics styled combat, with RPG flavor and story to really..just draw you into an alternate world with their version or world war 2.   this game is addicting as hell and I reccomend buying it.  Special thanks to my friend Guunie for gifting me this gem"
"You're on the tank now...  Valkyria Chronicles is an interesting game for sure. Not only it's a weird genre mix making it very hard to describe, but also there are many strong and weak points worth discussing in both gameplay and story.  Story excels at world building. Not-Europe at not-World War II is a very interesting and compelling setting on it's own. There is also ton of flavor text, both written and voice acted, going miles to give, for example, characterization of every soldier you can command in the game, with quirky personalities included. World overall is really inviting. That said, core plot has some very noticeable problems. One: it tries to tell a war-themed story in probably most non-violent way possible, implementing massive amount of well-known anime clichés, where Spec Ops: The Line simply eviscerated and deconstructed this genre to the bare-bones. It leaves the game without cohesive message and consequence, making it hard to take serious. Add pretty long cutscenes to the mix and you will receive something that not everyone can stomach. I ultimately liked it, but everybody wanting a serious story or having an anime allergy, take caution.  Gameplay is a weird mix of strategy game, RPG and third-person shooter. I would compare it to Worms, Fallout 3's V.A.T.S. system and Supergiant Games’ Transistor. Many others also use X-Com as a reference. The gameplay may have some 'first-installment-oddities' like: unbalanced classes, clueless buff/debuff system, slow leveling requiring additional skirmish battles (just to keep on par with the enemies), annoying randomness and unexplained mechanics... BUT at the end it's real, genuine fun and battles feel like chess matches. Tanks are awesome, sniping enemies from distance is awesome and owning the AI in pretty hard battles is awesome too. It's a solid gameplay worth your interest if the description feels compelling for you.  Music? Top notch! Japanese people certainly know how to make symphonic music. I also cannot say a bad thing about graphics that have their own charming style. This cell-shading will not age quickly. I also commend a good PC port, free DLC, New Game+ mode and good content/price ratio (even with long cutscenes, 32 hours for one playthough is pretty neat result).  Valkyria Chronicles is a weird mix, but for those who want to take risk, it may be a bullseye. Not for everyone, especially those with low anime tolerance, but definitely worth a look for the uniqueness sake alone."
"Incredibly well optimized port for one best games on the PS3.     Unique strategic gameplay.    Unique graphic style.    Huge cast of memorable characters.    Many ways to customize and form your squad.    Edy is best girl!   Seriously, if you missed out on it before, don't miss out now. It's one of those few games that really stand out and stay in your memory forever."
"Back on 2008, Valkyria Chronicles came out to very little to no fanfare and it quickly became one of the 'hidden gems' of gaming for the PS3. Then quickly after that, Sega produced two more sequels on the PSP and then other spinoffs on mobile platforms. Not to mention, the game was originally developed for the Xbox 360 but Sega decided to make it for the PS3 instead, considering they weren't seeing much support for the project from Microsoft and they wanted to cater to the Japanese audience. So needless to say, it has had quite a history until its PC release.  Regarding the port itself, it's quite fantastic. Other than a few audio issues where gunfire and character voices in-game may not be as loud as they were on the PS3 version and how the cutscenes are still in their original 720p video format, everything about this port is an improvement. The relatively flat, water-color aesthetic of the game means that upscaling them to modern PC resolutions results in a very crisp look. The conversion from 30 frames per second to 60 is quite stunning to behold as well. Especially for a VC fanatic like me. So I'm glad that new fans of this franchise will get quite an amazing visual experience.  For the game itself, it is a really fantastic mix of seriousness of war to the colorful characterizations of anime. It strikes a great balance between cartoony fantasy (moments of character comedy, light moments with off-days of the soldiers, fantastical mythology and lore) and World War 2 style seriousness (replete with themes of racism, genocide, Jewish persecution and corruption and evils of war). What I absolutely adore about this series is they don't mingle too much into one mindset and you are going to get a lot of funny moments and serious moments in very balanced doses throughout. So if you want a certain variety of emotions and scenarios in a game, the Valkyria Chronicles series is for you. Aside from the theme itself, the combat system BLiTZ (Battle of Live Tactical Zones) is an elegant mix of real time 3rd person shooter and turn based strategy you have to play to believe in how well they come together. The combat system may sound like a weird coupling, but only a few minutes of getting used to the system, you will fall in love with this elegant combat system even if you are a jaded strategy game fan.  Honestly, the game still stands the test of time regarding its unique gameplay engine, likable characters (This game has lineage with the likes of Sakura Wars, so character interaction is their bread and butter) and a lovely story and lore complemented by the incredible music by the legendary Hitoshi Sakimoto of other legendary strategy titles like Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre.  So if you want to support an underdog franchise and be a part of potentially making a full fledged, major Valkyria Chronicles 4 happen, this game is a very easy game to recommend. It's not to say negative things about Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 though, as they're lovely games in their own right. Though they are scaled down side games in comparison considering they came out on the PSP, which is quite a bit more under powered compared to the PS3 and PCs of the modern era. Hopefully, those games come out on the PC as well. But until then, I can't recommend Valkyria Chronicles 1 more. It's definitively one of the most lovely games on the PS3 era and I can't be happier it's on the PC for more people to experience it."
"Very well done port of one of the PS3's best games. Thank you, Sega. Fingers crossed that this game is well received by PC gamers, encouraging more quality PC ports and inspiring more confidence in western releases of traditionally Japanese franchises (hint hint, Yakuza 5 and Valkyria Chronicles 3).  Looks great running at higher resolution and framerate. The pre-rendered cutscenes are still at their original resolution, but they look mostly fine - thanks in large part to the excellent art style.  Great keyboard and controller support. Fully remappable with proper button prompts for keyboard/360 controller.  The gameplay, characters, and story are still just as great as they were when this game was released back in 2008, but they're not perfect and won't be everyone's cup of tea. The characters and plot are very anime. VERY anime. The fusion of turn-based strategy gameplay with real-time shooter elements is novel and pretty darn fun, but it can be a bit finicky in spots. The real-time controls at times don't feel precise enough and there can be a trial-and-error feel to some missions. The issues can lead to the game occasionally not feeling fair or balanced, but I don't find it severe or frequent enough to be detrimental to the overall experience.  Music and dialogue are great (English and Japanese audio tracks both included). There are some minor audio issues - odd mixing, some slight popping on cutscene dialogue. The first patch has mostly corrected this issue, but hopefully it will get a little more attention because it's still not quite perfect."
"Started as a teenaged baker girl, got invaded by Russians. Slowly built up a squad of similarly aged girls and boys. Now I run a squad composed almost entirely of children who are fighting to take their homeland back. Joseph Kony doesn't have ♥♥♥♥ on me.  12/10."
"Must play if you like tactical games. I don't like that Japanese Anime Manga stuff but I enjoyed this game. If you are one of this dudes who has like a samurai sword under your bed and think asians girls won't hate you you should definately buy this game. Plot is pretty much WWII shananigans. You are like belgium or something. You fight some Nazi Inspired Monarchists but they come from the East like the commies.   Things I like: + Great looking art style. Very unique. + Great voice acting. + Music is well done too. + Works well on Intel HD 3000 (don't hate I'm buying PC soon) + Works well with controller. I used Xbox 360 and then Steam controller.  Neutral: * It gets corny. Some of the romantic sub plot has a 'written by a 13 year old virgin' kind of feel. But that's just Japanese things. If you are into that kind of stuff you will like it.  Things I don't like. - That God Damn ****king tank controls.   Tips (no spoilers): * My favorite tactic is run right next to the enemy and shoot them in a face. Well that's pretty much my only tactic. * You can save game (which i only found out in Chapter 8 or so....) * That blue turd attached to the back of the tank is vulnurable to damage. One hit with Lance will kill it. Also 20 rounds from Assault will kill a tank in turn or two depending on size of the tank. * Most of the missions are 20 turns. Take it slow.  Some Japanse words translated for you to get started: Lance = Ruchnoy Protivotankoviy Granatomet Imp = aka Imperial, Nazi Inspired Commie Monarchis guy that you kill in the game Edelweiss = Tank Darcen = Jew"
"One of my most favourite PS3 games that really never got the attention it deserved, and to be fair, I initially brushed it off when I played a demo of it with no real context or idea of the story at all. I initally bought on an impulse (I was really looking for a heavy binge of cell shaded games at the time, thanks, Tales of series!) and grew to love over the course of my playthrough. It brought everything that I loved about Fire Emblem, and more with its beautifully designed watercolour-esque presentation...all with free DLC included! Get ready for a long love letter review...  Valkyria Chronicles is set in a fictional version of Europe, known as Europa (yeah, I know, original) in the year 1935. The neutral nation, Gallia holds an abundant of an important resource known as Ragnite ore, which pretty much is this world's bread and butter for fueling just about everything. In an attempt to capture its resources, the East Europan Imperial Alliance launches a campaign on Gallia to fuel their ongoing war with the Atlantic Federation. Caught in between the crossfire, the player is left with the job to repel the foreign invaders and find peace in a wartorn continent.   Lets go by some of the differences Valkyria Chronicles compared to a normal S-RPG:  Valkyria Chronicles gameplay works off by giving each team a select amount of command points at the start of their turn, allowing each team to use it accordingly. You use one command point to command one unit for their remainder of either their stamina gauge, life, or when you are comfortable at where they've stopped. This unit is free to attack, take objectives, or escort and save allies from the battle. You later on get the ability to use these command points to perform 'orders', allowing the commander to inspire army to fight in a specific manner, which can vary from hunkering down from enemy fire or increase the chances of proccing their potentials (we'll cover this later). This goes on until one team either one team uses all of their command points or ends their turn, allowing them to pool a certain number of remaining command points for the next turn.   Now, its important to know that the actual gameplay relies on a stamina gauge movement system rather than grid based, similar to comparing a checkers where one piece can only move one square each to chess where the bishop, queen, and rook can move as far as they'd like on the board unless its obstructed. A unit can move forward, backward, sideways, etc as much as they like as long as they have enough stamina to complete that action. However you should keep in mind how MUCH stamina you have left, as you don't really want to leave a unit in enemy fire.  Each solider you recruit as you continue in the game is unique, they are all different people who have their own backstories, and as individuals, have their own personalities. This is known as 'potential', which can sometimes be a good thing, sometimes be a bad thing. Lets say for example the scout Alicia has the potential 'maternal', which, when any of her close friends are nearby she will increase her desire to protect them, giving her increased stats all around. Another one would be the sniper Marina, who is a lone wolf with the potential 'my way' , giving her increased evasive skills. But its important to note that not all are positive buffs, for example, Ramona has 'chatty cathy', which procs whenever a close friend is nearby, she just can't stop but chitchat with them, which distracts her and lowers her accuracy. Its important to know who works well with who, and what kind of quirks they have. Like having pollen allergy. Wow, that really sucks to have as a potential.  Now its important to note that just like Fire Emblem, there is PERMANENT DEATH. If one of your soldier falls in battle (barring the important story characters, of course) and are not rescued in time by an allied solider they WILL DIE FOR GOOD. There is no way to revive them if you don't reach them in time. They are gone. For realsies. In fact. there is even an in-game graveyard to remind you who has died so far in the war and how badly you failed. Talk about a punch in the gut. So its a good idea to keep in mind to train your scouts as they will most often act as your objective takers and evacuation units, just because they don't pack as much damage as shocktroopers doesn't make them useless!  I loved this game dearly as I never got so involved in a bunch of fictional soldiers than in any other game. X-COM allowed me to make silly units, but I never got attached to them, not even to Sir Buttingtonfarts the sniper. I'd recommend this game to just about anyone that has never given it a fair shot, or just love S-RPGs like Fire Emblem, Disgaea, etc, but want it in a different taste. And hey, maybe give the 2nd and 3rd game a shot! They both improve the gameplay even further by adding multiple branching classes and adding more background stories for each soldier, just...uh...they're on the PSP. Which is a bit of a dead system. And not as pretty. Oh well.  Please note that the game cinematics runs on 720p for some reason, the gameplay is working fine for any other resolution, so pick whichever you'd like. But for anyone who's playing 1080p or higher it might bother you that some of the scenes might appear a little 'edgey' or a little jagged. Yeah, its bothering me, too. But hey, 60fps! Glorious watercoloured battlefield action! In sixty framerates per second! Take that, my old launch PS3."
"Easily one of the best games of the Ps3, if not the best. a true shame the sequels were not on the Ps3. Hopefully sega will see the error of their ways &amp; bring 2 &amp; 3 to Steam.   Turn based tactical RPG with a fresh twist, for its time &amp; to this day.  Beautiful Artstyle.  Solid Story.  Good Price.  "
"Anime style story-driven tactical RPG about courageous Squad 7 of militia fighting a hostile nation that invaded beautiful and peaceful country of Galia.  PROS: - Beautiful comic book style graphics. - The game uses fictional countries and nations, but definitely has a WW2 feel. If you like WW2 themes (I do), the game is great. - Fine character development and touching story. - Good voice acting. - Good music. - Lots of tactical options. Every unit serves its purpose. Multiple options to win every battle. - Some levels are challenging, but as a person that sometimes has to refer to tutorials and FAQs, I was able to complete all by myself.  MEH: - AI moves might be better. There are times when enemy is able to ruin you, but instead of destroying one tank, delivers equal number of attacks on both your tanks. So you have a feeling that AI goes easy on you. There is no difficulty setting. - Japanese dev had to squeeze a cute winged piglet there. It serves no purpose at all. - There are times where it is sort of naive, but it's still good.  CONS: - Controls are sort of clunky, definitely prepared for gamepad, not a mouse. - Your tanks get stuck. - Some parts are unskippable, which may be painful, because sometimes you know you royally screwed up after enemy's first move and you'll need to reload from save for sure, but surprise surprise, you have to wait for enemy's all moves to do anything (it can take 2-5 minutes).  As you can see, important stuff in the game is really good. There are some nuissance bugs and glitches, but it's all within norms. I recommend Valkyria Chronicles wholeheartedly.  GAMEPLAY 8/10 GRAPHICS 9/10 AUDIO 9/10 STORY 9/10"
"After Finishing the Game, Getting over 20 Hours into Valkyria Chronicles (PC) I can finally honestly make a Review of the Game.  Port Quality: Excellent. Game does suffer from some minor bugs, but it's mostly engine related when playing at higher FPS than the game was EVER designed to perform at. Aside from that, most everything works beautifully. Graphically and even Control/Handling. Game runs absolutely beautifully for a PS3 Port over to PC. Graphically it looks beautiful as well.   Controls, In Depth: Being a PC game people expect good Mouse/Keyboard Controls. Despite being a Port this game doesn't disappoint. I played the game from start to finish using Mouse/Keyboard and save for 4 Story Missions I ended up getting A/B ranks on everything else, mostly A Ranks. Being I'm a Veteran of the game I know how to beat most missions well, and I prefer PC games vs console. I openly give SEGA a Thumbs up on their efforts on adapting the controls for PC. Even going through Menu's seems to work well, as long as users remember the menus were never designed for a mouse, so the mouse does not function for menus.   Game Itself: It is a no brainer that Valkyria Chronicles is a Masterpiece of a video game, and despite being a Port to PC it does not disappoint anywhere. Everything works well, the story and characters are colorful and memorable. The game has never been more beautiful to play because of the higher resolution options. Anyone who has any doubts about buying this game, have those doubts out of their own miss givings. There is no gamer who should not find something to enjoy in the splended world of Gallia."
"For those that have never heard of or played this game before, I absolutely recommend it. It's a good hybrid of RTS and third person shooting. Think sort of along the lines of Fire Emblem crossed with Advance Wars crossed with Command &amp; Conquer.  As for those that did play it on the PS3, I can easily recommend this version. Playing this at high resolutions and framerates is super nice. It is easy to downsample it to 4k on my 1080p monitor and I can STILL get 120FPS. The only problem I have had that is worth noting is a bug where the tank can't go up hills if you are playing on 120 FPS. Hopefully Sega issues a fix for this."
Valkyria Chronicles is a TRPG (Tactical Role Playing game) and every character under your command has their own unique personality and traits which will either give that character an advantage or disadvantage on the battlefield for that turn.  PROS - Interesting story - A great pc port - English/Japanese voice options - Game mechanics are quite solid - Graphics are beautiful though it's in ps3 quality - Sudden difficulty spikes - Characters have back stories - DLC is also very good  CONS - Speed runs encouraged for gold ratings - Some 'orders' can make missions too easy   Overall I really enjoyed the game and do hope that Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 will be released on steam in the future.
"I started the prologue.  So the Soviet Union is invading Western Europe, and wants Switzerland-Estonia's resources. And I've been arrested by a waifu.  Thanks, fish. "
"Team up with your fellow 'not Swedes' to fight the 'not Germans' and their Ubermensch, and save some 'not Jews' along the way. Band of Brothers: Anime Edition. 10/10 would erase my memory to play fresh again."

"A job well done, Great port, I can't stress it enough, this port is functional and shows that SEGA are committed to delivering quality PC products.   This is the short answer to what is to expect of this port, of a game actually a few years old, but able to outsell some big players, like certain flops released near this date.  Valkyria Chronicles is a well made strategy game, made with the intention of doing something different from usual. The intent wasn't on having awesome graphics (even in 2008 the graphics were ok) but something beautiful, and even now, six years later, the game still looks beautiful, not at all old.  The plot is engaging, maybe a bit reliant on cliches, but still well done and interesting. Any story about a war not glorifying it, but showing it with fairness (Cruelty, heroism, sacrifice, duty, loyalty...) is always a welcome sight. The main characters are well developed, and the side characters get their own missions to shine.  The music is beautiful, with some tracks being fairly normal, while others are memorable. Voice acting in English is kinda Fairly Bad, while the original Japanese work is polished and flawless.  The controls are well ported, mouse control is smooth and correct, I miss having a cursor in the menus, but the important part (The combat) goes flawless. It also allows controller use, for those who prefer the original experience.  Combat can be as challenging as you allow it to be. Certainly victory won't be an issue most of the time, but getting A rank is another, different, matter. Still, the learning curve is user friendly, as long as the player accepts B ranks for a while.  The Strategic part varies, sometimes being smart allows the player to have really fun combats, while considering possibilities. Other times using strong scouts allows to skip the entire combat by simply rushing an objective fast. It's not cheating, but still, I'd discourage players from exploiting the mechanics for fast victories.  Long story short. This game is cheap, good, it has aged well, the control is good and it's fun. Simply one of the best Tactical Strategy game i've ever played"
"An excellent, excellent port of an already excellent game. The keyboard-only controls in the book menu are a little goofy, but the actual map/battle controls are spot on and exactly what the game needed. And the game runs very well and downsamples like a monster (though, sadly, this will not help the FMV engine-rendered cutscenes).  There's quibbles but who gives a damn, the important things have been done very well and the game at the heart of the port is one of the best strategy RPGs of the previous console generation. There's no reason not to buy this and love the hell out of it."
"One of the best games of the PS3 era and you can now play it on the PC. Fun tactical gameplay, interesting cast of characters and a war story that while it has it's dark moments doesn't get too bogged down in the harsh realities of war. The anime style may not be to everyones tastes but it never gets too caught up in it's tropes. Transition to the PC from the PS3 has been fairly smooth, some slight hiccups with the mouse and keyboard controls but nothing too major (and if you have a controller set up you won't even notice). Includes all the DLC and will give you roughly 35+ hours of gameplay (not including A+ ranking all missions and replays).   It's a fantastic game for a low price, I highly recommended you pick it up now rather than waiting for a sale, so hopefully SEGA gets the message and ports VC2 and 3...and maybe even works on a 4th. C'mon 7th Squad need you!"
The girls make a cute victory pose after brutally murdering other people.  10/10
"Every bit as glorious as the original PS3 version, except now in glorious 1080p/whatever res you want, high framerates, short loading times, and chock full o' all that DLC you probably never felt like paying far out the boo-tay for.  Get this game."
Anime X-Com turned me into a jew sympathizer. Well worth your shekels.
"I don't normally play anime games, but this was awesome. The best part of the game is the fact that each individual soldier you can assign to your squad is individually voice acted, each having their owns lines of dialouge and short biography, which makes every soldier appear unique and worthwhile. Except for Engeneer Herbert. Why did you ever even join the military Herbert? You don't put any effort into anything. Do you even care? Of course you don't."
"I bought this game totally not because you can:  1) Set the audio to Japanese 2) Make a squad out of little screaming girls and a gay anti-tank dude (oh, you'll also have a winged piglet)  3) Kill everyone with your kawaii army while enjoying long cutscenes, victory poses, 'Yatta' and 'Rosie-sempai' shouts etc.  Same for you, right?"
"Steam needs more games like this, really badly"
"This is a rare specimen of a game that's more than the sum of its parts. Part SPRG and part 3rd person shooter, woven together incredibly well with amazing art and a challenging, meaty campaign - doesn't quite describe the whole of it. It's a game with character and style that crafts its own unique identity, oozes charm and has captured the hearts of many players to become the cult classic it is.  The steam version also runs insanely well compared to the PS3 original. Load and save times are nonexistent, controls are highly customizable and the game looks as good as it did in my rose-tinted memories thanks to proper support for much higher resolutions."
Im not much into anime but enjoyed VC alot. I miss good turn based tactical games like JA and X-com and VC is a good example of TBC games.
"Dear SEGA, give us Valkyria Chronicles 2 &amp; 3 please!  One of the most unique RPG game that I've ever played If you're thinking the story isn't not that good &amp; deep, oh trust me you're pretty wrong Also it's about war and war stories are never pretty  The gameplay, yes it's Turn-based but.. Kinda RTS-ish Why? Because when it's your turn, the enemies can shoot you or when it's your enemies turn, you can shoot them As long they're in sight :3  Great &amp; likable characters, like Marina or Edy(+her singing voice) But, just make sure you don't watch the anime if you liked most of them.. Because you're going to be sad for sure  The musics, what can you ask more than these lovely musics  Just one my problem Too short, I want more :P  So please SEGA release the sequels? Animu game 4 life xD    Don't nerf Alicia please, I like OP Alicia xD  "
"Game is decent port of ps3 game. I have doubts about the controls system though, but everything is customizable. From looking at the key mapping menu it didn't even look like the mouse was used until I tried playing without the gamepad. It's definitely a game better played on a gamepad if you're not quick on the keys. Gameplay graphics are great if not better. Story is unchanged fromt he orginal but if you've yet to play the DLC definitely pick this up.   I'll be occassionally streaming this since I plan on getting all the achievements eventually. Come stop by if you want to take a look at the game. Even if I'm not online there should be clips available of past broadcast.    http://www.twitch.tv/kickzngigglez   EDIT: So I've been asked a few things on stream so I'll just answer them here incase anyone else was wondering about them.  The difficulty of the game is very interesting because it's a challenging game but it can also be easy. During the early level your equipment will be rather pathetic, especially in the accuracy department. However the missions are less punishing. Later in the game your characters abilities are amazing but the game definitely punishes you at every wrong move. Unfortunately like Fire Emblem and X-COM RNG tends to make things chaotic every now and then. However every stage has an easy/short path but it usually takes a few failures every now and then to figure it out. Have fun if that's the sort of game you're into.  The story and what to expect is pretty much a standard war story. However I mean the war stories you hear from your grandparents and not the ones from hollywood. If you find experiencing a rollarcoaster of love and tragedy amusing, have fun on the feels train."
'Like Fire Emblem with guns. 11/10'
Alicia Rush Chronicles.
"Perfect PC-Port of a perfect game. A must-buy for fans of Valcyria, SRPGs, Anime and great stories."
"Valkyria Chronicle was one of those big surprise games for me on the PS3.   As a bit of an anime fan I was immediately drawn to the graphics of this game when it was first announced in Japan. When the first english release came out I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I knew I wanted it...   Valkyria Chronicles can be best summed up in the opening lines of the game itself, 'what follows is a chronicle of those fought, lived and died.' Valkyria Chronicles is a character driven strategy game combining turn based elements with third person action.   Every soldier under your command is different, they each have their own capabilities whether that be accuracy or health and all have 'Potentials'. Potentials can range from something as simple as preferring to run over concrete or urban paths leading to a rise in defence to screaming 'VEG-TA-BLES!' when they run over dirt...   Then their are your inter-unit relations. Most soldiers have three other soldiers with whom they like and if within close proximity during an attack, will lend their fire to the attack for extra damage. Then some soldiers just don't like certain individuals to one sniper hating EVERYONE.   The story is great and you'll find yourself saying 'just one more battle!' just to see the next cinematic and seeing how the story evolves and what happens to your favourite characters.   Overall give Valkyria Chronicles a go, you may be pleasantly surprised."
"Just finished the Prologue and have to say its better than I thought. The games story is rich and the combat is fun. It’s not as complex or realistic as other war games, but as a strategy RPG I still enjoyed it and can’t wait to see where the story goes and what new units I can use. Very cool"
"Amazing story that got me hooked for 10 hours straight after my purchase, the port quality is great, superb voice acting from both Japanese and English VA's.. and I was really astonished by the fact that even the squad members have their own name, voice actor, lines, appearance and personality making them all very unique, this alone really shows how much work was put into this game.  The art direction is also something worth mentioning, the use of cell-shaded and pencil sketch graphics on these kinds of games just feels so right, it's easy on the eyes and helps the player immerse himself into the game, I absolutely love it!  Gameplay-wise, I think SEGA did a fantastic job with this release as stated above, despite being a console port, the controls don't feel as awkward as one would expect, and there is also native controller support included within the game, the menus are easy to navigate and the unit movement is very smooth.  ...What a title. I'm glad SEGA decided to port this to PC, I had been seeking to try this gem out on my PS3 for a long time but unfortunately I never caught it available on retail. I can't believe I almost missed out on playing this.  10 out of 10, Do recommend it to everybody."
Tactical turn based RTS/FPS style combat You'll laugh You'll cry  You'll miss shots with 100% accuracy You'll hit shots with 0% accuracy You'll recruit barn yard animals You'll mediate fights between your allies You'll realize how frail humanity is HOW MANY CANNONS?? IS THAT TANK THE SIZE OF A LARGE OFFICE??? PEW PEW LASER BEAMS If you like Fire emblem If you like Final Fantasy Tactics If you like X-COM can you just buy this ♥♥♥♥ god damn peace 
-Nice storyline -Good game mechanics -Every soldier has a unique personality which can affect combat -Great Game Port  10/10 would play again  Hope they would release VC 2 and VC 3 on steam    
"Having never played the original Valkyria Chronicles I never had very high expectations for the game. After 30+ hours of playing and finally beating the game I can say that this game has soared above and beyond what I wanted to get out of this experience. The story is told amazingly and the passion put into it made me laugh and cry along with the characters. As I said having not played the original game I can't say how good of a port it is from the PS3 but I would definitly recommend this for someone new to the series. Solid controls and the limited mobility by the use of CP (command points) allow you to take full advantage of many actions. The ability to have a 'reaction fire' is also a new mechanic that I have never seen before but is implemented amazingly into the game, finally being able to fire upon enemies who come into the line of sight prevents many moves that could flat out ruin the game experience for me. Many different unit types and enemies also make this game interesting as each new level brings new enemies and challenges. One of the few games I could give a solid 10/10 to. Now time for the second playthrough!"
"Ok I don't want to fanboy over this game but be warned this is going to be very bias  Ok now lets put it bluntly, I love this game, when I first played this game back on the PS3 I fell in love with it instantly, how it looks, the characters, the music, the gameplay I loved ALL of it so without spoiling too much about the game I'll explain the plot.  The year is 1935 in a ficitional land called Europa, and yes it is essentially just Europe and basically, their WW2 happens with the Empire (Who are basically the Axis) and the Federation (who are basically the Allies) trying to out kill each other, during this though the Empire decides to attack a small neutral country called Galia and this is where you start the game.  You play Welking Gunther, the son of a EW1 (their WW1) Hero coming home to help your sister and maid evacuate, on the way Welkin gets arrested by the town watch due to being a suspected spy where he meets one of the other main characters, Alicia Melciott, shortly after your attacked by an empire scouting party and the game begins  now from that description your probitly thinking a very 'Tales of' game but in actuallity the game has alot of things similer to the XCOM line of games, the game is a mixture of real time and turn based gameplay, to put it simple your turn starts with you on a birds eye view with icons repsenting your troops, you select one and assume direct control of said character, here the game unfreezes and you can be shot at, you then move around, crouch behind sandbags and more but you have a bar which dictates how far you move, outside of that you can end or turn or enter aim mode.  here all gameplay stops again, the enemies shooting at you finish (though the mounted guns tend to misbehave and keep fireing for much longer) and you can do a more aggresive action, haling, repearing or the more obvious one, shooting the opponent, but be carful because if your in range of the enemy and they survive your attack they're allowed to counter attack, then you can only end your turn, when you run out of command points you end your turn and then the enemy's begin, basically being able to do the same thing.  Theres also permadeath in this game, baring a few missions every mission has one possible failure state: Welkin Dies. if his tank explodes or on the few missions he's on foot he hits 0 health you instantly fail, outside of Welkin there are 4 more 'Essential' characters, these will never die in battle and will instead retreat, being unable to be used for the remainder of the battle, then theres everybody else, if they are killed then they stay dead, no 'Amazingly they survived' or retirering due to injurys, when they die they are perminatly dead till you play through the game again.  next is the story, as you would expect for most japanesise games (Not all, just most) the game has some very cliche anime-like moments and archtypes (Including an obligatory beach scene) but actually keeps itself very down to earth and showcases something in war that most war games don't manage, how in war a situation can go from silly and fun to dark and depressing in the blink of an eye, this allows the characters to feel like actual people, you feel then reacting to the sudden changes as you would and that in turn helps you to attach to them.  Now incase i go over the character limit i'm just going to randomly throw the 3 problems I have with the game so  1. The difficulty is all over the place, some missions are rather difficulty then suddenly you get an easy one, theres one mission that is absurdly difficult about 1/3rd of the way through the game but the next 4 or 5 are a cake walk, theres no real curve which makes the experiance a litting jaring  2. the AI sometimes goes into full derp mode, I've had snipers run point blank range into my shocktroopers to try and snipe one, I've even had AIs just end their turn standing in the middle of the battlefield because they got shot once  3. the ports animated cutscenes are at 30fps 720p but the game can be played at 4k and 60fps, small gripe but a little jaring, the game looks beutiful anyway  ok still not at the character limit? good I'll continue  one thing that strikes me about the game (outside of its graphics which look beutiful especially in the animated cutscenes) is the music, which was composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto who you may know from his work in FF12 and the Tactics series, the music uses alot of violins and piano work to help express the emotion being felt at the time including tension, joy and sadness, of course this runs into the problem though that alot of tracks are repeated but thankfully it doesn't get too annoying to listen to after multiple playthroughs and it tends to save the best tracks for when its needed  now to finish off is graphics, and i'm just going to say this now, SEGA needs to use this game engine more, while it does defently have rather low texture quality its only noticeable at really close range, the Canvis engine has that really great combination of vibrant colours, strong lighting (when it's used which unfortunatly is not often) and makes the characters have very distinquishable sillouetes which prevent you from being killed cheaply, there ARE a few issues with the physics but the game doesn't use then in say how a Call of duty game uses it, typically its saved for the ragdolls which disappear after a short while  Overall Valkyria chronicles is as good now as it is then, it is well made and is one of the best games of its generation and mayhaps even be with in a few 'best games of all time' list. I would defently recommend buying this game."
"I've bought this game 1 year ago and managed to play it only couple weeks ago. Well, i regret not playing it right after purchase.  Amazing story and characters with beautiful soundtrack. I really loved customization system. It's not very complicated, so you wont be confused about weapon choice, etc. Turn-based system makes this game much more interesting and sometimes you really need to think about your next move. Also - scouts are OP! Wish there were more story and info about Squad 7 members. Not just book info.  Rosie and Marina one love &lt;3  "
"This was one of the best games on the PS3 for me, and while I've only given it a quick look on Steam, it seems like a good port. The mouse only works when selecting units in game and for controlling units after you select them (i.e. not during the menu interface), and settings can only be adjusted outside of the game, but that's a lot more port effort than some console ports I've seen. Haven't tried to see if it has gamepad support, but I'll probably play it keyboard and mouse just for the mouse aiming.  As for the game, I highly recommend it to anyone who likes tactical RPGs but is willing to try something a little different. The art is beautiful, the characters charming, the story is great and the gameplay is fun. Your mileage may vary on the between mission stuff. I liked it, but the upgrade system takes a while to get interesting, and I'm sure some people won't have the patience for selecting the next 'episode' of the story."
"I attempted to play this game on the PS3 not long after it first came out in English, but became annoyed with the game system after about five missions and stopped. Since a friend bought me the new PC port as a gift, I felt obliged to play it, but regrettably all of the original complaints I had about the game were vindicated and the port introduced a host of new ones as well.  Presentation: Valkyria Chronicles' greatest strengths are its beautiful watercolor-style graphics, which still look great six years later, and its powerful orchestral score. I have nothing to complain about in regards to those.  The PC port, while it can run at a higher resolution than the original PS3 version, has some major issues related to the graphics framerate. The game is unplayable above a certain FPS due to severe bugs with the speed of interception fire and with tank physics, and the FPS limiter only allows running the game at 30FPS or 'refresh rate' (too high on many monitors to avoid bugs.) 60FPS fans will have to prepare themselves for a 'cinematic' experience.  Many of the cutscenes are prerendered as 720p video and look very ugly at higher resolutions. They also make the size of the game's download, at 20 gigabytes, far larger than any 6-year-old game ought to be.  Gameplay: First of all, Valkyria Chronicles isn't a strategy game; it's a puzzle game. The puzzle is figuring out what the game thinks is an A-rank strategy, a feat of military genius on par with the legendary conquests of Napoleon and Caesar. The answer ranges from 'run one scout past enemy lines to kill the two soldiers sitting in their main base and 'capture' it, inexplicably forcing an enemy retreat' to 'have the same shocktrooper shoot everything' to 'move your tank to an empty corner of the map so it can attack the enemy reinforcements from behind when they magically appear.' It is never 'have your entire squad work together' or 'secure the area before advancing forward.' Foolishly attempting to use 'intelligent' tactics learned in inferior strategy games such as StarCraft or XCOM will result in punishment. You will earn less XP and money and receive no royal accolades (with their accompanying special weapons) unless you replay the missions again and again to find out what insane act of bravado can clear them as fast as humanly possible. Or you could use a walkthrough.  This isn't just because the rank &amp; reward system favors sheer speed over all else; it's because the game design itself encourages and rewards a 'lone commando' style of play. As the Command Point system makes every squaddie cost a point to move, it's far more efficient to spam CPs on whoever you already have at the front lines than to bring up an ally to assist them. Even when the diminishing returns start to make spending further CPs on your point man a waste, those you leave unused will roll over to the next phase, and the poor enemy AI means letting them have a turn will rarely hurt if your units are in safe positions. 'Orders' are another way to spend CP that's more efficient than wasting it on teamwork, the most useful one magically turning your scouts with light rifles into beasts capable of single-handedly destroying heavy tanks, and thus negating the need to use speciality anti-tank soldiers or your own tanks for such purposes.  The PC port adds quite a few bugs that do nothing to improve the experience. The most severe problem I suffered was a glitch that caused my troops to fall out of the map (  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=343008703  ) when they climbed any ladders in one mission, making it impossible to take out some deadly cannons you were expected to neutralize, and necessitating a cheesy and tedious maneuver to reach the objective despite that.  Controls: The controls are mostly alright except for the tanks. They wiggle back and forth constantly whether controlled with mouse or keyboard, wasting AP, and will frequently get stuck on something invisible and vibrate in place until they can no longer move. During missions where I had to use the tanks a lot, I had to save before moving them and sometimes reload upward of five times before I could avoid glitching out during the movement. I shouldn't need a gamepad to play a PC game, assuming the tanks control any better using one of those.  The menu system is also cumbersome and makes it a chore to do anything, gamepad or not. SEGA could have done much better in the port department here, though I suppose it's impressive by the standards of Japanese publishers that the controls and interface are mostly usable.  Story: No comment. It's pretty much standard JRPG material aside from the twist of having a fantasy-WW2 setting. I can see where people who love it are coming from, and where those who hate it are coming from. For me, it was enough to keep me playing to the end despite my dislike of the gameplay, which seems a rather commendable accomplishment.  I did notice something rather conspicuous when playing with Japanese audio and English subtitles. I'm pretty fluent in Japanese myself, but the subtitle translations (apparently an exact copy of the English voice actors' script) of Valkyria Chronicles are so loose that at times I wondered whether the person who wrote the English script was. Very few lines have the same nuance as the originals, some conversations are completely rewritten and there are even a few lines added in where the Japanese audio has only silence. The original dialogue is kind of dry and dull at times, so I can't fault the localization team too much for wanting to 'punch it up,' but I think it's a disservice to those who only know English and are unaware of the changes; I've seen quite a few people complaining about the corny dialogue in VC and wonder if they would have felt the same had it been more accurately translated.  One of many examples I could give, from the cutscene at the end of chapter 12 -  なんだか不思議、ウェルキンと話していると、いつも元気が出てくるんだよね。 僕も、アリシアと一緒だから頑張れるんだよ。 うん。　ありがとう、ウェルキン。　私… ウェルキンと出会えて…　本当によかった。  My own literal translation: 'It's kind of mysterious. When I talk with you, Welkin, it always makes me feel better.' 'And it's because I'm together with you that I'm able to keep trying, Alicia.' 'Yeah. Thank you, Welkin. I...' 'It really is wonderful that I was able to meet you, Welkin.'  And the in-game subtitles:  'You know, it's funny. Whenever I talk to you, I feel like everything is going to be fine.' 'Yeah, well, you're the only reason I haven't completely lost it Alicia.' 'Really? Thank you, Welkin. Me too.' 'I'm glad we were able to meet... and work together.'  Nitpicking? Maybe. But pretty irritating if you can tell, and worth pointing out to those who can't, I think.  Conclusion: As long as you know what to expect from it, Valkyria Chronicles isn't a terrible game, but it's misrepresented by almost everyone and will only annoy and frustrate hardcore strategy game fans (like me.) I cannot personally recommend it, but it's evident that a lot of people would, and I'm glad they were able to find it enjoyable. I encourage them to try real strategy games sometime and learn the joy of thinking on one's feet and adapting to the unexpected that is nonexistent in Valkyria Chronicles.  Additionally, due to the buggy PC port, it's best played on PS3 and not PC. I hope that patches for the PC version are coming, but I don't expect them."
"Almost perfect port, dual audio, sublime JRPG / tactics, challenging and interesting gameplay, cheap price.What more do you want?!"
"Valkyria Chronicles, originally a 2008 PS3 exclusive title, is a fantastic JRPG with a great art style, heartwarming story, and a unique gameplay experience. Without spoiling anything, the game's story takes place in a fictional land based WWII-era Europe with elements of fantasy and Japanese anime. Prejudices, war, death, revenge, family, and romance are themes that VC explores well.  The art style of the game is one of its strongest features. VC looks like a water color painting in motion and makes for a great style without seeming too bland. The gameplay is a mix of turn-based and real time strategy combat which can be challenging, but quite rewarding.  VC does have its flaws. Since it is a PS3 port, the controls feel much more comfortable on a gamepad rather than a mouse and keyboard. The difficulty of the game is moderate, but it can fluctuate at times and there is a learning curve.  Overall, Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing title that is worth playing over and over again."
"I absolutely adore this game. Its a ps3 classic that slipped under the radar for most people for its simple visual style and animeish look. While it does contain its fair share of anime tropes it still manages to be an extremely engageing experience.   The story manages to both be compelling, dramatic and silly with the game possibly being the first to really take a look at consentraition camps and blatant racism. Though its messege just seems to be that its bad. Nonetheless the narrative does keep on being compelling during the entire experience.   The gameplay can best be described as x-com meets 3rd person shooters. It manages a almost perfect difficulty curve by giving new exiting challenges on almost all the levels. It really manages to make you think about what strategies you want to use in order to win in the fastes amount possible.  Visually the game is stunning, using the best cellshade and shadow effects ive ever seen. That being said texture quality is something that looks like an early ps3 game, since it is. However i feel like they should have taken advantage of the pc horsepower giving a few more effect and higher visual fidelity.  At least the game runs smoothly without taxing my system above 10% (both cpu and gpu).  In conclusion valkyria chronicles is a must buy for anyone who likes their x-com or similar strategy games or if you are a fan of anime. The mix of the two whilst weird works suprisingly well. A lack of visiual upgrade and cringeworthy english voiceacting being the biggest downfalls of the game. However it is still an abosolute classic! 9.5/10"
"A more light hearted tactical turnbased strategy game. Not as punishing as some others in the genre. It's a decent port of a great PS3 game! Have fun!  Light hearted style and game play, not story. just to clarify."
"This is one of the notable JRPGs of last generation of games. I recently played the PS3 game(I was at the Marmota part) before buying this port and a brand new PC rig, in which I had to trade my PS3 copy for Star Ocean 4. I'm thinking that this game surpasses it's original game, just because 60fps at 4k resolution, Game comes with the DLCs at a lower price compared to the PS3 game and it fast to no loading times at all. If you are a fan of SRPGs such as Final Fantasy Tactics(They even got the composer of FFT in this game), this is definitely recommended to you. Replayability is also good since there is Hard mode and EX Hard mode.  I am very pleased to see JRPGs come to Steam and hopefully let this be known to Japanese developers that there is a GROWING DEMAND for japan developed-games in Steam, old or new games, there will be a people buying those games. GOOD JOB SEGA, BAYONETTA SERIES AND HD VALKYRIA CHRONICLES 2/3 ON STEAM PLEASE"
"Amazing story, Nice graphics, Great gameplay, Lovely characters, Good voice actors, Selvaria, My trusty GSR-30R,  Alicia Melchiott / 10"
This game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. Great port. Buy it to support good ports and good games unlike AC Unigarbage.

Music: The orchestral score for this could win it many awards, an amazing complement to the experience.  As for the VO, the characters all feel really well fleshed out and relateable, as well as interesting. even the minor squad mates all feel like they have personality. The voice actors do a superb job in their roles and the dialogue is great, nothing feels lost in translation.  15/10. Do yourself a favor. play this game. Its perfection is rivaled by very few."
"A great port and a must play. Only downside is that the cutscenes aren't rendered in game, so they look like the non-anti aliased and low resolution PS3 version."
"Think XCom meets Anime World War II.  This game has great characters, great story, great strategic gameplay, great artstyle, and one heartwarming ending. Highly recommended."
"Valkyria Chronicles is something I would definitely recommend even at full price especially for a tactical, turn-based RPG fan.   Pros:"
"I played this game to death on Playstation, that fact that its now on Steam makes this pretty much a revival of a much loved person favourite of mine. I'm sure many others are glad to see this return of this absoute treasure of a game as it is a must own for anyone who loves stratergy with story"

"Duration: 40 hours (main game without extras)  Playing Valkyria Chronicles is like watching a Studio Ghibli TV series where in each episode there is a tactical battle that is played in FPS turn-based mode. Without doing a full review the story was top notch and one of the best I've ever experienced in a video game. The art style and animations were top quality and the voice acting was also pretty good. Much of the game will be spent watching these cut scenes which explains the massive 26GB harddrive space needed.   The tactical combat was fun and a wide variety of missions is thrown at the player. The game starts off easy showing you the ropes before you put your team together Jagged Alliance style. The characters have a wide variety of personalities and the game is not without humour.   For the actual combat you have a number of command points to move your characters and issue orders. Once selected it turns into a First Person Perspective for movement. Characters have a finite number of action points to spend moving and get one attack per activation anytime during their move. The blend of FPS and turn-based tactical is unique and flows very well. Defensive fire keeps the tension up.   In between battles there is the headquarters where you can assign experience to your classes, buy R&amp;D, equip found weapons, and a number of other strategic tasks. There are also skirmish battles you can reply if you find your experience of money lacking.   A few negatives keep this from becoming a 10. First are the tank controls. Moving the tank in FPS mode almost works but takes a while to get used to. I spent a couple activations early on spastic-ing in place while trying to inch forward. Sometimes the controls are hard to move forward just a little to repair sandbags or disarm mines.   Another negative is the mid-game battle versus the giant tank which was almost depressing. Aside from that though, the battles were great. It was almost information overload once the headquarters is introduced, although it doesn't take long to understand and get into it.   All in all, the graphics, art style, story, squad-building tactical fun is like nothing I've ever played before. After 40 hours I was sad to see the story end although it did so with Ghibli delight. Overall I have no difficulty recommending this game. 9/10."
"Valkyria Chronicles... This game was one of my favourite games back when it came out, i spent hours upon hours playing through it until my console and subsequently CD died on me. And now it comes to steam.  This is VC(short) properly ported to modern PC, and from playing it since i got it till writing this, no bugs, no errors or the sorts has happened. The gfx isnt as impressive as it was back when it first came out, but for such a old title it holds up well, with the cutscenes being sketched, text with vrrrrrrr coming from the tanks as they drive.  There isnt too much to say about this beyond that its a good port off the console version, there is no mousecontrol in the menus, but its not much of a hassle seeing as you use mostly tab+spacebar+wasd/arrowkeys to navigate the menus and its fairly easy to get used to.   Plain and simple; good port of a great game"
"There are some minor problems such as mouse not working on menus, but you will get used to using the keyboard to navigate the menus. The controls works in combat, which is where it matters. The soundtrack is great, the combat is fantastic, there is so much development and uniqueness on every character (you have dozens of soldiers to deploy, and every one is voice acted, has a background story, an unique personality, etc.) This is the best tactical RPG I ever played."
"Valkyria Chronicles makes a great first impression. It looks gorgeous, has a stack of content and seems to have an interesting tale to tell. Unfortunately, the illusion crumbles over time, resulting in a thorougly disappointing experience.  It is not a strategy game. It is a glorified puzzle game, and not a very good one at that. It's riddled with exploits, unbalanced mechanics and awful AI - the sort which will send infantry running head-first at your tank. There are some interesting ideas there, but it's just so poorly executed. The main strategy involved seems to be replaying missions over and over again to learn enemy positions and understand the often obtuse gimmicks and quirks - a railing which somehow absorbs all shots in chapter 10, for instance. It's a grind, and not an enjoyable or rewarding one.   If the story was great it might be worthwhile, but despite some early promise it quickly descends into trite dialogue and grating anime tropes. The attempt at a serious story is undermined by the juvenile battlefield quips and the dissonant nature of the objectives - throw your people into risky situations to win as fast as possible. It's hard to get caught up in a dark tale of the horrors of war when you have soldiers who squeal 'Yay! Happy grass!' at the sight of a meadow.  After forming such a positive first impression, I found this game profoundly disappointing."
Fire Emblem : Awakening + X-Com + World War 2 = Valkyria Chronicles  + Excellent port + Free DLC maps add hours of gameplay + Pleasing length (she said) + Plethora of upgrades / units to choose from + Better story than expected; heavy moments + Great tactical gameplay + 'Cartoon' graphics work well  - Ticks more than a few clichés - Not ending turn quickly can be unforgiving  9/10
My Experience with Valkyria Chronicles in a nutshell:  'Why can't my snipers hit anything?'  'How can my tank miss at that range?'  'How can my Lancers miss at that range?'  'Why can't my units hit anything for ****?'  'Why did she have to die?'  'Why does my tank spaz out when I use my mouse?'  'Why does this unit have so many drawbacks?'  'Why does this unit have literally no drawbacks?'  'Why am I still playing this game?'  Conclusion: I'm a masochist.   
"It's hard for me to put into words how much I love this game.   I love the graphic style. I love the episodic storytelling. I love the characters and their growth. I love the comedy &amp; the drama.  And most of all, I love the gameplay.  This is one of the best turn-based games ever made, period.   The story is a bit cliché but you can still enjoy it. For some the anime-style presentation can be a downside, but for them I can finally say GET OVER IT! If you can't play a game for that, then you're missing on one of the best tactical games ever made.   Not to mention it's CHEAP. II can't think of a better deal.  Yeah, it's cliché. Yes, it's anime. So what? I really don't have anything bad to say about this masterpiece. Just buy it, you won't regret it."
"Heyyo, VERY BIG RECOMMENDATION!!! This game has a fantastic art style, pays respects to civilians and soldiers who lost their lives in WWII and just shines in quality. WOW, SEGA! You've impressed me so much with this game! This is the SEGA I remembered as a KID! :)  Square Enix should take some lessons from SEGA and Nihon Falcom (The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky) on how to port a console game to PC. This game runs FLAWLESSLY! There's no graphical settings, but the game engine seems to scale the texture, shadow and particle effects quality settings in respect to your game resolution which works quite well! I can run this game at 4K downsampled to 1080P and everything runs at 60fps!!! AWESOME!  Now, I do want to give you folks a serious bit of advice... THERE'S NO AUTOSAVE! So save your game after each mission.. because this game isn't 100% stable when it comes to alt-tabbing.. I've had it crash on me twice... and had to redo some missions which was annoying because I was too stupid to manually save after doing each mission haha... so you've been warned. :P  This game just RUNS so smooth! I can't get over that hahaha... there are only a few minor performance problems... two in fact. First? The title screen is locked at 30fps so it feels sluggish compared to any other part of the game, including the book mode menus which run at 60fps.... second? The cutscenes have no upscaling filters and are not 1080P quality.. they used I'm guessing the PS3 versions which are 720P which don't look as good as the rest of the game... but that's just two minor nit-picks that barely detract from this game.  Now? Let's talk about the game... Valkyria Chronicles is based off of WWII in the country of Gallum... which I'm guessing is the Netherlands if you look at the game's map of Europa. Gallum is a neutral country that was forced into EWWII (Europa World War II) by the invading forces of East European Imperial Alliance (aka The Empire) for the precious resource of Ragnite (the game's equivalent of the real world's oil / fuel... or if you love Command &amp; Conquer? Tiberium! w00t! loved old school CNC). The game follows a handful of protagonists and their allies, plus a few of what the game calls 'optional custscenes' of antagonists... now, I must say.. optional cutscenes? I'll watch them anyways. I love a damn good storyline... but I know some people aren't as patient as me lol, so they'll enjoy the ability to skip optional cutscenes.  The combat takes a bit to adjust to since it's very much an active-turn-based combat system... think of it as a kind of mix of Xcom (or Final Fantasy Tactics) with Syndicate (or regular Final Fantasy)... as you move your units around? Enemy troops will constantly shoot at you as you move around!! So keep an eye on your map, which direction they're pointed in and make your actions count! Once you're done shooting / healing / repairing / etc? Mash that ESC (or whatever gamepad button it is, haven't tried gamepad on this yet heh) button and END YOUR ACTION!! That? or quickly run your unit behind something to hide... because after you take an action? The enemy will start shooting you again. It takes a bit to wrap your head around when you're playing the game as I thought I was in the safe-zone.. and then bullets started flying again so I had to spring baction into action and try to end my actions before my poor unit lots all of their health due to my apathy haha... oops.  Training your troops goes by classes which is a lot more forgiving than games like Xcom where you shouted at your PC... 'NOO!!! I just spent hours traning that guy just for him to get gutted!! Now I need to replace him with a greenhorn half ways through the game!? WEAAAAAKKK!!!'.. Nope! This game? You loose a Lancer? Dammit... but at least the next Lancer still has the same training level. It still does suck to lose soldeirs though, as they can have some really darn handy 'Personal Potentials' and 'Battle Potentials'... which are kind of like the Perks from Fallout. They'll get advantages / disadvantages in combat depending on if they are near certain types of people (fellow Shocktroopers, tanks, males, dust, paved roads, etc) and have certain other soldiers they will 'Like' which allows them to perform combination actions with them if they're near each other... so if you have a little squad of three that like each other? All three can potentially shoot their weapons together if one of them attacks / counter-attacks.  Just... YEAH!!!! This combat system is so well thought out... well, everything about this game is well though out! It's a VERY VERY HIGH RECOMMENDATION! A special gem on the PS3 gets the special port to PC it deserves for a wider audience to enjoy. My hat off to thee SEGA for making this game and then giving it the care and attention it deserves for this port. :)"
"Bought this game back in the day when it came out for ps3. Told my friends about it, really under rated game.  &gt; Beautiful graphics. &gt; Good story. &gt; Very well done selection screen with the story progressment entwined to a notebook &gt; build your own Army regiment, with unique people and weapons. &gt; permadeath on your wounded units, if you don't attend to them on the field.  it's like Hogs of war meets, fullmetal alchemist, old school pokemon cards art desgin, with WW2 Elements."
"Fantastic gameplay, fantastic style, fantastic characters, fantastic port. Definitly a fantastic game."
"Imagine you have a copy of Fire Emblem. Replace the weapons with firearms. Improve the turn taking system. Improve character movement. Add more terrain features. Add unique background stories on every character.  This is a phenomenal game that I have no regrets buying at all. My only complaints are the menu and controls due it being a game ported over from the Playstation Portable (PSP) console, but once you get used to the controls, this game is absolutely delightful."
"This is one of my favourite games! Having previously owned it on console, figured i'd pick it up. It's a great strategy game with a beautiful art style! And the port has been done reasonably well. I would highly recommend picking up this game!"
"Normally, jRPGs are played for its story telling: you just keep going (through countless, sometimes stressful, enemy battles) just so you can know what happens in the end, because simply most of them are very well written. On Valkyria Chronicles’ case, however, I’d say it is the opposite: the gameplay is what the game has of appeal while its story, although not bad by any means, is pretty predictable and straight forward. It’s more of a game to have fun rather than to get a master piece of a story.  Story  It’s decent, but follows an anime-esque order of events which makes it feel a little generic: boy finds girl, both fight against an evil dude who wants to conquer the world, boy and girl realize they are in love with each other, boy, girl and a squad of around 8 more people defeat armies seventeen times larger because “friendship and love are stronger than anything else”. That’s pretty much it. You know how the game ends pretty much 3 hours in, maybe even less, depending on how used you are to this kind of story. The game, however, still has some really nice cut scenes now and then, which are pretty well done and cool.  The characters are OK, and you end up liking the main ones: they all have their own personalities and they are not (well, not most of them) bland. One thing that I thought was poorly executed, however, is that pretty much only five characters from your squad legitimately participate on the story, while the others that you choose to make part of your army just take part on the missions and that’s it. The game gave each one of them a biography, an unique personality and people they like/dislike, but they’ll never have dialogues or interactions with other characters (as in, by their biographies, Ted and Marina seem to have a hilarious relationship, but you can’t really see anything about it anywhere). I feel like making something like Fire Emblem, where you can develop relationships between characters on missions if they keep fighting together, and thus being able to see cut scenes of them interacting with each other would be something really great for this game.  Gameplay  That’s where the game shines. Around the lines of XCOM, Valkyria Chronicles is a turn-based shooting game with all the RPG elements it should have, using equips, status and aiming to decide how much damage each attack does. The missions and their objectives are very creative, and it’s really rare to have ones which you just have to “capture the enemy’s base”, or “kill all enemies”. Although the early game is fine, things really get good on late game, where you can’t just rush the enemy thinking there’s nothing to lose: some of the ending missions require the player to elaborate their own strategies to succeed (otherwise, you’re plain dead), and when they actually work, it feels really rewarding, especially when you’re aiming for a mission rank A. The leveling system on the game works in a way that you actually level up the classes, and not the characters: this way, all the characters of that specific class will be the same level, making it pretty much impossible to grind just one character to beast-levels and soloing the whole game with him, like many other jRPGs . All five classes are well designed and balanced, and you need to use all of them throughout the game. It has its flaws, however: I felt like the aiming of the characters is just way too awful, to levels that really ♥♥♥♥ you off. On late missions, where missing a shot sometimes is really not an option, seeing your character failing an almost point-blank shot by a lot is not really nice, and may lose you the whole mission. The aiming gets better as the game continues, yes, but they sometimes still miss ridiculously easy shots…just because. By the way, it’s so bad early game, that I didn’t even bother using snipers until chapter 10+ (which is way after middle game). They just couldn’t hit anything at all.  Another thing is that controlling tanks was TERRIBLE. I played the game with keyboard+mouse, and while WASD controlled the direction of the tank, so did the mouse…and, since you need the mouse to change the camera to know where you’re going , and the keyboard to actually move forward or backwards, you need to use both at the same time, and boy, does that confuse the game. The tank sometimes goes the complete opposite direction you wanted it to go, wasting a lot of precious Action Points for nothing.  Final Score: 8/10 Overall, a very nice game, with really fun and challenging missions. My biggest issue was indeed with the story, as it felt like the writers didn’t really want to risk doing something out of the box and just went on with what normally sells.  If you think Naruto has a great story, however, for you I’d give the game a 9/10, as you’d be able to enjoy it as whole much more."
"As someone who doesn't like JRPGs, I absolutely love this game. It's pretty much Xcom, but with a third person shooter mechanic and Nazis. Combat is surprisingly in-depth and can lead to some intense moments in-game.   The story itself is pretty good, being about 2 young adults commanding a platoon( I refuse to call them a squad. It has 20 people in it for god's sake) while going through the horrors of war. Despite its fantasy elements, it quite down to Earth in it's portrayal, filled with tearjerkers and heartwarming moments. I also really liked the characters, finding myself becoming really attached to them as the game progresses. My personal favorites are Jane the sadistic psychopath and Jann the token gay guy(voiced by Bender btw).  Soundtrack is also pretty good. Same with the voice acting, though there is Japanese for the weebs out there.   As for performance, I managed to run it a constant 60 fps on a cpu that has frame dips on Half Life 2. You won't need to worry about your potato running it.  Overall, pretty good game(except for Chapter 7. That chapter deserves 7 shocktroopers scorching it with their flamethrowers) and one I highly recommend for those that enjoy turn base strategy."
"Just a thoroughly enjoyable, absorbing, brilliant game that will suck you in and eat up days of your life. I genuinely had to get everything that I wanted to do in a day done before I booted this up, because I knew once I did I wouldn't be moving for 8 hours. It's very rare that I find a game that I just want to play for hour after hour, day after day, and when I'm not playing it I'm just looking forward to getting back into it. Starcraft, Rome Total war, XCom EU are on that list, and now VC joins them.  VC is 50% Visual Novel and 50% 'TBS-with-a-twist' first time through, and you should only consider it if you like BOTH types of game. (After the first run through you'll not bother with the story and jump straight into missions, but doing that first time round totally defeats the object of the game). The game is broken down into chapters, and each chapter tends to have about 5 or 6 story segments and one big fight. If you're just after combat and action, you'll be frustrated. Having said that, I don't usually play VNs, but the story in VC is so engaging and the characters so likeable you'll get totally wrapped up in the epic storyline. Alternate-Europe gets swept up into war, local people become war heroes, concentration camps are liberated, characters you get to care about fall in love or suddenly die. Magic happens. Giant, battleship-sized tanks explode.  I say TBS-with-a-twist because VC uses a mechanic I've not come across before. It IS turn-based, but the defenders can still react. As an example, if your active character runs 50 metres, hunkers down in cover and lobs a grenade at an enemy 20 metres away with his back to you, it's all good. If you start your turn and decide to run face-first into an enemy with a heavy machine gun pointed at you, he'll mow you down. I'm used to TBS games where I can simply saunter up to an enemy and stand one hex in front of him while he's miraculously frozen in time doing nothing, so VC's system is certainly more realistic. It's better than XCom's Overwatch option too, as that's just a one-free-shot deal, whereas one defender could happily mow down your entire squad on your turn if you decide to be an idiot.  You can see the artstyle from the screenshots. Some people may prefer cutting-edge, ultra-realistic 3D graphics and won't like this, but personally I absolutely loved it. If you're a fan of Japanese animation, Studio Ghibli-type artwork it's a real treat.  There are a couple of minor flaws. First up, like many people I messed up with the confusing save system. As others have commented, it's easy to think there's only one save slot because scrolling on the save screen is not at all obvious. Unlike a lot of games that track your campaign progress and keep a record of the fact that, for example, you've completed 12 out of 18 chapters, each save is COMPLETELY independent in VC, so if you mess up and save a new game where you're on the first mission over your save file where you're at the final mission, it's all permanently gone. This wouldn't be an issue if the possibility of multiple saves was more obvious, but if you're pre-warned it's no biggie. I managed this because I'd got to the final mission but was getting pooned because my squad was under-powered, so I was doing an optional side-mission, which was very long and in multiple parts, to get more xp. I had to call it quits for the night so I saved halfway through. The next day I was horrified to realise that this side-mission was now literally my only save, and when I wanted to switch back to the main campaign I had to start at the very first mission again. I hope that makes sense - in a nutshell, be aware of the possibility of multiple saves and use many of them to be safe!  Here's the interesting point though. With most games, if you play 40 or 50 hours and then by being a total tard you lose ALL your progress, you'd usually (1) scream yourself hoarse (2) put your fist through your monitor (3) put a jihad out on the feckin developers and (4) delete the game in a ragequit and swear never to play it, or anything by the developer, ever again. In my case, after only a minute of kicking myself, I realised that this meant I would have to start the campaign all over again, AND THIS WAS A GOOD THING BECAUSE THIS TIME I COULD DO IT BETTER! Remember I said I was getting pooned in the final fight because my squad was under-powered? The xp you get to upgrade your units is based on how well you complete each mission. Since I was scraping crappy wins with a C or D rating most of the time, and not doing side-missions, my xp had been limited and my squad were all about level 11 or 12. When I re-started, I was getting A or B ratings and playing all side-missions, so when I got to the final fight they were around level 17 or 18 and had a much easier time.  Well, if you're still reading, you must genuinely be thinking about trying VC, in which case the advice is simple: do it, you'll love it!"

"THERE IS A F****** BEACH FILLER EPISODE!  NOT EVEN A D-DAY BEACH!! A 'we take a day off, wearing bikinis and playing volleyball' BEACH EPISODE!!!!!!! IN A WAR!!!!!!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!?"
"'YES' if you are not so serious in strategic aspects or just wanna enjoy storiez. 'NO' if you want to have serious strategy game and expect this to be anime XCOM.  The good and the worst + Interesting dramatic story. + Customizable rooster and (some) equipments. - I was expecting a good strategy game but you got war puzzle game instead. Game encourages you to rush instead of quality play.  How strategic aspects was bad: - If you attempt to play 'flawless' game (as in XCOM standard), kills all enemies while taking least damage, you thought you are cool! The game tells you, TOO BAD, C or D for you, with huge decrease in reward. - To get A, you spam scout's turn, ignore 80% of enemies in the map, rush to the flag as if scout was on steriods, your main force done nothing - just here to sightseeing, now you got A and 3 times the reward! Cool! What's the point of main force, other classes? - The reward system implies you to play this way, else you will have to grind from other skermish map. If the grade had no impact or only a little impact on reward, I would not criticize this point. - Cover/bunker system is broken, flanking enemy crouching behind his bunker does nothing, you still attack with reduced damage! - The game almost force you to deploy main characters everytime, because if you dont deploy these guys, you dont get extra CP and will be at disadvantage, resulting in lower grade.  Although I was fustrated on its gameplay but somehow enjoyed the game in overall. I was fan for both JP games and XCOM. Barely thumb up for this."
"JUST BUY THIS GAME - it's amazing under all aspects: Story rich, great Gfx, very challenging tactics, detailed squad customization. Definitely a MUST-TO-HAVE turn based JRPGs!"
"This is the overall best game SEGA has made since giving up hardware in 2001. Unfortunately, when it originally released on the PS3, it came out at the absolute worst time. It was a time where JRPG's like this were being looked down on, the PS3 itself was not doing well thanks to the high price and 360's headstart, aand SEGA themselves really didn't do much marketing for the game regardless. So it wasn't the smash hit it should have been.  Hopefully now that its on Steam, more people will discover this awesome game. And this is the best version of the game, as well."
"One of my all time favorite games for the PS3 now ported over so I can play it on my PC. If you've already beaten the game on the PS3, then I suppose you wouldn't need to buy this game again; however, for those who have yet to play this game I highly recommend it.  I recommend you play this game with a controller by the way.  Now onto the actual game review. The game is a semi-turn based strategy RPG. I say semi-turn based because enemy units can shoot at you while you move during your turn and vice versa. It's a fairly simple to learn game and infuriating at the same time due to the random trajectory of your bullets, but overall the game is incredibly fun. Highly recommended for those who enjoy strategy game with elements of action/shooting.  P.S. It has dual audio if that's important in your decision making. Just a side thought."
"If you haven't played this gem yet, just do it! If you have it on the PS3 RE-BUY I sure did! One of the best Tactical games out there! The port is perfect with no resolution restrictions, no fps restrictions, full mouse support. You can go crazy and even down-sample the game form 4K or 8K if you have a crazy setup.   It's hilarious that the game on the PC looks way ♥♥♥♥ing better then the per-rendered cut scenes in the game! Why SEGA would see how popular the franchise is and make a PS4/Xbone/PC Valkyria Chronicles 4 or something!"
The only military in the world where it`s okay to have relations with your CO.  10/10 would anime WWII again
"Six years after its original release, SEGA brings Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and it's a surprising decent port. It allows arbitrary resolutions and framerates. While there is no mouse support in menus, the actual gameplay has decent mouse control. Graphically, it scales well with better hardware and runs well, although sadly all the cutscenes are the original PS3 prerendered quality. Thankfully the artstyle helps it age more gracefully than some other games. Save and Load times are vastly improved over the console version.  As for the game itself, Valkyria Chronicles is a turn-based strategy RPG. However, when you control characters the game moves in real time, with the exception of aiming. The maps in Valkyria Chronicles are not grid based, which allows the player a greater range of freedom compared to other SRPGs. Shooting is determined by line of sight (except for grenades etc), although RNG determines if you hit or not. This system works well, although sometimes the AI leaves something to be desired.  The gameplay sets the foundation for an excellent story, a beautiful aesthetic, and a good soundtrack. I wholeheartly recommend Valkyria Chronicles."
"What happens when you combine the RPG elements of a turn-based strategy game with the action of a 3rd person shooter? A completely new genre and, hopefully, the future of tactical role-playing games. Valkyria Chronicles (as far as I know) is the first game to ever try this formula and thankfully, it was done right.  I really like this game and have tons of reasons of why you should buy it to back it up but before that let's get my main issues with the game out of the way. The ranking system doesn't take in account if you killed enemies or if you allowed any of your units to fall in battle, the ranking system ONLY takes into account how many turns you took to finish a mission which leads me to another problem, Scouts. They usually are your main units because you don't really need any other units! Why would you spend your time moving around all the other classes if you can just combine orders and scouts so they can basically do all the jobs of all the other classes? You can still achieve As without the so called 'scout runs' but still... it seems a little broken (Thankfully I was able to avoid this by only trying to use 2 scouts per mission and little to no orders which made the game more fun and challenging). *You can still use scout runs to farm money and exp in the skirmishes but that's alright  -STORY In the year 1935, a huge war (EW2) takes place in the continent of Europa. The Empire tries to take on the continent in an effort to get more Ragnite for their country (basically a mineral which is used for EVERYTHING) but the Federation fights back. In the middle of both countries is located a thrid neutral country, Gallia. When the Empire decides to attack Gallia, the story of how a small country can beat a super-power begins...  You play as Welking Gunther, the son of the hero of the EW1, as he guides Squad 7 in an attempt to push the Imperials out of Gallia. In your journey you're accompanied by fellow aspiring baker Alicia Melchiott, former bar singer Brigitte 'Rosie' Stark, veggie maniac Largo Potter, genius engineering prodigy (not to mention your sister) Isara Gunther, and a bunch of other colorful characters that make up your squad.  The characters are all unique and feel different (with some cliches here and there), the plot is enough to keep you entertained but doesn't really stand out, the game deals with theme like racism and life admist war, but what really makes all of this great is the way the story is told.  -GAMEPLAY At first, the game looks like your typical strategy game (Fire Emblem, Advanced Wars, Final Fantasy Tactics, etc...) you're showned a map where you have certain objectives and you can see the location of your units and SOME of your enemies. Once you choose which unit to use with your 'CP' or Command Points is when the real fun takes place. You are suddenly thrown into a third person perspective of the unit you chose where you're allowed to move around, crouch and take cover, attack enemy units, heal yourself or your teammates, save downed units, etc... How much you can do depends on how you spend your 'AP' or Action Points which is represented by a gauge which deplets as you move. Aside from keeping watch of your AP, you also have to watch out for enemy fire which will go for as long as you are in third person perspective. Finally each unit is different depending on which class you are (Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer, Engineer, or Sniper) and to further differ each unit from one another each character has their own Potentials which trigger based on different criteria during the battle. I know it sounds REALLY complicated but to sum it up, the game is fun, unique and not really that hard to catch on once you get used to it.  -SOUND The soundtrack is great and always manages to fit the mood. The game is has full voice-acting for each and every character and really DO give a personality to each squad member or enemy. A MAJOR + is the inclusion of both Japanese and English voice acting but as far as I know, this game has GOOD english voice acting unlike most JRPGs or Japanese games in genral.  -GRAPHICS &amp; PRESENTATION Graphics are BEAUTIFUL and look rather unique with its oil-painting, anime like look. The game's hub world (if it can be called that) is divided in a story/picture book menu which divides the game in different sections and menus which, again, is really unique and looks nice.  In conclusion, BUY THIS GAME!!! Even at the full price of $20 this game is absolutely worth it!!! The game offers 60+ in the normal campaign, not to mention this version includes all 4 previously released DLCs. It has the option for a new game + and also every mission you're given a score based on performance, so you can replay missions and aim for the A rank in all 4 difficulties if that's your thing. Basically, it's cheap, unique, fun, engaging and has tons of replayability :)  Oh and I almost forgot, this game freaking has VYSE, AIKA, and FINA from SKIES OF ARCADIA!!!!! That already makes it a must buy for everyone on Steam :O  *On a side note, I did encountered some problems: -The game ocasionally crashed (recurring examples include: after the first time you visit the Headquarters, and after the results screen in both missions of Chapter 5: The Kloden Wildwood and Report 6: What Lies Beyond Hate) I have heard this happened to many others too, hope it gets fixed. -Characters suddenly glitching out of the map. They literally fall to a bottomless pit of black screen that can only be fixed by loading a previous save file. This mostly happened after climbing up stairs. Hope it gets fixed soon too."
Can change in-game language to japanese. 10/10
"TL Won't Read: 9/10. Good story/them historical references/weapons. In-depth n' stuff. Slow but tactical gameplay. RNG trolls hard. Buy it now pls.    This game is actually surprisingly in depth. It seemed very linear with a campaign-only visual novel esque style, but without the romance. Well it turns out I couldn't have been more off.  Instead what I paid for was an extensive Semi-RPG/Strategy game with an enjoyable campaign and combat flexibility. Upgrades, passives, special abilities, weapons, etc (And some romance... god damnit). The gameplay is very smooth and easy to get into due to simple controls and mechanics. For you die-hard strategists out there, the game is easy to learn, but hard to master. It's welcoming to non-strategy players who just want to play through the story. At the same time, it can be extremely hard to plan and reach for utmost efficiency for the highest rank. The skirmish option allows you to replay levels for those extra hardcore perfect-run gamers seeking to get the spotless win (Me being one of them). You can even change the voices to Japanese if you're tired of hearing horribly awkward English voice acting!  It's hard not to like this game even if you don't particularly go for WWII based games. The story/concept is appealing for the average player. World War history buffs will drool over the historical references and weapons. My favorite of course being the Lancaar Anti-Tank-Gun-Thing that reminds me of the Panzer Faust. Albiet the gameplay can seem slow paced at time, it makes you stop and think rather than going Leroy Jenkins all over the enemy. Furthermore, each of the characters' unique personalities makes it easy to get attached to them, and hard to simply have them charge like a pawn.   There are no 'choose your lifelong partner' options or super complex MMORPG skill trees. If you're looking for something ridiculously open-world and free then move along. Additionally the RNG can get a bit frustrating. Such as having your favorite stormtrooper sniped across the map by a tank... twice. I've had one or two hair-ripping, vein-popping, desk-flipping moments where seemingly easy shots will fly right over targets. Occasionally the the tanks you control spazz out and turn in wrong directions, or your soldiers will fire their entire clip into the ground because 'F*** You' that's why. There's even some racism against the fictional race of dark-sins... darksens... darxsens... darcsens? It starts with a D or something. Oh and some characters get a power buff just by getting turned on... Just don't ask.  Regardless of the small peeves, this game is definitely worth the money and the time."
"From what I've played so far this game is not only a seriously good port, it makes me regret not buying a ps3 to play the game when it first came out. Valkyria Chronicles combines good animation with an interesting plot, driven by a psudo WW2 setting and complimented by interesting and diverse characters with personalities which crosover into the awesome xcom-like gameplay. Jump to the last 2 paragraphs for Summary.  After the first 3 chapters you are given control of a squad of 20 people which you can pick from the starting recruit roster of at least 30. Each recruit has different things that they like and dislike which act as potential modifies to that recuits ability on the field. 'Alex' might fancy women, for example, meaning when he is in close proximity to women he has the potential to have an accuracy boost as he want to impress the ladies. There are many others such as 'pollen allegies' which has the potential to distract the person when they are located near flora or on meadows leading to a reducution in accuracy. This little intricacy adds so much to the gameplay all the while surreptitious causing the player to form connections to each member of your squad as you begin to remember that 'Alex' while he fancies women is also big on camaraderie so being close to multiple members of your squad could potentially increase his effictiveness in battle.   Battles are acomplished in turn baseed manner, facilitated through the use of Command Points (CP) and Action Points (AP). Command Points are actions spent by the Commander (The player) to move troops and issue orders. Each troop can be activated through one or more CP. Once activated you are then given control of that recruit and can expend AP to move acround the battlefield. You can also choose at any time to perofrm a specific action whether it be shoot the enemy, throw a grenade at the enemy or heal yourself. This can be done withour completely expending your AP allowing you move to a position where your attack is potentially optimal and then retreat to cover to defend against attacks on the enemies turn.  In between mission you can upgrade your squad's equipment through expending points on armour and weapons while also improving the abilities of each class through spending earned experienced in the training area. The whole headquaters area reminds me once again of X-com as you have you barracks where you can look at detailed information on your men, the Research and Development tab where you can purchase equipment upgrades as they are unlocked through the story mode and the commmand tab where you can remove and add different members to your squad.   To summarise, if you like the gameplay of X-com, a low fantasy/alternative WW2 setting, and anime style animation then this is the game of your dreams. For $20 you get a game with an awesome setting backed up by solid gameplay mechanics which are easy to learn and control due to excellent Mouse &amp; Keyboard functionality.   Also the performance on my rig was excellent as well the a solid 60fps@1080p in all gameplay circumstances. I did notice some micro fram stutter in the cutscenes, however it is not enough to detract from the overall experience. Main Rig Specs: cpu: AMD fx8350 gpu: Gigabyte gtx 980 Monitor: Benq 60fps 1080p"
I guess I can sell my ps3 now
"8.5/10  genre : turn based/tactical game with rpg elements  + beautiful graphics, although i don't like anime art in games, in this game combined with the beautifully drawn environments the result is great + epic storyline, hours of cutscenes that not only explain the story but enrich the character portraits - fictional world war setting with many twists and emotional moments + unique blend of turn based and real time strategy - tons of upgrades - leveling up really matters and gives great advantage - lots of side missions and skirmishes that you should play in order to earn xp and upgrade more - very challenging battles from the beginning, nothing is random , you get rewarded for playing wisely + excellent port, controls with m/k with no issues + addictive and long game with replayability  - well no big flaws in the game, what i found more annoying was some presentation issues in the sense that i find it weird to have in my team a 12 year old girl as a scout or a 35 year old man presented as a fully experienced old soldier lol (same issue i have with jrpgs, that makes me loose immersion) - too many cutscenes but fortunately most of them are short and to the point  really great game, i could say epic since the story is epic itself, surprisingly good gameplay recommended not only to fans of tactical gameplay but all those who like a challenging game with a very rich story"
"This game is much better than I thought it would be. The Turn-Based strategy mixed with real-time 3rd person combat is pretty well done, much better than I imagined it.  The map is populated with enemy units, with your own placed prior to the mission at specific control points. You have a variety of soldiers to build your own squad with, including Snipers, Heavies, Troopers, Scouts, and Anti-Tank units. Each individual soldier have several individual traits and personalities that make them unique and suited to different environments and situations, making pre-planning worth while. Knowing your soldiers strengths, weaknesses, personality, etc., even down to who they work best with and who they don't. Mix in equipment and upgrades, not to mention a customizable tank, and this game doesn't fall short on the prep. It's simple enough for the less forward thinkers to jump in to battle, but a good strategist makes the difference (and yes, permadeath exists).  Once the battle starts, the fighting takes place in turns. You have a certain amount of command points, which you need to move your units. You spen command points to select units to move from an overhead map, then move them from a third person over-the-shoulder perspective. Each unit has a stamina bar, which determines how much you can move the unit around. When you aim, you're stuck in place Resident Evil style, allowing you to take your shot. Your unit shoots, then your opponent shoots in turns. You have a choice of weapons and tools, which vary based on what unit you've selected. You've got some support squadmates, like an Engineer, who disables mines and repair the tank, and some support tools, which includes a healing item and ammo packs. As stated above, some individuals have unique skills, which can affect the battle in a lot of ways, such as a unit with the Tank Killer trait do more damage to tanks, misandrist characters won't work well with male sqaud mates, and so much more. As the commander, you can issue orders, such as a retreat, heal, damage boost, accuracy boosts, morter support, etc. There's a lot to do and take in, but the game's difficulty curve does a good job of introducing all this stuff to you slowly and thoughoughly.   Once that's done, a story happens, and it's a great story. You can press A or Space to continue the story. There's main missions, side missions, challenges, and so much more."
Amazingly fun game and a good port. Hope SEGA will port the other two games
"Main three female protagonists wear military mini-skirts and standard army-issue panties, Marina best Sniper in the game is female, Jane best Shocktrooper with 307% dmg capability is female, Audrey best Lancer that can OHKO a Boss Tank is female, Aika best waifu is female, and most importantly I recruited Aisha, a twelve-year old girl, into my militia squad.  WWII/10 would draft an army full of women again."
"Truly amazing game in all aspects. Fantastic music, rich detailed story and characters, great graphics and interesting gameplay that can be challenging but not impossible. My favourite game of all times.   Now please release VC2 and 3 on steam thank you Sega."
I hope this game pushes more Japanese developers games on to steam since thier is a precence for anime games in the market.
To quote Yahtzee: 'Angsty teenagers defending the hundred acre wood from mean old uncle Adolf.' 10/10 GOTY
"A wonderful port to the PC that runs buttery smooth, which was my main worry. Luckily one that was misfounded! As far as strategy games go, it's a neat mix of turn based and real time systems, albiet with minor annoyances here and there. All the same, if you've been at all interested in it in the past and never had a PS3 to play the original release on, it's well worth grabbing."
"I played half of the game on my PS3 and I fell in love with it. When it came out on Steam, I bought it the very first time it went on sale (although the game is more than worth its full price) There isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said, so I'll just keep it short.  The good:    Great visuals. Everything is rendered to look like a watercolor painting. It truly blends the anime art style with 3D environment.     Engaging storyline. It is rather simple and somewhat predictable, but it's well written enough to keep you wanting to progress through the game.    Well developed characters. All main characters have a unique backstory, and they actually affect the skills of the characters (called 'Potentials' in the game)    Exceptional fun combat. It really requires you to think about the moves that you're making. Every choice you make is crucial, from which unit to deploy first, to which direction your unit should face after their turn. It's a fair system, if you fail, it's only because you did something wrong. Each battle is rather long and failing it can mean restarting all over if you didn't save or you initial setup is wrong. But it never feel like a chore to retry a battle.    Some people have complained that the pre-rendered cutscenes look outdated because they're rendered in 720p. I can barely tell the difference, and that's saying something since I play all my games at max and 60fps. I suppose the difference is unnoticeable because of the anime-like art style.     Full controller support. I actually played this using the PS3 controller and MotioninJoy DS3 tool   The bad:    Occasionally, I experienced lag. It would usually last 1 turn, and would return to normal once you go from unit view to command view. It is quite infrequent and not a major problem.   So, if you're a fan of RPG, especially JRPG, this is a must have."
"As someone who hasn't played this on a console and who pretty much impulse bought it, I was not only plesantly surprised, but very much have enjoyed playing it. A wonderful game all in all. I could only tell it was a console port thanks to its somewhat strange controls. The characters are enjoyable, developed to a good degree, the combat, while a little annoying with RNG is compensated by the ability to save during combat so if you really are driven you can taken down the target you keep missing by just continually rolling the save.   It has a light difficulty curve and shouldn't be too hard as a new game to pick up if you like a plesant mix of Turn-Based Strategy and Real Time with a healthy dose of a RPG. I would definately recommend it to anyone looking for a solid, rather novel game."
"You play as Yang Wenli's hippie twin. Instead of alcohol and history, he's obsessed with flowers and bugs."
Never forget the 6 million Darcsens.
"One of the best games for ps3 finally hit pc!  Valkyrie Chronicle is a JRPG strategy war game and one of few JRPG that is ported from japan. This game is a must buy for newer and veteran JRPG players, now lets hope SEGA stop making crappy sonic games and port over Valkyrie Chronicles 3 and 2 for PC."
"You don't know the meaning of under appreciated until you've played Valkyria Chronicles. Without a doubt, I can say this is my all time favorite strategy and PS3 game. It has a beautiful soundtrack along with amazing graphics. The game also comes with a colorful cast of characters and is very story oriented.   Now, if you don't enjoy cut scenes . . . chances are you will still love this game. Although you may find yourself sitting through cut scene after cut scene, each help develop the story and truly tell you just what type of game the creators were trying to make. I'm also a bit disappointed on the game's length, but that's probably because of this games uniqueness that isn't offered anywhere else.  I will also mention that this game does indeed have two sequels. Unfortunately, both were released on the PSP, so don't expect a PC port. Plus, only the second Valkyria Chronicle is available in English. On the bright side, there is a fan made English patch available online for those of you interested.  To sum up my lengthy review: BUY THIS GAME! BUY IT NOW! PLEASE SUPPORT THE MOST UNDER APPRECIATED GAME IN HISTORY!"
"Its not like I wanted this or anything SEGA.   Its about time, stupid idiot company. Hmph.   Seriously though it looks like a solid port in terms of technical standards, its Valkyria as you know and love it if you are a fan of the series.  If you are new to the franchise then sure take a look at this simply because its a grossly overlooked game due to its presentation. For an animated game the art style is beautiful, beyond that of any animated game I have ever played. The story is surprisingly deep as well and handles many facets of wartime life and experience.  I will say I had issues when running 16:10 with letterboxing, but using an external tool has sorted that out. Edit: Sound issues have been fixed with a patch within hours of release, what a lovely job SEGA are doing with supporting this game. Though if you are still having trouble, try switching speakers to 5.1 mode and disabling all but the ones you have, sound should work perfectly then.  Hans/10"
"Boy, what a ride this game was. Captivated from start to finish, on the edge of my seat to see what happens next. I, personally, am not really big on the anime style and was kind of hesitant when i got this game from a bundle. I gave it a chance because of it's good reviews and I don't regret it a single bit.  The gameplay was amazing. It was different, in fact I've never played anything like it. It was refreshing. It gave a good mix of strategy but also gave you some control on how you moved your units and where to shoot with them. Sure there were some parts where controlling a unit was iffy around some spots, but it wasnt gamebreaking or aggravating. In general I was surprised but content with the new approach.  Story wise I have absolutely nothing to say against it. Everything was nicely layed out. The story wasnt stretched into a boring drag and it also wasn't too short. The details to the story were well presented and everything was pretty clear. Some parts even managed to bring a tear to my eye. The 'Story Rich' tag on the game store really represents it well.  Overall I think I would give it a solid 9/10. Definitely would recommend it to friends."
"I was sold on the game Valkyria Chronicles because it was supposed to have good strategy in a turn based format, and it was supposed to be frank about the horrors of war in an alternate universe mash-up of the two World Wars. This is what I had read about in reviews, and my mouth watered with anticipation of seeing this handled with the flair of an anime.   The Story"
"Great Game! 21.6 hours in and I'm still in the thick of it, the campaign is long and the story is riveting. The PC port is outstanding, nothing feels lacking compared to the PS3 counterpart."
"One of the few remaining reasons to own a PS3 makes its way to PC.  Instead of reviewing the game itself (which is excellent and has been written about endlessly since its PS3 release in 2008), I'll instead comment on Sega's commendable port. Display options aren't quite as robust as some would hope, but the major boxes like hi-res support, rebindable keys and 60+ fps have all been ticked. Throw in achievements, trading cards and all the DLC included at no extra cost, and you've got a port that is absolutely worth supporting.  Attention Japanese devs/publishers trying to gain a foothold on Steam: THIS IS HOW IT'S DONE."
My favourite game of the PS3/Xbox 360 generation comes to steam! Definitely a strong contender for my favourite of all time.
"A Fun and Beautiful game that was originally on PlayStation 3.  Pros:  The DLC´s are including  1080p  60 FPS and..it seems locked there BUT its not 30 so whatever. Rebindable Keys! yey! Support of lots of peripherals, i notice my X55 HOTAS even works! :D  Minor Con: No visual improvement options.   Neutral: It´s Clearly a Copy paste with few improvements from the PS3 version. Keyboard and mouse works but you can´t navigate the menu with the mouse, at lest you can aim with it. You cant change the the settings ingame, you have to do it before starting the game.  I do recommend a controller for this one, but if you dont have one its Prefectly fine with KB+M just make sure you go trough the control settings before you start playing the game. If you don't like the default settings, as stated above, you can Change them thankfully!  A Clear 9/10 in my book and i only hope they will give it some tweaks down the line :)  Thanks ...whoever ported the game! Although i still have the Ps3 version its nice to se it on PC as well &lt;3  Now to Crank it to 4K and se what happens. Edit: didnt work :("
Play Valkyria Chronicles. It's a good game.
step 1: kill an enemy  step 2: disregard the life you have just taken  step 3: give a flashy victory pose  Repeat process to VICTORY FOR GAHLIA
"MY ADVICE . . . ?!  JUST BUY THIS MASTERPIECE, IT WORTH THE PRICE, AND WORTH THE TIME XD  BEST GAME EVAR!!!!  1000/10"
Was disappoint because you can't play as the Germans and everyone knows that Germany has best tanks. Instead you play as a Belgium that never signed into neutrality. With an army of little girls. Even better.
"Man, talk about a hidden gem! I had never heard of this game before I saw it on Steam for %75 percent off during a Sega sale promotion. I was browsing through what games were available and, unfortunately for Sega, reviews on most of the offerings were unfavorable. But Valkyria Chronicles stood out with overwhelmingly positive reviews, and I can say now that I've reached the end of the game that every positive review it received was well deserved.   Without giving anything away, it has a complex but not overwhelming battle system that is part turn-based strategy, part third person shooter, which remains enjoyable and challenging until the very last battle. The story is touching and keeps you guessing throughout each chapter. Simply put I've never played a game like this; with all the COD clones and sequels nowadays its really refreshing to see something so original in both gameplay and story line. The only unfortunate fact is that more people don't know about this great offering from Sega."
"Of all of the turn based RPG's I have played over the years, this has got to be one of the most enjoyable games I have touched. Immediately up there with FF7, Chrono Trigger, and Legend of Dragoon. The tactics are XCOM like in a way that totally fits, and the story is amazing to the point that I desperately hinged on every word from every character. Yes...EVERY character is voiced, and voiced EXTREMELY well. The picture chats keep the game from getting bogged down in cinematics, and the overall flow is very smooth. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone with a penchant for TBS games. And if you into story-based games. I played a very casual playthrough, going through everything I could...and JUST finished the game at something near 28 hours played. TOTALLY worth the $20 USD I spent on it.  So good I am going for a full round two, got to get top ranks on every mission in this game, its that good."
"A classic and beloved PS3 game finally makes its way to PC, and it's obvious that the developers took the time to do it right. Keyboard and mouse support, rebindable controls and graphics optimization make playing the game on PC just as fun and natural as it was on the console. So hurry up and pick up a copy so you can fight for the Empire!  I mean... Gallia. Fight for Gallia, I guess."
Just completed this game and I will have to play though New Game+ to get all the achievement.  Overall this is a very interesting and different game then most Turn based Strategy game.  Every time you issue a unit to move and fight all enemy within range of that character will interception fire and act like actual Time based which force you to act quickly and decisively.   I know this game has been out for a while but the because the unique type of pencil drawn graphics it doesn't look old at all and seems very refreshing.  The actual game difficulty is real hard. I spent quite a few hours at the very beginning to train all my troops type to level 15 and most mission still seems very hard. I usually start the mission play it get a rank B or C then load a save game then read online guide and with some Save/Load Power to finally get an A.  The music of this game is actually really good. Once you complete the game once there will be a music section for you to enjoy all the music in game. I actually had 'Play all' option on and reading a book for a while and it's quite enjoyable.  The achievements for this game is really straight forward but it does take 2 full play though to get them all.   The length of this game is quite long. Animation and story does take a long time to go though and it's pretty interesting and sad at times.   Overall 8.5/10 would be my rating.
"chapter 1: control a group of teenagers and kill 3 enemy scouts ''ok, bit wierd but its japanese so understandable''  chapter 6: fight a tank powered by three nuclear reactors and a woman who shoots lasers from a lance and cant be killed  steeplearningcurve/10"
"A good port from Sega. The control transition from console's gamepad to keyboard+mouse is seamless. How low the resource this game need is another added point.  My only irk is how limited the configuration is, but at this price point? It's a no brainer, buy and play this game."
"XCOM: Weaboo Within, 10/10 Missed the first tank and killed the gate and had to restart."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a heartwarming story about the struggle of a once nuetral nation that has been stuck between the buttcheeks of 2 huge military powers fighting over a mineral. You play as Welkin, the 22 year old son of a legendary war hero, along with his Sister (Isara) and his hot grill (Alicia). This game so far (for i've not completed it yet) is a challenging tactical war game that gets hard pretty fast. Don't let the Anime part turn you away, there are no 'Waifus' or 'Senpais' in this brilliant game.  Pros: - Strong Main Characters - Each foot soldier has their own personalities and traits - Excellent voice acting - Intense Battles - Customizable squad  Cons: - Some awkward pauses between lines - Lots of excessive actions such as emotional hand clutches and awkward eye contact (But that's just the anime coming out) - Pretty awful tank controls (Use the mouse to turn, not A or D) - The ♥♥♥♥ing engineer at home base that only calls you by 'Bro' or 'Dude'  8.8/10 Would put a fat emo kid named Kevin on my squad again"
"Valkyria Chronicles commits one major sin as a strategy game: it expects you to follow a certain order of steps in order to complete any given map. You *can* beat the maps in a variety of ways--and the game will rate you poorly for it. Setting up chokepoints with scouts, blitzing with soldiers, sabotaging enemy tanks with Lancers... you can be as smart as you want, VC won't like you unless you play how *it* wants.  If you can get past that, you'll find an amazing title here. Lead artist Raita is a little odd in how he draws women (boobs do not work that way, good sir), but there's no faulting the amazing visual style and setting for this game. For something set in as mined-out a concept as World War II, Valkyria Chronicles is far more engrossing in its visuals and music than its concept will make you think. Gameplay-wise, Valkyria Chronicles is also quite inviting in its combination of real-time third-person action and turn-based gameplay.  Many of the fun content in Valkyria Chronicles--different weapons for recruits, for example--are hidden in out-of-the-way areas and will need a guide to be found, and the odd sense that you're not playing as the game wants you to will haunt you, but Valkyria Chronicles is a game that is definitely worth your time and money."
"Gonna let y'all know first thing, I bought this on playstation back when it came out because it was cheap, I was into WW2, and I liked the boxart. This somehow became one of my favorite games of all time.  I'd played this game for years and the revival on steam was a huge deal for me being away from home so often. It's a very unique title, with a great artistic feel and a storyline I thoroughly enjoyed. They weren't afraid to push some boundaries with the story, taking a look into basically the holocaust and concentration camps.  Something about the characters, the way their stories flesh out the more you use them really impressed me. I would go back for a second playthrough and realize half of my 'Squad' had about two sentences in their biographies and would decide to make up a new 'misfit' squad of characters I've never used. The story just captivated me and I fell in love with the characters and universe of it. Replayability isn't the highest but SP-Campaigns or whatever it's called going back through the story with all the tech you've already found is a lot of fun. I love the tactical/strategic genre and while it is a PC port with some interesting controls it wasn't that hard to adjust to.   The game for the most part struck me as an artistic experience. Kinda like Shadow of The Collosus way back in the day. A gorgeous soundtrack, a unique art style, just a different kind of game. Maybe not a AAA title but to be honest I'm getting sick of those. Here's hoping this re-release is the spur needed to get the sequels here in the West! Assuming SEGA can un-screw itself with that PSP business."
"This is how you do a PC game, well done Sega, bring on more games please! Runs at a silky smooth 60fps with no drops even when i forced AA on my card at 8x. BRING ON THE GOODNESS SEGA! MORE!   Square-Enix Take notes, this is a proper PC game."
An anime where you get to play x-com between episodes.  It's good.  In it's own way.
"Excellent turn based tactical strategy game featuring a bread baking female soldier with really bouncy hair.  Unlike some other recent PC ports which shall not be named, there's no rifle animations locked to 30 fps, it actually supports resolutions, escape key doesn't spontaneously make the game explode, and performace is a constant smooth 60fps (or even higher if your display supports it) on practically any computer. The only downside right now are some minor audio issues which I hope and expect Sega will patch. Aside from that, this is an excellent PC port. And most importantly, it's a really great game so go buy it now!"
Absolutely amazing port. This game is everything I love about JRPGs while still keeping things fresh. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys this type of thing.
"I played this game twice already. From start to finish. I read the storylines again and I wasn't even bored.  I highly recommend this game to anyone. Highly isn't really the right word, YOU MUST BUY THIS GAME!  I'll tell you the only con when playing the game. No matter how well you aim, your troops will screw up for you by missing their shots even if they are bloody close. Yes, I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU SNIPERS! Snipers are only excellent when they are properly levelled. You have heard my warning."
"Beautiful game with beautiful graphics and a breath-taking story. Shame how someone had to spoil it's storyline for me so I no longer am able to enjoy the game how I initially was. The TBS aspect of the game is amazing and I fully recommend it to everyone who has the money in their pocket.  I got it when it was -75% off, but even at full price, I say it's well-worth the money. Only complaint is that it takes up 20gb, but that's just me.  Great game."
"Man!! What have I been missing!!? I really wish I'd bought this for PS3 back in 2008 when it first came out.  Being an avid follower of JRPGs over the years, I put this one to the side upon its initial release back in 2008. The reason? Well, let's just say I was turned off by the military based story driven narrative. What a fool I was! Now having played through a good portion of the game, I can happily say that this game is an absolute gem, and I should of taken heed from my friends to play it when I had the chance.  Still, here I am now, and it's a fabulous game, with a great cast of characters, interesting story arc and gameplay......OH THE GAMEPLAY, how awesome thine are. Each mission is beautifully designed, in such a way I never feel like any of the missions are copy pasta jobs. Each one has their own corresponding story event, and style. For instance, sometimes you just need to clear out the bad guys in one mission, and capture the base, another mission requires you to sneak through an enemy encampment and survive, and another tasks you with destroying a behemoth tank, but in varying stages throughout the mission. It really is a feat of how level designing should be done.  The main character and supporting cast are very engaging, and the storyline is fun and sad, but very endearing and you find yourself having empathy for a variety of the characters. Some of it is a little cliched, but not so much that it becomes overtly obviously. Just enough for it to be cohesive, but not enough for it to be cheesy, a nice balance imo.  Anyway, here is a quick overview summary of my pros and cons of the game:  Pros: - Fantastic port, with optimized controls and very easy to follow. - As far as strategic JRPGs go, this has got to be up there with Final Fantasy Tactics and Disgaea. But completely different in style, truly a tour de force of strategic role playing right here. - Colourful presentation throughout, basic, but polished well where necessary. - Superb music. Traditional JRPG styled music with a strong element of military based rythmes. - Intricate customization options from weapon/tank modifications to order commands and squad assignment. It's all up to you, great fun. - Relatively cheap game for such plentiful content. - Great characters that you actually will care about.  Cons: - Graphics are a little dated (It's a 6 year old game) - The AI can sometimes do stupid things like jump over a sandbag, run around, do nothing, then run back over the sandbag and hide. - The game crashes occasionally for me in really annoying places, like during a mission or before i've saved after a mission. So remember to save at every conceivable chance!  So there it is. At the end of this all, I could go into far more detail, but all you need to know is this equation: Do you like superb strategic JRPGs - Yes? Do you like great storyline arcs, with fascinating characters - Yes?  Then wait no longer, go and buy this excellent game!"
Destroyed an army consisting of elite soldiers with an squad of minors.  How the HELL did they raise their kids in Gallia? 10/10
Hired cute sniper lady. Watched her get brutaly exploded by a mortar shell. My troops couldn't get to her. She died. Super sad now. Good game 11/10.
"FOR GALLIA!!! loosley based in the Early Stages of WW2, Valkyria Chronicles Depicts War in the eyes of a Militiamen Platoon called 'Squad 7' during a Conflict between 2 super Powers, The Empire and the Federation, while The Country you hail from is called Gallia a 'neutral' country in the Conflict, it would soon be dragged into war for Not only its Rich Resources but other More Elaborate Plans. Valkyria Chronicles plays and Completes like a really good JRPG on the PS2, From character Progression and Weapon upgrade Progression this game follows a good Pace at which you Level and Flow along with the Story.  The game boasts---  ***Tactical Gameplay as you Lead and manage multiple Squad Mates and Veichles to meet certain Objectives.  ***a Overview map in between Teammate turns to see where and what enemies you have Spotted.  ***Free roam Turn based Combat, go where you will on the battle field using all the cover and advantages you can use, giving the player As much freedom as possible to meet any objective.  ***Characters host a multitude of abilities relating to the terrain they walk on to the people they fight along side and fight against  ***Rank System for Completing Missions and chapters , rankings are from A-D i believe (End game stuffs) Replayability!  ***Team Customization, picking who will be on your team or how many of each class you want in your party, along with minimal kit customization for more specialized weaponry for certain characters.  **MUSIC by:Hitoshi Sakimoto, look up this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, he is god like. Maybe you have heard of Final fantasy 12? TACTICS OGRE? Final fantasy Tactics,A2? or for the PS? this guy did it. such a bad ♥♥♥!!! a god amongst Video game musics *V*  **60FPS and Smooth!  ---some Negatives--- **The Camera movement sometimes can be tricky on corners.  -well placed shots that hit air instead of going in between small yet well spaced out objects (invisible Walls or rather large object hitbox) but then again this game does not have a lean left or right option but that is ok since it does not detract from it for those shots are very rare to find.  ***720p Cutscenes, looks a lot more low res than the rest of the game.  **has a ranking system that May or may not be to everyones liking, a hit or miss really. more about Blitzing than actual slow and Tactical Combat when trying to Get the BEST rank, but sometimes every combat is not about killing every enemy on the field but actually getting an objective done so i can dig it, but some people cant. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A good Story based Tactical RPG and wishing for the other episodes in the Valkyria Chornicles to come out for PC Give this game a shot If you are into JRPGS, a good story, some Refreshing Team based Tactical Game play."
"This game is amazing. Through cel-shaded visuals they somehow manage to capture the horror of war without being overly violent and gorey. Starting with a group of militiamen, which are only citizens who were called to take up arms; a good portion of them being under 18 years of age (Oscar is 15, to put it into perspective), you fight battles that the army deems (without explicitely stating it, but you start to realize it as your characters would) too dangerous or trivial to send their own troops to do themselves (normally, these 'trivial' battles involve throwing your people in front of tanks or machine guns to 'clear the way' for the actual army, something that would usually encur high casualties) because to the army General, you're expendable and nothing but peasants and farmhands and he's not far off. While the General believes himself to be Aristocratic, your group in Squad 7 is anything but. Welkin, the main character was going to school to be a teacher despite being the son of a warhero General himself. Alicia was just a baker, Oscar, who is 15 wants to protect his sick brother. You have people in your group who were in EWI (European War I), a girl who was a magazine model, outcasts, students, a singer, all just normal people which put into perspective that you're not leading a group of battle-hardened soldiers into war, but a group of everyday people who just want to protect their homes.  The game starts off lighthearted enough but quickly ramps up in ambience when Imperial troops start shooting civilians while running away. The battlezones start colorful and bright but quickly shift to bleak trench filled warzones where you start jumping into trenches and getting down and dirty using your Shocktroopers against enemy entrenched troops with flamethrowers, hand grenades and sometimes just sheer luck all the while dodging mortars flying around and machine gun/cannon emplacements you have to keep out of the line of fire of, it gives you a sense of satisfying trench warfare that even top FPS games can't match (and this is a turn-based RTS RPG game).  That is evident when the game puts your in its own version of a Normandy-like beach landing where you have to capture a beachhead from the Empire and get past machine gun bunkers on the cliffside that will tear any soldiers that enter their line of fire to pieces with no chance of getting to cover. After that, you go up the hill where tanks are waiting and foot soldiers, past them you enter trench fighting, where you then run down another killzone with machine gun bunkers to make it to their beachhead base where they have soldiers and tanks waiting for you. Well Squad 7, time to get to work. What drives it home more is throughout the game you unlock chapters focusing on specific characters to see the more human side to them, and on more than one occasion your people raise the fact that the missions they are about to undertake has a high chance to get them killed, a far cry from your 'Oh what, we have to run through a burning building, scale a mountain and survive a nuke? No problem' FPS-like super soldiers.  It's a story about war, love, betrayal, loss AND it has satisfying combat and appropriate challenge? 10/10, would recommend to anyone."
"This was one of my favorite games on PS3. I bought this game again for PC and I'm so glad I did. This game has a very decent story, great characters and powerful moments that will make a grown hairy man cry. A very unique Turn-Based game which is a must for every fan of the genre with a bit of RPG elements. I really don't care about Steam achievements but I admit it's a nice addition since it adds a bit of value and replayability (the PS3 version had no trophies).   This is a solid 10/10 game and an underrated classic. Great PC port, affordable price. Get it now!"
-Bought Game -Watched long cutscenes -Murdered Communazis.  11/10 would play again
"You stood always smiling, ever-quiet, ever-tender. And I, a lost child, always frightened, I remember, That you came and found me blinded by unshed tears.  The tears we cry are echoes that tell what tomorrow can hold. And I wept in your arms and I heard Bells ring out across the land, bringing peace at last, To your heart my dearest friend.  And now, the love that you gave me blooms and will live on Through the tears in a song without end."
WWII = Waifu War II.  Would marry Alicia. Or Claudia. Or Marina. Or Audrey. Or Selvaria.
"Anime girls, Nazis, racism, homosexuality, and concentration camps.  WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT  10/10"
"I actually enjoed this game! Plot, gameplay, characters. It's really amazing! This game has stole my heart from me! 11/10 waiting for the sequel to be ported to PC."
"A Very Good Game, in and of itself.  REMEMBER, USE THE UP &amp; DOWN ARROW KEYS TO MAKE NEW SAVES, DO NOT BE LIKE ME AND ACCIDENTALLY OVERWRITE YOUR 14+ HOUR FAR SAVE DUE TRYING TO GET THE RUHM, THE BEST STORMTROOPER GUN IN THE GAME. I CRIED FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES AFTER REALIZING THAT I COULD DO THIS."
"Grew up drawing happy animals, Drew so many happy animals I thought I was going to be a teacher and make the world a happier place.  Said ♥♥♥♥ that.  Made a waifu army instead, enslaved hundreds of women to do my bidding and sent them into war on foot while I hid in a tank all safe and sound. Told my male soliders to trust me and that I would never betray them, Told them to go look for supplies, sent them into a minefield instead, eliminated all male competition, Only waifu for me. Set a J cup minimum entry requirement. Met the bustiest woman I've ever seen, Fell in love, But shock she was my enemy. Did the only right thing, killed her childhood lover with my bare hands and took her down to the beach to check out her melons.  The next time I draw an animal I'll put a mirror in the sketch book,   I am the real animal.  Game of the year."
"I don't always play anime games,  but when i do,  I only play Valkyria Chronicles."
"An exceptional strategy game. I wish the anime and jrpg elements didn't keep me from looking into and enjoying this game earlier. As it turned out those quirky japanese elements provided a nice console game charm, that as a PC gamer I haven't felt since my ps2 days.  Valkyria Chronicles instantly goes down as an all time classic for me."
Some of us have been waiting 6 YEARS just to play this game. I was almost tempetd to buy a PS3 just for this game.  The wait has finally ended and Valkyria Chronicles is on steam!  BUY THIS GAME MASTERPEICE NOW! I don't have to explain perfection!
"&gt;Be me &gt;Playing the Batomys mission &gt;Everything is going smoothly, almost done &gt;Then suddenly that's when things go south fast &gt;Selvaria appears &gt;♥♥♥♥ing Selvaria &gt;She rips through my comrades in mere seconds &gt;My team mates fired everything they had at her but with no luck &gt;The screams, oh God the screams they made when Selvaria got them &gt;Their dying words still haunt me to this day &gt;I still hate Selvaria to this day &gt;Haven't played since  10/10 would get ptsd again"
"Valkyria Chronicles is turn based tactical game surprisingly similar to Worms (or Hogs at War if you played that). You deploy your squad on an overhead map view, but when you select a unit, camera closes in and you move, take cover, aim the weapon and fire using shooter-like controls. You can move same soldier several times in a single turn and can also move after firing, if that soldier still have stamina remaining, but watch out - enemy soldiers will not stand idle during your turn and will fire at your active unit when you are not aiming, so there's always a feeling of pressure, even there's no timer.  All soldiers in your squad are unique, every one with his own name, face, voice and personality traits. These personality traits will even affect their performance on battlefield, in both bad and good ways. For example, responsible engineer will get a stat boost if she's the last to act during a turn, while scout-pacifist might randomly decide to disobey the attack order and refuse to shoot at the enemy. Soldiers can die permanently if they are downed for three turns or if an enemy soldier reaches them when they're in downed state. To save downed soldiers, move one of your still alive units to them and he will call the medic for evacuation.  Valkyria Chronicles takes place in the middle of what could be described as 'fantasy World War II'. It is unusual setting for japanese games and makes Valkyria Chronicles stand out among others. Sadly, the story itself is mediocre at best and face-palmingly stupid at worst points.  The worst thing about Valkyria Chronicles though is its battle ranking system. Speed of completion is the only factor that matters. This encourage the tactic of rushing in and capturing enemy home base as fast as possible, which will get boring soon."
"This the second time I finished Valkyria Chronicles. First time was on the 'ol Ps3. And now, much improved, on the PC.  Aside from the boost from 30fps to 60fps and sharper graphics, its not much different from the PS3 version.  Valkyria Chronicles can be summed up in one sentence: Advance Wars in wide arena 3D.  Thank you, Sega, for bringing this over to Steam."
"Not the type to brag but, struggling to efficiently clear maps? Unable to use each unit to their full potential? Repetitive unit death in each battle? Constant C-rank clears per map?  I think I'm the best strategist to ever grace this game.  After finishing the game, only one thought came to mind. Scouts are OP."
"Do i recommend this game?  I don't know, i just bought it twice. What do you think?  its also a kick ♥♥♥ port, which is a very pleasant surprise. 1080p 60fps runs smooth, the only downside is the cutscenes are locked to 720p, which is the only downside i have ran into.  If you even remotely like jrpgs or games like xcom this is a must buy!"
"If you have any interest in a Strategy RPG whatsoever you owe it to yourself to play Valkyria Chronicles. At $20 it is a great deal, It includes DLC that cost about $12 on PS3. Even now if you were to pick up a copy of the game on PS3, it would run you 15+ dollars in most cases, so for just a few bucks more you get all of the DLC as well.   The one thing that has bothered me about the port so far is that the time inbetween missions does not have mouse support, but it is still pretty easy to navigate with the keyboard.   Loadtimes are very quick, any 16/9 resolution that your monitor supports is supported by the game, and framerate is able to go as high as your monitor's refresh rate. None of that 'let's lock the game at 30 fps for no real reason' shenanigans. Also don't worry about the lack of graphical options. It seems like many of the textures scale with resolution.   Make sure to turn up your mouse sensitivity a bit if the controls feel a bit sluggish, it helped me out a lot personally. Other than that the controls are quite solid in their default state. As someone that has also played the PS3 version I would say that the controls are on par if not better than what was set up for the PS3 controller.   The cast of characters is quite large, and they all have their own quirks. A lot of them are likable too. There are a large number of squads you can field because of this, and even some characters with the same class can play a bit differently because of their personality traits.   The story covers quite a few serious war related issues, and there are a lot of great moments. Don't want to say too much about it though.   If it matters to anyone, Dual audio is present, so you can choose from the original Japanese, or English audio.   Buy this game. It is also quite fitting for Veteran's / Remembrance day. From what I have played so far it is a solid port and definitely worth the cost of admission.    TL;DR   Pros:  + Solid story.  + Great combat system where tactical decisions actually make a difference.  + Large cast of characters with many different possible squad make-ups.  + Smooth controls (turn mouse sensitivity up)  + TANKS.  + A good PC port.   + TANKS!  Cons:  - Mouse support not availiable in the menus.   - In engine cutscenes look a bit dated because it is a PS3 game from 2008.  - It took this long for it to come to PC."
a very nice and beautiful game with round based tactical gameelements that can be at times very hard still the game stays 'fair' somewhere i lost my most beloved sniper in a mission and the enemy took (killed) her it was long ago since i felt  so sad and uncomfortable while playing a game knowing that i ♥♥♥♥ed up ..that i let her die and that makes it also a great aspect of the game that all characters are so great that you get feels for the sidecharacters ....
"I love every part of this game, from the beautiful and artistic story to the strategic and sometimes quite difficult battles. I fully reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys games with great artwork and fun strategic gameplay. I will warn you though, some of the fights in this game are very hard and may seem completely unfair but I'm sure that if you try hard you can do it. This game was completely worth the money I spent on it. I do , however, reccommend waiting for the game to go on sale since steam has sales almost every weekend. Seriously just wait a week and you will only have to pay half the price and you can buy another wonderful game."
This game is amazing the only real down side i can think of is the lack of mouse support in the menus but it's only a minor inconvinence there's a great story line and tons of fun gameplay here and it's only $20 how could you not pick this up no seriously buy this if you haven't already
SEGA's hidden gem. Too bad they ♥♥♥♥ed up the sequels.
Thank you SEGA for this game on PC.
"Valkyria Chronicles is an absolutely fantastic turn-based/real-time strategy JRPG, that is certainly something very unique. The PC port handles excellently with only a couple of minor issues, that being the lack of mouse support in main menus and the pre-rendered cut-scenes still being in the console resolution and frame-rate.  The narrative captured my interest from the very beginning with an intriguing and somewhat satirical take on world war 2. The turn-based combat system is both unique and familiar, reminiscent of the likes of XCOM, while operating in real-time on a bar of movement points until the turn runs out in a third-person-shooter style.  It’s worth a look if you love strategy or JRPG’s and a fantastic story to boot!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW6ZXxw9sQI "

How do you keep a pregnant woman in labour safe? Put her in a tank and then go into combat of course!  GAME OF THE YEAR
"Kawaii World War 2. Dual audio, FPS synced to monitor refresh rate, modern resolutions, and very nice keyboard/mouse controls. A very tidy port of one of the PS3's best games, and a very interesting take on the strategy-RPG genre, which gives games such as Tactics Ogre, Front Mission and Disgaea a run for their money. Not only is it fun, but it's beautiful too. The Canvas Engine is one of the best things to come out of the last generation of consoles."
"This game is a blast! Oh, no pun intended.  From 3rd Person Shooter, to RTS, to JRPG, it's really dificult to describe this game, but in the best way possible. Concerining itself with problems of war while showing likeable characters that we like to get involved in battle, not to mention beautiful graphics and fantastic soundtrack and voiced bysome well-known anime voice actors, this game is great!"
"What do you get when Eternal Sonata, Fire Emblem, and World War II have a wild threesome? You get this amazing game. If you like SRPGs then this is a must own. Steam lacks in this genres department so lets show them we want more! Amazing job porting this game, controls very well with a keyboard and you could also use a pad if that suits you. Also runs very smoothly, I have had no problems. Only downside to this game is the sometimes not so good english voice acting but its not terrible, and the main guy sometimes sounds like Marty McFly. Could be my game of the year up there with The Banner Saga."
"One of the best game on PS3, now on PC.  The port is pretty decent although there are still minor problems they need to fix.  Overall the game is loads of fun with great gameplay, interesting characters and story.  If you like JRPGs and turn-based strategy you'll love Valkyria Chronicles."
"The best port of the year. 10 of 10. At last I can play my favourite tactical game on PC.  Controls are good for PC, but I could used a mouse support for menus ;)  SEGA done a damn good job - not like certainn other company with FFXIII port."
cute girls doing cute things in war
"One of the best japanese games on Steam so far.   +Gameplay  If your are looking for a fun JRPG with a turn based combat buy this NOW! (or better wait for sales, this is steam) it has been a while since I didn't enjoyed so much a JRPG and even more turn based ( ;_;). It's very addictive and the hours playing go very fast. Like in XCOM you will get affection to some characters of your squad and maybe for your bad decisions you will see them die. It's because that you will take so much care in the battle of what do you do and how. If you manage well your movements and tactics the game rewards you pretty well. After finish the game I just can say one bad thing about the combat, if you use orders with main characters you will become into a inmortal god (Rosie with orders = Rambo + Chuck Norris + Van Damme, insane). I killed the final boss in one turn in my first run.  +Story  It's not the best plot ever but is enough for catch you into the game. You will have some cliches recurrent of japanese games but thakfully the guionist do not overdo this situations (and other stupid situations for do everything more good looking like use a flare in the middle of enemy camp during a infiltration, Eh!! WE ARE HERE!!!) If you have watched Full Metal Alchemist it's the best explanation for describe the setting in this game, WWI weapons with some more actual tecnology, a country in the middle of a huge war, mysterious powers in the background... It's very close to FMA. Very recommended if you liked the anime. You also have a lot of lore for read if you are interested in the universe of the game and it will help you for understand better the actual war during the game. It's not a very dense lore so you dont will get bored reading a look of text.  +Characters  You have a plenty selection of characters for your squad and every one with his own background and story that's why you dont want see them die and you try finish every battle without a lose anyone, like a true commander in some way you get into that role very easy. I miss some new exclusive characters after finish the game like Selvaria (&lt;3) or Jagger. Anyways you have a lot of them for send to a certain death.  +Graphic options  It's a game of 2008, I was not expecting much but you have a lot of resolutions options and for diferent hz of your screen and that is always welcome. The game at this point can run even in a toaster and dont have any new features from consoles except the resolution.  +Control  I was expecting play this with a controller but it's perfectly optimized to keyboard and mouse and works better. Aim to the head with the 360 pad it's horrible.  +Duration  39 hours and I dont finished all the skirmishes and try to get rank A in every mission. The game is very complete and offer you a very reasonable amount of gameplay. Ready at Dawn take note please.  +Soundtrack  If you pay carful attention to the soundtrack in videogames like me I'm pretty sure you will love the ost of this game. A great soundtrack for a great game.  +Japanese Voices  Yes! Dual audio! please keep doing this. The english subtitles in some parts are not accurate with what the character is saying (this happens often in a lot of games) but the most part of the time it's a good translation from the japanese.   -User Interface  It's just a port with minimal changes with consoles but the main menu is horrible for navigate... You feel like 'ey I can click here and go fast to the next page' but no, you cant and you must open submenus. The graphic options can't be changed in the game and have a independent launcher just for that it's a little bit odd. Would have been nice a completly new interface thinking on pc and the posibility of use a mouse for navigate around the menus.   The game absolutely deserve the exist in Steam and I hope SEGA bring more japanese games to pc. Yakuza come to us."
"I bought the game on the PlayStation 3 back in 2010, I've invested over 600 hours on that version and this is the same great game but with achievements and 60fps gameplay.  If you like strategy games then you need to play this game, it's a loved game for a reason.  10/10"
"One of the best games ever made, now on PC! You might have to mess with the controls a bit to find a setting you like, but once you do you'll be in bliss! Includes the Japanese voice track as well, if you're into that."

"An interesting story combined with solid mechanics, this is a game I almost bought a Ps3 for. Is it worth it? Hell yes."
One of the best games of the last console generation comes to PC. The game itself is fantastic and the port is great too. A must for anyone who's into strategy games or RPGs.
"The reason to buy a PS3, now on PC. Words can't express the joy upon hearing this was coming to PC.  This game is a strategy JRPG. It used a custom engine for the time which blended a manga art style with a 3D engine. The engine was scaled down for the sequels which released for the PSP. This however, is the best version of it, the full version.  Valkyria Chronicles has a setting in a WWII technology world. However with one distinct difference, a lack of airpower. In a way Valkyria is a blending of ideas from WWI, WWII, and Napoleonic wars. Everything is centered around Ragnite. A miracle mineral used to both power vehicles and heal troops.  Mixed into this world are those descended from an ancient race who could manipulate Ragnite. Where the Valkyria name comes from. Imagine super soldiers with energy cannons that can decimate everything.  This all comes to pass in the nation of Gallia which holds the largest stockpile of Ragnite but is neutral to world affairs. Others want it, then are willing to do anything to capture it. There is a lot of political wrangling in the background of the story. But also at the root of it is many very dark undertones of hatred of Darcsens, Gallian natives who are heavily stereotyped in Gallian society.  There is common anime tropes at times but the story is extremely solid. Created by members of Sega's famed Overworks team. Those that missed the Dreamcast golden age, now is the time to see what Overworks was capable of.   Sega even did an anime based on this game, which is in some ways better. The ending of the anime is better than the game, makes more sense, but both are fantastic. Skies of Arcadia (The greatest Overworks title ever made) fans will even get a treat with cameos from Vyse, Aika, and Fina as all of their characters were snuck into this.   This is the kind of game Sega should be delivering to the PC crowd on a regular basis. I couldn't hold back from purchase the moment it was announced. My PS3 may never boot up again and I certainly want to see more titles like this making it to PC.   If you don't buy it for PC, buy it for PS3. I honestly bought a PS3 just to play this game and I didn't regret it one bit."
"A militarised Fire Emblem type of game? Count me in.  The gameplay offers the use of 5 different classes (Scout, Shock Trooper, Lancer, Engineer and Snipers) split with the many chosable units and 1 tank.   Instead of individual leveling of said units, the game asks to level up the classes instead. So no worries on switching up units there. For the tank, outfit it with stat modifiers.  Combat can be tough at times but enemies folow a set path in most so its possible.  Units can die permanently in combat if incaped during firefights and not rescued in time.  And special guest appearance of Skies of Arcadia heroes (Vyse as a Shock Trooper, Aika as a Scout and Fina being the Medic) is a plus, thanks Sega.  Includes all DLC released on the ps3.  Squad 7 (or Platoon 7), move out.  9/10"
"It's Anime World War 2 with tactical soldier gameplay and a Japanese twist. A lot of story and cutscenes to go through, but it's satisfying to complete a tough operation with minimal loses. The PS3 game that captured my interest years ago is still great and the port is good too. I'm really feeling it!"
"Valkyria Chronicles came out for the PS3 about 6 years ago and is a strategy RPG. This contains all the DLC and some touched up visuals. This is an EXCELLENT game. It basically takes the events of WW1/WW2 as in that both wars are/have happened and the land looks exactly like Europe. Everything else is different. You play as a member of a militia group from a small country that's on the defense from the eastern empire (Russia area).  Graphics have been touched up, it can be run at 4k pretty easily with GeDoSaTo. Running @ 4k and 60fps causes some issues with tanks being able to move up hills. The audio comes in english/japanese (and may have more, I never checked). It's a turn based strategy RPG. You level up your classes instead of individuals. You upgrade your weapons and tanks between missions. Grinding isn't really necessary. The way the game is potrayed, you can't redo story missions but you can replay 'skirmishes' over and over again if you want. It is helpful for new people to learn units strengths/weaknesses but it's absolutely n ot necessary to grind. I played every skirmish once and was able to beat the game without much issue.  This game is a lot of fun, a little challenging here and there. Has a great cast of characters with great voice acting. The story is really well done. I don't want to spoil certain parts but it handles some situations that don't get featured in games all that much well.   You can save practically anytime and quit if you have to run to do something!"

"A good port of a good game, reasonably priced and with all DLC. I already have the PS3 version, but hopefully if Sega detects an interest in this franchise from the PC community, they may localise the other two Valkyria games on pc."
"Yes, you should use that coupon you just got."

"Well well well... so after 6 years we finally get this game on PC. And apparently, the sales blew all expectations out of the water and made good old´ SEGA really happy, so hopefully that means part 2 and 3 will make their way to the west on PC as well.  This game is absolutely great! It has a bit more story than most games, and it´s also very story driven with the book chapter format, which means you really feel for the people in your squad after a while. It also helps that all characters are believable and distinct like real people.  The game has an interesting, tastefull approuch to handling difficult topics such as hate, revenge, racism, and &lt;!spoiler alert!&gt; deadly concentration camps. As anyone who looks at the store page can probably see, it basically takes place during world war 2 with different names for the participating countries and everything taking place in Europe. (or well, Europa...) Despite the overall seriousness the anime like story still has time for some nice extras like a sexy T&amp;A beach episode!!  Enough about the story, I am worried I might reveal too many spoilers for people who still have to play the game. Gameplay, then: it´s pretty good. It´s an interesting mix between third person shooter (GOW style) and turn based tactics. It works! Accept for some bad AI at times, but nothing too shokcing. Just that I have seen, for example, mortars not just missing my troops, but only hitting their own. And the like. But nothing which breaks gameplay.   Graphics are great, anime/waterpainting style. :D  finally, about the port. It´s decent. good keyboard/mouse controls (altoughI use x360 controller), 60 fps or highser support, low sys reqs, and support for any resolution including 4k with textures etc. automatically scaling in quality.Pretty good, sega!  All in all, I definitely recommend this game! :3"
"It is an amazing game which manages to portray the attrocieties of war and makes the player want to not stop untill the game is over. The game itself is basicly an anime which then gives the player control during battle and also allows them to customize, train and upgrade the units and weapons used. For those put off by its 'cute' art style at first just give it some time because you will fall in love with what Valkyria Chronicles has to offer. This game has made me want sega to port over Valkyria Chronicles 1 and 2...even if 2 is not that great, I still want them both.  To sum up, if you like anime, turn-based-strategy and getting attached to characters then this is the game for you."
"Ok, given how much time I've ended up spending on this game, I think it's only fair to give a review.  I'm not normally a fan of japanese games - by japanese, I don't mean games from japanese devs - I mean the kind of anime games that are reeking in japanese culture, with cute cartoon girls and edgy teens. I though this game would be the same at a glance, but I ended up picking it up on someones recomendation when it was on sale. My friend described the game to me as X-COM set in WW2, and I love X-COM.  The setting is a fictional, almost alternate reality WW2, or the second Europan War as the game calls it. Two large empires are fighting for a fictional resourse neccessary for the survival of their empires, and it just so happens that you're peaceloving neutral country sit's upon a huge stockpile of the stuff. The forces invade your hometown, so in retaliation, you take control with 'Squad 7', a local militia, with the goal of liberaing the country. This involves inventory management, the researching of new equipment, squad training and more.  Whilst this doesn't sound like a very unique storyline, the way in which the games explores the war, while still maintaining a very fictional feel to it is very gripping and individual. Without spoiling too much, you see close friends die, Nazi Germany scale attrocities, and locations which you grow an attachment to destroyed. In addition to this, the game features some highly addicting X-COM style squad management gameplay, both in and out of battle. The challenging gamplay, gripping story, and refreshing presentation all make for a great game.   This is a 10/10 in my book, the best game I've played in 2014."

"Like XCOM, but anime, and more cheerful. Nothin' says leisure like an anti armor tank round through the chest of your sniper."
"The wait is worth it. Valkyria Chronicles was actually the game that made me buy a PS3 before and I'm glad that it made it to Steam as more people should definitely experience this masterpiece. Visually stunning, fascinating story and interesting gameplay; this game should be in your library forever."
"If you like new breed of turn based strategy, Valkyria Chronicles is the game for you  The Good Story line is great Very cool cel shaded animation Really fun to play works best with a controller  The Bad though there are minor problems with the controls using mouse and keyboard Low resolution scenes     "
"There are a lot of games that while contemporary are regarded as 'classic' or 'masterpieces', but don't hold up well when you go back to them years later. Their luster fades, their novelty no longer feels like anything more than a cheap gimmick, and modern successors do what they did better. Valkyria Chronicles is not one of these games.  Every bit as fresh today as it was in 2008, VC is perhaps the most singularly inspired tactical RPG to ever come into existance, seemingly arising out of nowhere with wholly unique gameplay, a fully realized setting full of fantastic worldbuilding, and a cast of characters as memorable as they are lovable.  If you love strategy games, RPGs, or just games that are truly original, you owe it to yourself to experience one of the best games ever made."
"What many consider to be one of the greatest and most overlooked gems on the PS3 finally hits Steam! Obviously, it's the same game you played in 2008, only with a higher resolution, framerate, and (arguably) better controls.  This shouldn't have come as a surprise to me, but as a result of many abysmal PC ports by other companies, it did. This game has mouse support! While the menus and chapter select screens don't have a mouse cursor and make you navigate with the keyboard, the actual battles fully support the mouse, and it works absolutely perfectly. I would recommend you increase the mouse sensitivity, however; the initial setting of 50 is a bit low and I found 75 to be much better.  Unlike Final Fantasy XIII's recent PC release, Sega actually allows us to change the game's resolution to just about anything we could ask for. What a concept, right? While the pre-rendered cutscenes are still locked at the PS3's 1280x720 resolution, the battles look absolutely amazing in 2560x1440p at 60+ frames per second.  In an age where many console-centric companies see the goldmine that is Steam and decide to hastily and carelessly port their games over, Sega has done us an enormous favor and made a very respectable port of one of the best games on the last generation of consoles. If you've never played the original on PS3, you absolutely owe it to yourself to pick it up now. If you're like me and have played the PS3 version to death, you still owe it to yourself to pick it up again to experience all of the enhancements that the PC version brings. If we're lucky, maybe Sega will decide to port over Valkyria Chronicles 2 and, if we're very lucky, Valkyria Chronicles 3 to Steam."
"So far this PC port seems like it's really well done. Before i go into detail i would like to introduce the actual game to people who are interested in it.  If you just want to know about the port quality, you can skip this part  To sum the story up really fast: This game is about a war set in 1935 EC between 2 powers in europe, the Empire in the east and Atlantic Federation in the west, that are in need of a specific ressource. The Empire crossed the border to the west an attacked, thus starting the second european war. Your place in the game is Gallian, a country that always stayed neutral so far, but now has to fight and defend themselve because the country possesses huge amounts of the needed ressource. The story is told like a tale from a book, chapter by chapter. You will have a lot of cutscenes, maybe more than some people would like to.  The gameplay could be described as a strategic and really advanced worms with more specific mechanics. It's turn based with different units which can be upgraded. People who enjoy this type of game will definitely have fun with VC.  Regarding the port:  The port seems really solid. Keyboard and mouse controls might need some practice, but they are working fine. Resolution and frame rate are changeable, no crashes or performances problems (frame drops etc.) so far. Only thing i noticed is, that the cut scene aren't affected by frame rate changes. These still seem to be in 30 FPS, also not sure about resolution changes effecting them. Doesn't matter to much, because it still looks great.   Only thing that bugs me is, that the changes to sound volume don't really adjust the cutscene volume. At least not for me. So consider turning down the master volume on your windows mixer instead of the volume control in the game to have some consistent colume changes.  Other than that: If you know this game, if you enjoyed it on PS3, if you want to support SEGA and you want it on PC with all DLCs for 20 bucks or whatever, i think it's safe to say, that you can buy this. If you are still unsure, i recommed watching some streams on Twitch.tv first before buying."
10/10 would Alicia rush again.
"A sleeper hit in 2009, Valkyria chronicles was one of the most beautiful games on the ps3.  Now that it has come to steam, everyone can enjoy this beautifully ported exclusive.  New features in the port include a fully mapped out keyboard controls that flow smoothly with gameplay, with the addition of 60 FPS gameplay (up from 30 FPS from the ps3 original) and resolutions exceeding the average 1080p offerings.   This is a must play game, and I hope that you'll enjoy playing it as much as I did !"
"This is a rather unique game. Having played lots of JRPGs on PS1 and PS2, I'd honestly have to say I've never encountered game play mechanics quite like this. Though much of the story is presented in a somewhat manga inspired 'talking heads' panels format, the game is suprisingly polished in so many ways. The stylized 'drawn' graphics, the comic book text sound effect words hovering over things in game, along with a nice bit of background information on characters, weapons, and the world available to read, and a story that's (thus far) been pretty fun all contribute to the game's uniqueness. The combat system is also interesting, combining third person perspective real-time control elements with turn based strategy elements.  Though by no means difficult, the game does offer a reasonable challenge on first play through, requiring thoughtful consideration of how much you want to upgrade your troop's levels through repeatable skirmishes. There are often a few approaches to combat situations depending on how you utilize your 'orders' (aka special temporary buffs) and class types.  I've not quite beaten it yet, and though the story has a rather cliche love interest as a dominant part of the storyline, it's been a fun game thus far.  Definately worth grabbing for $5 to $10 if you appreciate the art of game design. They did a lot of things right in this one, and the PC port is pretty solid (though I suggest using a control pad for moving your tank around. The controls get a little weird on tank movement if done with a mouse.)"
"Valkyria Chronicles is a very welcomed port from the original PS3 game. This port shares the originals strong points and even allow us to run it at 60fps which makes this game feel so much smoother.  The game itself has stunning hand-drawn graphics accompanied with a beautiful soudtrack composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, also known for his work on games like Final Fantasy Tactics, Final Fantasy XII, GrimGrimoire, Breath of Fire V, etc. Lovable characters, pretty damn awesome story, fun, simple and solid battle system... Considering all this comes with all the DLCs of the initial release, it's well worth every penny you'd spend on it."
"Music that is not only amazing but also quite powerful. An engrossing story with fantastic characters (Jann is a personal favorite). Beautifully rendered. Works quite well on the PC.  If you like the anime-style/don't mind it, definately consider it. I regret not playing as soon as I bought it."
"Good story, interesting and relatable characters, great audio, unique graphic presentation/theme and of course unique gameplay. Plus, Welkin spews some good wisdom and philosopy..  Can be difficult and frustrating at times  Did not experience bug, crash, or performance drop in a whole playthrough.. why can't more games be like this?   I'd very much like to see the sequel coming. Thank you for this, dev"
"A very enjoyable tactical-shooting game, with beautiful graphic and characters.  Though in early game the snipers and lancers would miss as often as when you play in XCOM: E.U, but thankfully, mid game they become better, when best equipped, they're your dependable killing-machines.  Sorry if I sound bitter with the chance of misses, but it really gets on my nerve at times. I guess its a step we'll have to face when playing tactical shooting games. Nevertheless, Valkyria is a great (old) game that I've cherished since the minute I played it. Good graphics, even the characters are adorable with their background and shortcomings. Especially love Alicia, Rosie and Selvaria! You will need a lot of time to gett used on how to battle the enemies, and getting an A-rank in every chapter. It os well advised to watch some guides if you're trying to complete all the Medals provided.  The Valkyrur effect is also awesome :)  You really should buy this. The best in Valkyria Chronicles ever."
Almost done with the game. Hope they remake the psp version of 2 and 3 for the PC.
I'm loving this story!
"Holy crap, 10 hours in and I'm showing no signs of putting this down! Screw console exclusives! I wish I had gotten my hands on this game sooner. I've always loved games that had you recruit a plethora of characters that you can level up and equip to take with you into battle. It's kinda got that JRPG element going on with the turn based battle system, but does it in a unique way. Fan-♥♥♥♥in'-tastic! Really hope the sequels find their way onto Steam as well I want to play the hell out of this franchise!"
"This game is a mix between advance wars, fire emblem and most WW2 games. Though the WW2 setting is set in a fictional universe, the plot itself gives a much better experience than most shooters. I really enjoy the game's character designs and the method of presentation their gameplay. It was nicely introduced so that the player can digest slowly and learn how to experiment with their tactics and such.  My comments about the gameplay is a mix between the usual RTS and third person shooters. I really liked this combination. This requires some planning before striking your enemies and advancing through the game.  Each character has a unique combination of attributes that may be advantageous or prove to be a disadvantage at certain situations. This gives a very nice blend of mixing the character combinations and see how it works out. I hope there would be a relationship feature or character interaction in or out of battles just like in fire emblem.  The music kind of reminds me about my days playing Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and A2.  The developers design for this world gives some sort of an anime world, but that isn't much of a surprise from a game from japan.  Though I really wished to replay old mission as I wanted to do better.   ANd the interphase change to accomodate PC gamers is satisfactotionary, I need some time to get accustomed to play this game.  Overall, this is a game that is worth your money, I never regretted buying this game and I really hope a sequel might come up but I doubt that. Overall:9.5/10 Gameplay:9/10 Music: 9/10 Interphase change from PS3 to PC:6/10 Plot:10/10 Character design:10/10 Replayability:8/10"
"Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR) is at the bottom.  To start, Valkyria Chronicles (I will refer to it as VC) was released in North America on November 4th, 2008 for the Sony PlayStation 3. VC had two more sequels released in the following years of 2010 and 2011. VC 3 was released in Japan only, and neither of the sequels were able to live up to the original game. If you want to read reviews about the PS3 version, which is identical to this version, I would suggest you start here:  http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/valkyria-chronicles .  PC reviews here:  http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles   I personally have sunk many hundreds of hours into the PS3 version. The game’s main positive attribute is the amazing story, which is masterfully voiced in both English and Japanese. The awesome soundtrack is beautifully composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, who has also created scores for Final Fantasy titles. The extremely unique and breathtaking watercolor graphics produced by the CANVAS engine make this game’s art style literally one-of-a-kind, and now it looks even better in high definition thanks to the work done by SEGA to release the game on PC. The game also took advantage of Nvidia’s PhysX technology to simulate realistic physics for debris, hair, clothing, grass, and more on the PS3. Without a doubt, this technology will be coming to PC along with the game, and possibly be even better than before. The game also boasts its own type of gameplay style; I would describe it as “a turn-based real-time third-person-shooter strategy RPG”, yes, turn-based and real-time together. The game’s characters are very easy to identify with, or at least make a personal connection to one of them. Throughout the story, the cast (50 playable characters with unique personalities) will have to find strength to fight in a war they never wanted, and to find solace in even the grimmest situations. Each one of the characters carries their own personal set of “perks”, or as the game calls them, “potentials.” These unlock overtime, and throughout the game the roster of more than one hundred characters each have a different set of eight “potentials”, some good, and some bad. For example, a unit may gain the ability to occasionally fire off a barrage bullets without the enemy having any chance to dodge from the aptly named “undodgeable shot” potential. Or, a unit may slowly lose hit points during their turn because they are allergic to the terrain. This makes for a great strategic gameplay mechanic as you will have to change your line up of soldiers for each mission in order to have the best possible team for the situation.  Short Version: +Great Story +One-of-a-kind art style +Great Soundtrack +Great Characters +Great Gameplay +DLC included  TL;DR Get. This. Game. Perfect Port!"
5 minutes into the game im arrested by my waifu 10/10
I sold my ps3   10/10 would sell again
"Now this is a darn fine game.  Valkyria Chronicles is a gorgeous, fascinating combination of strategy and third person shooter. The game takes place in an allegorical version of Europe in World War II and follows the citizen soldiers of Squad Seven as their country of Gallia is invaded by the much larger Empire. I found the characters extremely likable and the story to be engaging.  As solid as the story is, however, the traits that stood out the most to me were the presentation and gameplay. As is evidenced by the screenshots, the game is flat out gorgeous. The entire thing looking like a pencil drawing that is as majestic in motion as it is in stills. And the combination of a top-down turn-based tactical map that transitions into a real-time third person view works astoundingly well.  When Valkyria Chronicles was a PS3 exclusive, I recommended it to everyone I could. Now that it’s on Steam, I’m excited to do the same again."
"This game is aesthetically incredible. Tactical gameplay is familiar but the real time turns keeps it very fresh. Characters are great and memorable through strong voice-acting, backstory, and design. The world seems to have a rich history but the overarching story itself is a little bit lacking compared to the rest of the game.  Overall, one of my favorite games of all time. Definitely a good choice if you enjoy semi-casual tactics games and worth a try if you like jrpgs in general."
"This a true masterpiece, a gem of the PS3 and my favorite SRPG/game of all times! Amazing gameplay, great graphics and story, awesome soundtrack, fun characters.  This is a great port from SEGA, and i recommend this game to EVERY SINGLE PERSON on steam. If there's still gamers out there without steam, well... install it and buy this game, i mean it.  10/10 would buy it again."
Great Story. Low end computer can play very well. 9/10
"Normally i don't bother writing reviews, but for this game, I'll make an exception. Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing game in which you will love the characters, story, original gameplay and visuals. It is probably one of the best games I've played in the last year, and I've played a ton this year. The best way to describe this game is: a great anime with gameplay mixed in. Even if you aren't into anime itself, but are just looking for a game with a good story, Valkyria Chronicles got you covered. The game is presented to you in a book with different chapters, each chapter has a number of episodes which can contain: gameplay, cutscenes or dialogue scenes. Visually, Valkyria Chronicles is also very appealing. The game looks like an anime, but with a sort of painted vibe to it.  Valkyria Chronicles' story isn't always about the pure fighting in a war, but really gives you a look at the lives of those soldiers fighting the war. Because of this, you really start to care for the characters, and might cry when one of them dies in battle (because the game has a permadeath system, but I'm not sure if this also applies to the main characters). But the main characters aren't the only ones you will get to know, because every unit you can use in the game has it's own backstory (although not as extensive as the MC's). During the game, there will be moments where you go through all kinds of emotions, from laughing to even crying.  The gameplay in itself is pretty solid and an entirely new take on the turn-based strategy. Each turn, you have a number of Command Points (CP). These CP determine the amount of moves you can make, so you can move the same unit more then once. Using a birds-eye view, you determine which unit you're going to move and to where. Once you pick a unit, the game changes to a third-person perspective, and you can move the unit like in third-person games for as long as you have action points (AP). Once per move, the unit can also take an action. I would love to see this kind of gameplay again, the only throwback is that the screen in which you choose which unit you want to move doesn't always have a clear image of the environment (especially in the beginning). This resulted in me sometimes picking a unit, thinking i could move somewhere, only to realise that there's a steep hill in the way."
"A top notch JRPG from SEGA that has been ported well to accommodate PC playability with ease.   Turn-based, action point system of combat makes strategy and planning an important factor for gameplay. Aggrevating at first, but once you get the hang of it, you learn to make the best of your limited move-pool and skillfully take out opponents in seconds.   Story is rich and told in chapters of a storybook. Cutscenes are impactful and full of emotion.   Character development is excellent. From the beginning of the war to the end, the main characters clearly undergo psychological and emotional changes that fit perfectly with the plot. And duh, romance.  Would definitely recommend this game if you like RICH STORIES and TURN-BASED STRATEGY GAMES."
"“Oh, maaan, Ted's so good,” Cherry gushed to Marina as she signalled the sniper up the ladder, “He totally knows just when to ease up, and just when to, like, push harder... he's totally incredible!” Marina Wulfstan climbed up silently, wishing to herself that the noisy scout would miraculously keep to herself while she was here. Marina vaulted the end of the ladder, already in motion, dragging the body of the patrolman clear from the ledge before setting down.   Cherry Stijnen bunkered down against a chimney, reminiscing on another well-spent night in a Ted's company. “And he loves warming up as much as doing it,” she continued, “he takes off my dresses real slow, takes care not to just rip my clothes off... like, he treats me like a present, like, the kind with the pretty wrapping you want to keep, y'know?”   Marina clearly didn't know, and didn't care. She crouched down over the edge of the building, staying out of sight while scoping the surroundings. “Two shocktroopers by the objective,” she reported in, ever mindful of her role in the team, “Engineer and shocktrooper bunkered on the east side, light tank providing cover. Scout concealed in foliage further east, no clear shot. Orders, commander?”  “This is a surprise attack,” Welkin answered over the radio, “Take out as many shocktroopers as you can to cover our scouts' advance, then the engineer to make Largo's lancers stick to that tank. Rosie, take care of anything out of Marina's sights.”  “I don't blame him, though,” Cherry effortlessly segued, “they are beautiful clothes. Got them through a mail-order catalogue in Gallian Girl. Took like forever to save up for them, but they were totally worth it. You know, you should try something flowy sometime, Marina. It'd feel, like, so much better than those jeans and tees you always wear, y'know? You'd totally look better for it...”  “Ugh...Stijnen's right here, surely she can handle one scout,” Marina reasoned with the commander, squeezing the trigger and hearing the satisfying thud of an enemy falling dead. Please, get her away from me...  “Negative,” Welkin replied, “if something goes wrong you'll need the support. Cherry will back you up. Until we're in position, the field is yours.”  “...roger, commander,” Marina acquiesced, her shoulders lumping with a dejected sigh as she lined up a shot. Cherry noticed this, and moved to her comrade as she fired, dropping another trooper.  “Aw, don't worry, sweetie,” she cooed into Marina's ear with a pat on her shoulder that would've ruined the sniper's shot, “It's not a lost cause! Once we get you into some good clothes, you'll be totally hot! Of course, we'd have to do something with those nails, too... mmmaybe some eyeshadow wouldn't go astray, either... but it's probably mostly the hair. We need to totally pull it away from your eyes, y'know, let the guys know, like, what they're getting...”  You stay the hell away from my hair. “That's wonderful, listen,” Marina managed through gritted teeth, looking up with a glare that stopped Cherry in her tracks, “I need to concentrate on this, okay?”  “Oh, um, like, totally...” Cherry sat back down, watching the quiet woman absorb herself in her task. Marina could still feel the scout's eyes on her, and it unnerved her. Her aim was wandering over the enemy shocktrooper; arm, torso, leg, neck, clean air... She felt agitated around anyone, let alone someone as obnoxious as her. She felt the eyes on the back of her head leave, and her aim steadied...  “We could probably do something about that personality of yours too,” Cherry commented, getting straight back into it, “it's no wonder the guys don't look twice at you...”  What the ♥♥♥♥!? Marina's hands shook violently as she pulled the trigger, executing what was possibly the worst shot she had ever fired in her military career. The shocktrooper was thrown from his feet, a bullet flying through his lower leg. He went down with a cry, and a grimace of pain, alerting all his friends to the hostile presence. Marina shot Cherry a glare that froze blood.  “Damn... Turner, move forward and finish that guy off. Wulfstan, what's going on?” Welkin asked from the radio, as the screams of the poor shocktrooper intensified briefly, before petering out. “Are you under attack? I can get Nelson there to back you two up...”  Marina steeled her gaze at Cherry. “Won't be necessary, commander,” she said coolly, “I can deal with it.” Marina reached over, grabbing the scout by the scruff of the neck. Cherry gasped in surprise as the sniper pulled her close, and placed her lips over hers.  What..? Cherry's eyes went wide as Marina's mouth closed over hers, as her tongue explored Cherry's own, lapping and drawing at it, trying to coax it into action, action that Cherry's mind couldn't make through the shock of being kissed by another woman. She's..! Cherry sat paralyzed under the ministrations of the sniper, and could only look blankly at her as she closed the kiss, pulling away gently, smirking at the scout. She pushed Cherry back sharply, Cherry falling flat on her behind as Marina turned back to the road below.  “My roof,” Marina said, as she cocked her rifle, lining up a shocktrooper on the ground. She's... Cherry managed to herself as Marina put a bullet through the enemy's eyeball.   “My rules,” Marina cocked again, turning to the rear base and lining up a second, sliding a slug under his visor. Cherry could still only manage to sit and stare bug-eyed at the woman, the synergy of weapon and soldier in efficient, cold-blooded unison, cocking her rifle a third time in as few seconds.  “My way.” she finished, planting the third round into the engineer's ear, who went down like a sack of potatoes.  Welkin's voice crackled again. “The road's clear! Lancers, scouts, move up and clear that tank!”  The whistle of Largo's rocket screamed from the street, ending with a deep, resonating explosion, the shot a direct hit on the tank's radiator, destroying the vehicle in one deft move. Alicia moved forward, her footsteps echoing on the cobblestone road. Marina smiled as she surveyed her handiwork, quickly glancing at the frozen scout before turning back to the ladder, leaving Cherry to gather her thoughts.  She's... she's good... She wasn't sure if she meant a good soldier or a good kisser."
"Fabulous and gorgeous from the first sight, very original to its core and very japanese with that, inheriting all those special 'J' things, like the gals with big eyes and boobs, and cute little pet everyone loves... etc.  I've made two different opinions on this game: as a game enthusiast, who loves different approaches, unstandard design decisions, it's - 'Whoa! 9.5/10! Best for every money!'  But as a gamer with tendency to realism and perfectionism... while playing I was confused so many times trying to get those achievements... so I'm not feeling the game concept was right. In fact, there was so many furious 'Why?!!' and 'Oh, really?!' while I was getting a perfect from this game, so my final count drops to 7/10.  Buy it, if you're a fan of the games in total, or if you're deep into all the 'J' stuff. The game will perfectly suits in your collection. And DON'T buy Valkyria Chronicles, if you can't stand anime stuff for long and want all the achievements. Or if you want a realistic story about war. Or good tactics game. Because there, to get 'A' ('SS') rating, you need to forget about good strategies like move carefully, stay covered, flanking enemies and so on. To get 'A' rating you need to pick one scout and run like hell on enemies positions, dodging tons of bullets.  One of the most intriguing features at the start of the game as unique bio's on every soldier in your squad, meaning different behavior at the battlefield... quickly becomes a burden, because almost everybody are broken in some way. That means, you cannot collect a dream team, you need to pick different people for every mission, even for different terrains, and hey! it is not so easy, because of the way the management in the game organized. To speak of controls in the general... well, optimization from console to the PC went not too bad, but controls, and more of all, use of the mouse... can be a real pain. Especially while driving a tank (another potentially great feature went really bad on PC).  Well, like I already said, game's a facinating - for anime fans, and may be even dull for those who aren't. Tread carefully!"
"I don't have time to play this game but I'm still playing it. It's that good. For all fans of Vandal Hearts, this is a must-play. Come on with the sequels already!"
Best turn-based anime I have ever played.
Missed a anti tank round shot and blew up my own barricade and failed the mission. 10/10
Company of X:Com: the Anime  Oh this is also a good port that has options and key remapping.
"I am not even going to attempt to explain this game. I would not make it justice.  But I will say this: buy it. Buy it because you love squad-based tactical skirmish games with a lot of depth and character progression.   Or buy it because you melt in front of beautifully narrated yet completely off the wall storytelling  a la japonaise .  Maybe you are both of those (I am). Even better.  At the very least, buy it because we need to send a strong signal to the idiotic marketeers out there: yes, we dig lovingly handcrafted games that may make no sense to you, and yet is sheer genius. "
"Sublime Strategy RPG and a treat to any strategy fan out there  the game features a mix of turn based tactics, RPG elements and third person shooting, you play through numerous missions and take direct control of your troops (one at a time) in a third person perspective, the main story is very lengthy, it took me over 40 hours to finish, and the game includes the DLC missions of the original PS3 release so theres extra content to tackle and you can easily exceed the 50 hour mark  the story is basically about the NOT-second world war in the continent of NOT-Europe, the game features a watercolor painting/anime artstyle that really hasnt aged one bit, it still looks gorgeous and the game runs at 60 FPS and resolutions of 1080p (AND BEYOND) unlike the initial PS3 version, is a quality PC port with only a few problems here and there that shouldnt get in the way of the overall experience, the presentation truthly is magnificent  the plot itself is pretty decent, its told in a similar fashion to an anime series (including a beach episode of course) with the action scenes being the battles themselves, i say the weakest point might be the voice cast which merely perform an adequate job, of course this is just my personal opinion and i believe the only people to ever do justice to the original japanese voice cast in pretty much any anime is the latin american dub, so take this criticism with a grain of salt, and besides, the game includes the original japanese dub so this weak point can be avoided  you will feel, you will laugh and you will cringe, its anime all the way  my major complain about the game is how scripted some missions are, to the detriment of the experience, some missions will have long unskippable sequences you have to endure, some will make you face infinitely respawning enemies, some will limit your unit selection greatly, limiting your strategic options, etc. this aspect could been handled much better  overall fantastic game, recommended all the way, well worth the entry price"
great game wasnt sure if the port was going to do it justice but it did really glad to be fighting in galia again
"Gameplay: great. It's not very tactical at times and the AI is really bad (either scripted to stay in place or run to a pre-defined destination), but the unique mixture of third person-perspective action and turn-based strategy somehow works very well, making the game approachable for the fans of both genres. Missions are varied and don't let the player get bored by repetitive actions. The game is very enticing and it's too easy to suddenly realize that it's 2 AM now and you have spent half of the night playing.  Story: characters are cliche and plot is cliche as well. Whoever wrote them though made a very good use of those cliches though, making the characters very likeable and easy to get attached to. Sure, it's not the greatest piece of fiction world has ever seen, but it works. If you're a teenager and this is your first jRPG, you will probably love it.  Graphics: stylized to look like hand-drawn Japanese animation. If that's not your thing, you may have a problem, but otherwise it's clear and easy on the eyes. The port to PC was done very well so framerate is smooth. As a side note, character design was taken care of by a rather well-known hentai artist and, surprisingly, did not result in tons of fanservice but rather gave the game a no-nonsense war fiction feel.  Sound: I'm obviously biased here as the music was done by my favourite VGM composer, Hitoshi Sakimoto (Final Fantasy Tactics, Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy XII among others). I will spare you from singing praises, just listen to the battle tracks which he excels at. Voice acting is very competent in Japanese version and average in English, where it's hit or miss. If you don't mind a liberal translation, Japanese voices and English subtitles are probably the best way in this case.  Summary: definitely worth buying and playing. This kind of game is what you would expect to see on handheld consoles, which is all the more reason to try one when it finally got a PC version. Score: 9/10"
cute anime grills and a host of unforgettable characters brilliant turn based strategy and gameplay vibrant ww2 atmosphere and incredible soundtrack and a glorious pc port what more is there to say? get this game already!
A wonderful port of one of the best PS3 games. Worth every penny. Hope SEGA brings the other games of the saga.
"A really well optimized, great port. Much superior than the PS3 version. Hey Square Enix, you could learn a thing from Sega here!"
"I can't say much about the gameplay and story yet, but I'm very, VERY impressed with the quality of this port. I signed the petition to SEGA a long time ago and was surprised with the news that this game was coming to PC after such a long time, I'm kind of broke but pre-ordered it anyway.  However, I was very afraid if I could run this on my toaster (NVIDIA 640m) based on my terrible experience with the Final Fantasy XIII port and was overwhelmed when I tried to change the resolution to 1080 and got solid 60 FPS along with some tears of joy. I can't recall another game that played so smoothly on my toaster. This is ****ing great. Dark Souls II port is awesome too, I think FROM and SEGA are doing a nice work with the master race community, but we want more! So, please, SEGA, bring us Resonant of Fate too so I can pre-order it too, just TAKE MY FREAKING MONEY!  I will tell about the game itself once I have the time to play it, but, overall, 10/10."
"A WW2 Era game with some fantasy aspects. Interesting game with a vast cast of characters to go through in the Personnel tab, who will evolve as you use them in missions more. Kinda like understanding more of themselves and their base characteristics and how they were drafted into the military. Challenging missions, but it is sometimes difficult to plan your strategy when you have no idea what the enemy is going to do next, but I suppose that is part of the fun.  A very good port over game from the console platform. Controls are smooth with the keyboard and viewing mechanics are possible with the mouse. English subtitles with Japanese voice? Yes please. There is English dub for those who prefer that. It plays like XCOM: Enemy Unknown but without the grids.   9/10 would recommend. Would play again."
Even my poor laptop can run this thing on almost 30FPS. Now please remove the IP Block on PSO2 ;_;
"Valkyria Chronicles is what happens when the country that brought us Final Fantasy, Hello Kitty, and Princess Mononoke decides to remake X-Com. Alternatively, it's what happens when the country that brought us Code Geass decides to remake Final Fantasy Tactics, except with tanks.  It's the 1930s on NOT EARTH and NOT RUSSIA is invading NOT FRANCE in order to capture their supplies of NOT OIL in order to continue supplying their NOT WORLD WAR TWO campaign against NOT THE ALLIES. You play as Welkin Gunther, the son of the former hero of NOT WORLD WAR ONE who has, for some reason, inherited his father's tank. Seriously. The thing is just sitting in his barn as if it were his dad's old Mustang, and not, you know, an armored weapon of war.   The plot takes the Final Fantasy Tactics approach of having a linear campaign with some side missions you can do to grind levels if needed. There is an interesting storytelling conceit in that the framing device for the game is a history book written about the exploits of your character and his squad during the war. . . like Final Fantasy Tactics. Except this is different because instead of moving a glowing dot around a map, you're turning pages in a book. And stuff.   That's basically the game. You watch a bunch of cut scenes, do a tactical combat mission, then watch some more cut scenes. Occasionally you visit your headquarters to train up your troops and research new weapon technology. So basically, what will make or break the game for you is A. how much you're willing to put up with linear storytelling, and B. how much you like the combat.   I happen to like the combat a lot. Most of the combat takes place on a top-down map, with your units and the enemy units represented as circular icons. You receive a certain number of 'Command Points,' based on the mission and the number of special character units you take along with you. Each Command Point allows you to activate a unit one time. During it's activation, you jump into the unit's head, controlling it directly Gears of War style. During each activation, you can move a certain distance and take one attack. Attack accuracy is based on weapon and character skill, headshots deal extra damage.   Interesting enough, Valkyria Chronicles seems to take a page from the tabletop game 'Infinity,' or perhaps the old board game 'Space Hulk.' Rather than going down the list and activating each unit once, you can choose to use multiple command points to activate a unit multiple times. This gives you a chance to, say, take a followup shot with your sniper when RNG screws you on the first shot, or unload multiple rocket rounds into a tank with your one anti-tank dude.  Characters are divided into five classes. Scouts carry bolt-action rifles, move fast, and have the best vision range. Lancers are slower, but carry anti-tank rockets that can penetrate tank armor. Engineers are a bit slower than Scouts, but are still fairly fast, and can repair your tank and replenish ammo supplies. Snipers are the slowest, but have great accuracy at long range. Shock Troopers. . . do something, I guess. I still haven't figured out how best to use these guys.   And then there's the tank. It's a tank. It's awesome. It can roll over enemy emplacements, shrug off small-arms fire, and blast the hell out of their tanks. On the other hand, if it blows up, you lose. And it costs 2 Command Points to activate.  All this ends up forcing you to use the kind of combined arms tactics that characterized World War II. You end up using your tank as mobile cover for your infantry, picking off enemy Lancers while the Tank clears a path. Or you end up using the tank to bombard enemy positions to clear firing lines for your infantry. Good, fun stuff.   TL:DR version: It's X-Com meets Final Fantasy Tactics. If that sounds fun, give it a shot."
Please do everyone a favor and buy this game instead of Assassins Creed Unity.  1-It's cheaper 2-It's a better game 3-it's a much better port 4-Twintail girl 5-Good keyboard &amp; mouse controls 6-It isn't a franchise that has more than 10 games and they all are pretty much the same 7-It's even selling more than AC Unity on it's release date
My favourite game on the PS3 comes to Steam! It's got great gameplay with an exciting and beautiful storyline! I'm really looking forward to playing this again and again! Can't recommend it enough!
"Very good storyline from what i can tell, good characters and a hell of a lot of fun during gameplay, very promising going into the next hours of gameplay  Sadly it seems my PC has some minor problems running Valkyria Chronicles but its only minor flicker here and there, something i can deal with.  Can only recommend it to everyone who loves a good storyline, anime(to some degree) and WW2 Scenarios"
A wonderful port of one of the best PS3 games. Worth every penny. Hope SEGA brings the other games of the saga.
This is the best game Sega has ever made.
"I'll leave the extansive reviews to someone more invested in them, but World War Anime is actually one of the closer games to a tabletop wargame and is tons of fun.   Would love to see a new level creator, but eight years after publication that seems unlikely. Here's hoping that we'll at least see VC2 and VC3 ported to Steam."
10/10 dont underestimate the power of vegetables
"Valkyria Chronicles is a tactical turn based RPG with real time movement and aiming, set in an alternate reality Europe during the second world war (or second Europan war as it is known in game). You play a militia squad of a small country attempting to protect your people from the the greed of two superpowers. That being said the game world has its own history and politics with only thematic links to reality. One such link is the inclusion of concentration camps, a dark topic which contrasts with cheesier, anime trope ridden, writing. There were multiple moments when I would cringe at the behaviour of these grown adult soldiers, but this did little to take away from my overall enjoyment of the game. What the story does that is most important is set up unique tactical scenarios where strategies from previous battles will not be useful. The levels are presented episodically so you are free to return to any level you have already completed. The game is linear, with occasional side missions being the only exception. Your squad is fully customizable, allowing you to select what class units you want, select their weapon, and to chose among a variety of characters with their own traits. The one disappointment I had was that I did not feel quite as connected with my squad members as I thought I would have. The focus of the character building is on a set of core characters, with the side characters getting their back story told through text that you unlock on a personnel page. I was, however, able to assign them roles and play to their strength in the battles. Outside of the battles you have the option to upgrade your units and equipment, though initially the equipment progression is linear. During battles you can play cautiously, but you are rewarded for completing missions quickly, pushing you to take risks.  All in all this is an absolutely fantastic game. I strongly recommend it."
"Really good port of a really good game.   Got this game when i got my PS3. I ignored it for about a year because it didnt really interest me, but once I started playing i knew i was missing out. It puts a nice twist on tactics based games. Once you select a unit, instead of moving them on the overhead map and attacking, you actually control the character in 3rd person view and can interact with the environment. When you are in the stage enemies can attack you instead of standing there letting you run past. If you are familiar with xcom the attacking system is a little different. Instead of rolling the dice you have a crosshair that you can move to different parts of the body. On human troops headshots do extream damage and on tanks they have radiators, which allows light infantry units to damage to damage the tank.  The story is eh, but the artstyle is great. Every character has personalitys or 'Potentials' that can make or break a battle. Some units gets a defence boost when under fire, while one outright refuses to attack due to being a pacifist. If units are next to each other, there is a chance they will shoot with you when you fire, allows you to make some devastating combo attacks.  Difficulty wise, it can be a roller coaster. On chapter 7 for example, you fight a very difficult and rather long mission, while chapter 6 and 8 can be rather easy, though the difficulty kinda levels out near the end of the game. Despite this, the game requires little to no grinding, which is a plus in my book. You can go the entire game without beating a single skirmish or extra mission.  Once you beat the game you can start again in New Game+, which allows you to keep all levels and equipment, which means you can absolutly destroy the missions you once had trouble with, and along with that, you unlock an extra difficulty on skirmishes.  All in all, its a great game. Is it for everyone? Of course not, its a strategy game with an anime-esq artstyle."
The first time I played this game the 'oh crap it's a stuiped port' hit me right in the face. Didn't even make to 30 min before I deleted. Then over time I keep seeing this game on lots of top 10 videos. I said to my self well lets see what everyone is talking about. I'm very happy I did. Once I got used to the controls I was expose to one of the greatest story and gameplay I've encouter in long time. Only bad thing is the wash and repeat for money or to level. 9/10
"Squad 7, move out!"
"Xcom + Cliches + Anime = Valkyria Chronicles. 10/10 No fluffy tails = 2/10 Scouts OP = 7/10 Rosie's Singing = 5/10 No Waifu material = 2/10 War + Destruction + Magical Death Machines = 10/10 That one gay guy = :D/10 Ending implies some serious bone-ing = 69/10  Conclusion? 8/10 No fluffy tails. PS: You'll know Rosie when you see her, the game kinda announces it. Gay Dude is the best dude 10/ C==3."
"A brilliant gem from Sega that reinvited the SRPG genre. Brilliantly stylist graphic, addictive gameplay, engaging characters and brilliant voice acting from both English caste and the original star studded Japanese VA.  Highly recommended for all lovers of SRPG, Anime and good strategy game in general."
"If you like both anime and xcom, than you will probably have an o-rgasm playing this. But even if you just like strategy turn-based combat games, you can't miss this title. It's pretty unique in his genre, both artistically and gameplay wise, so you should give it a try - especially on sale. That said, expect cheesy dialogues and strange narrative choices. Story is overall good, but it is presented in an anime-way that may not appeal everybody (myself included). Also, the game features great music tracks."
"Super fun strategy game with an excellent plot! I highly suggest checking it out if you haven't yet; the game is not the type you can just blaze through. Valkyria Chronicles takes a buttload of planning and patience which are not my strongsuits in games LOL. BUT its still very very fun, especially when things go according to plan. At times it can be rage inducing tho!! So far the story has been amazing and a bit emotional which I love in a game. Def a 10/10 and a worthy addition to anyone's library"
"I never write reviews, but I feel strongly enough about this game that I feel I need to.  Valkyria Chronicles is not a terrible game. I hesitate to even call it a bad game. In many ways, it's promising. The first six or seven missions are quite fun, moderately challenging, and really seemed to be setting the game up to be great.  However, around the eighth mission, the game really takes a dive in quality. It begins to introduce 'gimmicks' to levels, such as supertanks that can't be damaged until a cinematic happens, an immortal Valkyrie that can move around the map and one-shot your units, mortars that target random areas and force you to waste movement points to get out of their way, and armored cars that move around a city block.  The gimmicks themselves aren't bad. Advance Wars, for instance, was a franchise that had a lot of them. Huge cannons, giant lasers, tank-devouring blobs, etc., and yet managed to make them quite fun. In many ways, in fact, this game reminds me of the Advance Wars model.  The key difference is that in Advance Wars, it was easy to see how the gimmicks worked. You could easily view the range of the giant cannons or the movement speed of super-tanks. Here, that's not an option. The only way to learn about how the gimmicks work is to experience them firsthand, since there is no way to see their range, movement, or how they operate. As a result, there's no way to fairly deal with these threats without repeating a level a few times or savescumming constantly. If you're like me, and hate cheesing your way through levels, you're forced to replay a level multiple times just to see how the gimmick responds to each new move of yours (Oh, you didn't realize that the turn after the Valkyrie appears, she'd be able to attack all your units except the ones that were hiding behind your tank or the enemy's supertank? Hope you saved at the right turn with your single save slot!).  Honestly, it's very disappointing. The first few missions were quite fun, and I really tried to press on once I started getting to the gimmicks, but ultimately, I can't recommend this game, even if you can get it really cheap. It doesn't reward skill. It just rewards savescumming."
"As a person that does not watch anime or has never played any Japanese RPGs, this game struck me as an awesome looking WW2 game with a Japanese twist. I was rather sceptical about purchasing it because I did not want it to be like the horrendous Girls und Panzer anime based on WW2 and World of Tanks. However, I can honestly say this game is AWESOME!  It ticks so much boxes in all the right places. The graphics has a nice cartoony yet pretty feel to it, gameplay is smooth and stable, and the story (which people have criticized) is actually pretty good!  The story is simple. In an alternate planet, in the continent of Europa (which is obviously Europe) consists of two superpowers, the autocratic Empire and the Atlantic Federation. After a resource known as Ragnite (which powers everything) goes scarce, the Empire invades the neighbouring peaceful nation of Gallia to take their Ragnite reserves.  The story is viewed from the perspective of Welkin, a nature-loving nerd who is caught up in the Empire's invasion of Gallia. There, he meets Alicia, a baker who took up arms to defend her town from the Empire long enough for its citizens to evacuate. The story telling in this game is sublime, and I found myself sucked straight into it after the first 10 minutes.   After some mumbo jumbo Alicia and Welkin are drafted into the Gallian Army. This is where the game properly begins. For those who've played Xcom: Enemy Unknown, this is exactly like it. You have your HUB where you can recruit and train soldiers for your squad. There are a lot of different squad members you can choose, and each one has different voices and their own stories which I find pretty awesome. There are some characters you get attached to, like the homosexual Lancer named Jann (who is voiced by the same guy who voiced Jake in Adventure Time.) There is also a R&amp;D department where you can buy upgrades for your weapons and tanks.   That's the story out of the way. Basically, this is the anime version of Xcom but with WW2 themes. Each round you can choose where to position who (there are five classes of units) and battle. To move a unit, you have to use one Command Point. Unlike Xcom, upon selecting a unit to move, you take full control of them from a third person perspective, allowing you to run around, explore the map and fire at the enemies at your will. This is the same with tanks.  As the game progresses, the challenge increases.   However, there are many moments where you will just think 'WHAT THE HELL KIND OF BS IS THAT!' This game is brutal when it comes to the missions. You've made so much progress in a mission, and then you fail all because of an absolutely STUPID trickshot that blows up the Edelweiss. *cough cough GIANT OP TANK cough cough* I've had many rage moments where I just slam on my keyboard in anger and alt+F4 the game in rage. Pretty much every mission was like that. Have one or two game overs that end in rage, and then have a stunning victory. Be prepared for it.  On that note, one of the things that I did not find enjoyable is that the game can become extremely difficult (such as the second mission.) These particular missions you have no choice but to use the method the game expects you to, not using your own strategy against the enemy. I found this a real problem in an otherwise perfect game. Especially with boss battles (I hate the boss fights in this game.)   I really wish that one was able to choose their own strategy and use it against the enemy. While some missions do present this ability where there are multiple ways of winning (be it spamming scouts and doing a hard/fast approach, or go in guns blazing with the Edelweiss and a buttload of Lancers and shock troopers) it still isn't perfect. Due to the lack of variation in enemy types, and the linearity of the levels, there isn't a whole lot of Supreme Commander stye strategy going on here. Not to mention that the A.I can be a bit too smart sometimes. There is also a grading system that grades you on how well you beat the mission. However to attain a perfect score you must 100% of the time do the super scout approach.   This is a good game. If you like turn-based strategy games like Xcom, this is the game for you. If you're a casual player (which is highly unlikely since Xcom isn't a casual game,) then don't go for it, and watch the anime (read below) instead.  EDIT: I discovered the existance of a 'Valkyria Chronicles anime' that is practically scene by scene anime of the game but with some minor story differences. It's not brilliant, but it's a hell of a lot better than *shudders* Girls und Panzer.  EXTRA REVIEW!: Valkyria Chronicles Anime (SPOILERS AHEAD)  At the time of this review I am seven episodes in, and there is not much I can say really except for the differences in character for some people, namely um... ALICIA, WELKIN AND FALDIO! To add more drama into the show the makers added some sort of love triangle, so now Alicia doesn't know if she wants the W or the F. Speaking of Alicia, she's a total B*TCH in the anime. In the game, she's very caring and you can see she has a thing for Welkin from the start. In the anime however, she constantly yells at him, calling him a 'weirdo.' Well, you kinda would agree with her because Welkin is really weird in the anime, he constantly seems really oblivious to the situation around him, never serious as if he has a cloud in his head instead of a brain. I love the scene where Irene threatens to tell everyone he tried to ♥♥♥♥ her if he doesn't give her an interview and he starts laughing innocently as if she just told a funny joke.  Faldio acts like a charismatic lady's man, but the way the writers wrote him makes him look like a generic 'jock.' He automatically starts gunning for Alicia and tries to win her heart by doing stupid things, such as telling everybody they saw each other naked (Alicia caught him shirtless and flipped her sh*t, and Faldio snuck up on her putting up her washing on a clothes line and picked up some of her underwear, and again she flipped her sh*t.) and then used Greek history to compare them to Aphrodite and Ares.  The other characters are pretty much the same. Jann is still the awesome homosexual guy (except that he isn't voiced by John DiMaggio. Seriously, they should have made him deliver his lines in Japanese.) There are also some other characters such as Faldio's sargeant, but they aren't really that memorable. Also, they made Maximillian seem like such a boring villain. In the game he sees everything with a hint of boredom, and isn't afraid of showing his wrath when needed. In the anime, he's bored pretty much all of the time.   That's really all I have to say about the anime. If you're a big fan of VC, then have a go at watching it. I think it has remained loyal to the essence of the game, but does attempt to deviate (which is not a bad thing!) They tried their best."
"Six years after the original debut, there is still no real successor or alternative to this title on the big screen (only PSP sequels). It is still a very good game and very much enjoyable if you are its intended audience and understand what the game is about, but it does show some age. The assets were made for 720p TV and it looks considerably dated today. The port makes almost no attempt to accommodate PC interfaces, resulting in a confused mess of Tab, F, Enter and Space Bar and delays when navigating the menus. Even the story feels old (even though it was a fine piece back in 2008) as today's games and anime have evolved into ones with better storytelling techniques.  Still, VC1 remains an excellent title. There is great gameplay for those who understand what it is and an enjoyable story for the open-minded who don't categorically hate anime. The steam release is made even better with the inclusion of all extra content formerly DLCs, such as Edy's Detachment or expert skirmishes, all for this bargain price. And yes, it includes the Japanese voice option just as the PS3 version did.  If you count yourself as an enthusiast of turn-based strategy, you cannot pass this one up."
"I searched for this for many months for my ps3, no one in holland had it for a decent price. I have never played it until today and I have to say, it meets every expectation I had for it - especially being a port! Very happy with this purchase, which is rare now adays with every tom ♥♥♥♥ and harry releasing the crap they let go in the toilet the night before. GET THIS if you love Turn based strat."
"Fun game that ease you into the story nicely, difficulty pretty fair  Till you reach to B*LLCRAP threesome with 3 tanks in a wide desert and got your *ss kicked hard!  10/10 would suffer again."
"I have mixed feelings about Valkyria Chronicles. By one side, I really loved this game, I obviously would not spend 36 hours of my free time to play a game I do not like. By other side... there are too many aspects I could not accept, in general I was disappointed and not impressed. Well, I will try to explain.  Best parts of the game are setting and lore. It developed brilliantly, Valkyria Chronicles is not just another fairy-tale about 'good and bad guys'. It is a tour through a fictional but very realistic world that has its own history and its own problems, like economical and political issues or cultural acceptance of national minorities. There is a lot of attention to small details, well, just look at this glossary, where you can find a lot of various information, from historical facts to weight of anti-tank gun. Look at these maps, where each street has its own name. For example, did you noticed that one of the streets of Bruhl is named in honor of general Gunther, father of our protagonist? Look at biographies of characters, not only major characters but every insignificant infantryman in our squad has its own small story. All this, taken together, creates a magical atmosphere and immersion. I believed in Valkyria Chronicles, I delved in this game and I loved it, but...  ...but then, I was faced with characters that inhabit this world, and I felt myself, well... cheated. Problem is, I just can not believe in storyline of Valkyria Chronicles. It filled with obvious cliche, like 'war is bad, friendship is good and, despite everything, life is going on'. Most situations looks frankly false for me. I guess, story was designed by people, who know nothing about army, relationships and discipline. Watching countless cutscenes, too often I was not sure, should I laugh or cry. My point is... I do not demand realism in game about magical girls called 'Valkyrias', but if game pretends to talk about serious issues - such as patriotism, xenophobia, humane attitude to enemies and eternal question 'do end justifies the means?' et cetera - I expect that these issues will be highlighted properly. I could not understand, what this storyline actually is... is it a bad comedy or slobbery drama or something else, I do not know. Lack of a good story was especially disappointing for me if compared with brilliantly developed setting, so huge is this contrast.  I do not believe in protagonists. A funny thing is that it was easier for me to believe in personalities of antagonists - commanders of imperial army - who are not stereotypical villains 'lets destroy the world because we can', but people with their understanding of situation and their reasons to fight. I even feel slight sympathy for antagonists like Jaeger and Selvaria. And for ending... I am trying to not use memes, but in this particular situation, I simply can not find another word but 'facepalm'. Just facepalm. This ending is terrible, a classic 'deus ex machina' in its worst shape. *sigh*  Well, this was my opinion about storyline. As for gameplay, I have very mixed feelings too. Combat system is quite interesting and promising, but also it has a lot of flaws. It is absolutely imbalanced, to be short: in most missions you will need only one scout to win the battle, and all other units are useless. To be fair, there is a couple of situations where you will need to use tank or shocktrooper, but in most cases all you need is a scout (obviously, this will be Alicia) and several useful spells (they called 'orders'). Lancers? What lancers? Engineers? Never seen a single one on the field. Tank? Clumsy piece of ma... well, metal.   AI is terrible. It tends to run in circles like headless chicken and often skips turns without any reason. Of course, flaws of AI are compensated with large numbers of enemies but, surely, quantity will not help the imperial army to stand against unbeatable Alicia.  Surprisingly, despite everything, battles was interesting and enjoyable for me. Well, this is my opinion: Valkyria Chronicles is not a strategic or tactical game. It is a puzzle game. The goal is to end missions in less possible count of turns, and suddenly I found that it is quite challenging. I replayed battles again and again, trying to solve this puzzles, and I enjoyed this, even despite all this annoying 'evades and misses'. Even bosses can be defeated in one or two turns, and doing so gave me a nice feeling of completion.  Last but not least. Game looks gorgeous, I absolutely loved this art-style. Characters looks attractive, landscapes are beautiful, Alicia is cute and Selvaria has huge ch... well, charisma. Eye candy.  So. I can cautiously recommend this game. If you can push yourself through countless silly cutscenes and accept weird combat system, then you probably will love Valkyria Chronicles. Actually, there is some good fun, buried under a thick layer of husk. In fact, there is only one thing that makes me sad... I am absolutely sure that setting of Valkyria Chronicles deserves much better story.  And, well... if it is one of the best japanese games then I hope that I will never see their worst. Valkyria Chronicles might be decent, but consider it as masterpiece? No, not even close."
"I had my doubts before I played it since I got it out of humble bundle but this game is great. You really do grow attached to your squad. Each character has traits for personality, whenever good or bad but all of them contribute to your squad's strengths and weaknesses.    The storyline is actually pretty good as the game paints the inglorious picture of war and the music is fine enough not to be annoying to listen to which is a rarity because I usually mute game music. Graphically, this game looks fantastic compared to other games, and this one is a port to boot! The voice acting for the JPN ver is passionately done right while it's so-so for the ENG ver. The mechanics are simple enough to enjoy while being challenging enough to have you fight hordes of enemies by tactic. One complain I have about the mechanics however, is that grade is essentially how fast you do a mission rather than how much of the enemy is destroyed. I have to blitzkrieg most missions to get the A rating within three turns otherwise it's a bust and reloaded save.    A lot of love was put into this game and that is very apparent with the amount of flavor text and world building it provides. I honestly would have paid full price for this game for how much I enjoyed it. SEGA did a great job, I'm for once not disapointed!"
This game quickly came to be among my favourites. It combines a fantastic story with likeable characters and great gameplay. Really liked the merge between 3rd person shooter and strategy games   10/10
"I had the hardest time whether to get this game for the pc or ps3 since i'm an rpg player and like to collect rpg/good games and I dont consider digital copies to count. All I can say is that, I had no regrets buying this for the PC. This is a good game for all you people that don't know. Its fairly challenging imo and i'm only on like chapter 10 at this time of writing this. Alot of trial and error and you probably still wont get a good score w/o using guides. Good story so far, no realllly dispisable characters, good stratagy game, decent music, funky controls in the beginning but I got used to it (really bad tank controls though imo lol). All in all, a really good rpg game that's definitely worth picking up on steam even if you don't play RPGs!"
"Wonderful experience for anyone who enjoys turn-based combat and doesn't mind anime. Amazing PC port, although havng a controller helps nonetheless. The only problem i've noticed is that setting FPS cap to 60 instead of 30 makes the game go twice as slow. Completely. Menu and everything."
"Since I've only started playing, I won't presume to know enough about the game to give you a full review, but I do have a couple of impressions already. The first of which, is that the game looks cool and interesting. Graphics aren't too impressive, but aren't bad either. Voice acting is solid.  As for the story and game mechanics I still can't say much, except that the story looks like it has a lot of potential, and the battles are quite difficult, to say the least. I consider myself a reasonably experienced Strategy/RPG gamer, yet I find the battles in this game very challenging. Actually, 'very challenging' is an understatement too. I guess I should have used the word 'frustrating' instead, but since I've only just started, I'm giving the game the benefit of the doubt and assuming it simply has a somewhat steep learning curve. :)  Anyway, I'll keep you people posted with new impressions as I play, hopefully to make this post worthy to be considered a full review eventually. :)"
"Valkyria Chronicles is easily one of the most amazing titles to be developed during the PS3/360/Wii console generation, if not one of the best games ever to be created. Absolutely gorgeous visuals (which, let me assure you, remain completely amazing in this port and those concerned with FPS or Resolution will have 0 complaints), a beautiful soundtrack, incredibly innovative and well developped gameplay, and a cast of characters and story you absolutely will come to love.  I can't recommend this game hard enough."
"Great game. Great port. Great everything. Sony sheds a tear as they lose yet another exclusive.  Hope we get the sequel ported after this, maybe with the multiplayer moved to Steamworks instead of AdHocParty? That or VC3 localization would be nice.  Get this game."
Join your waifu on an epic quest to fight Nazis and defeat racism. 10/10 it's ok
Great turn base rpg for people that enjoy advance wars and fire emblem with a third person twist.
"If you have played Valkyria Chronicles before like I have, then you do not really need another reason to go ahead and buy this game as you should already own it.  IF , on the off-chance you have never played this game or, dare I even contemplate this, heard of Valkyria Chronicles then you should continue reading on for reasons why you should!  The art style is by far the first and most noticeable thing of this game. To sum it up quickly, it's beautiful and does nothing but enhance the games characters and story. Then you have the story itself, from beginning to end it is one of the better stories I have played in any form of RPG for a fair amount of time, with many an unexpected twist to be had during the course of it. The story is chaptered, with small episodes playing out as you progress through the book that you use through the course of the game. The book is also the main hub of the game, the usual subcommands and also allowing you to flick back through any episodes you want to watch again if you so wish.  The battles are turn based but the amount of thought you sometimes need to make sure you can get those pesky A ranks later on is more than definitely required as even one wrong move will get one of your valuable units killed, and who really wants that now hmm? Treat the units carefully and yes, you may get a lower rank in battle but you can always go back and play them again for more experience. Each turn, you have a set amount of movements which is counted by CP. Each time you want to attack you use one CP to move into position before attacking although you could also be running, or flanking, or hiding away depending on how your battle is fairing. There are also skills in Battle which may consume CP aswell but have a strong effect on your Units. Some battles may also have what is referred to as 'Aces', special enemies that give extra rewards for defeating them such as weapons and tank upgrades.  After battle, you gain Experience, Money and sometimes loot used to help you in your fight against The Empire. The usual upgrades to both class and equipment exist, making sure that grinding although for the most part not necessary, is still a great way to keep all your units topped up and raring to go!   The port itself is rather well done, nothing is lost from the PS3 to the PC as expected and unlike other 'certain ports' that shall not be named, has some configuration for Resolution and the like.  The main selling point as a returning player was, every DLC being included and creating the complete package. So all those extra challenge missions I was personally unable to complete back on original release I can now go ahead and do so.  Hopefully this helps a little with your decision to purchase it, it really is one of the must-owns that was on the PS3 and works just as well on the PC whether you use Keyboard &amp; Mouse or go with a Controller."
"Oh SEGA, now you have noticed how the PC Master Race cherishes such masterpieces, like this one, with GREAT value. Anyone who likes any strategy role playing games is STRONGLY recommended to get this game, or at least have a look on how this game shaped up to be one of the BEST games of 2008.  The port is well optimized for PC play, though bugs and crashes do exist. Hopely that will be patched out later.  Now we await for the next port(s) or surprises, SEGA.   Don't let us down."
"It's freaking Valkyria Chronicles, one of the best games ever released on the PS3 and one of the best games released in the 00's period.  Ported competently to the PC.  Just buy it like 3 times to pay the full price that it deserves.  Shortlist: Remappable controls! Arbitrary resolutions! Whatever framerate you think is THE BEST EVER Saving literally happens at the blink of an eye! Load times are PUNY An EXTREMELY distinctive and unique custom render engine! Memorable main cast and equally memorable side-cast! All DLC from PS3 included for free! An extremely fun spin on the turn-based tactical RPG genre that no other game has really recaptured since. Brutal and extremely mean mission rating system."
"Loved this Game on PS3, can't wait to play it again. Anyone that likes Strategy RPG's and never had a chance to try this game needs to play it. Great story, characters, and interesting gameplay. Totally a must play game."
"Square-Enix, this is how you do a proper Japanese console port. Step it up SeNpai. 10/10 Based Sega. PS: Can you now give us Vanquish and Bayonetta pls"
"One of my favorite PS3 games is now on PC.  Pros: +Well optimized port +Includes previously released DLCs +Now at &gt;60 fps and 1080p and higher +Stylized graphics, memorable music and satisfying gameplay +Likable characters, every unit being unique helps a lot +Story is OK. May be a bit too Animeish for some peoples tastes  Cons: -Pre-rendered cutscenes are 720p -Is it me or are the In-battle character voices a bit hard to hear? -This game is not for you if you can't stand the Anime style and can't overlook it for the gameplay  I hope to see the sequels on the PC as well. I'm also hoping for more good ports and HD re-releases from SEGA. Games like Vanquish, Skies of Arcaidia, JSRF and Shenmue would be great."

"Valkyria Chronicles is a 3rd person strategy shooter set in an world inspired by WW2. Fans of XCOM or fire emblem should find themselves at home with the gameplay. It's a relatively light hearted war story with a focus on the main characters. The cell-shaded graphics stand the test of time and PC optimization is solid. I loved this game to bits and so glad Sega brought it over to PC. Also there are waifus.    Longer Version Optimization  Valkyria Chronicles is a PS3 port, and they did an great job with the mouse and keyboard transition. The game supports higher resolution and fps than the original, although cutscenes are still PS3 quality. The default mouse sensitivity is a bit low for my tastes, so you might want to bump it up to 100 in configurations. No crashes on my end  Gameplay  Valkyria Chronicles is a turn based strategy-third person shooter hybrid. Think a fusion of XCOM and Fire Emblem. In the game the player are given command points (CP) for each turn in a overview map. Moving a unit takes up CP and will turn the game into a 3rd person shooter. In 3rd person the characters are given an action points (AP) bar, which depletes with each step a character makes.   The objectives for missions vary, but most of the time it requires capturing a enemy base, and player is encouraged with more XP and money to win with fewer turns. Permadeath is in place for any non-essential characters, so protect your waifus/husbando. I should mention that you have a couple of turns to tag fallen waifus before permadeath occurs.   Your soldiers are all given a background and perks unique to their background. The leveling and upgrade tree are class dependent so no need to train individuals. Note: There is a almost gamebreaking strategy by the end of game, but there is a rather large difficultly spike in the middle story.  Story  The game is set in a mixture of WWI and WW2, and your fighting for a neutral country caught in up in a larger conflict. Some of the stories and character rely on anime tropes, so if you absolutely hate that stuff you probably won't like the game. Ultimately the game is more about the characters and their reactions to the war than the actual conflict itself. I played on the PS3 and thought it was a humanistic stories slewn with optimism for a better future. By the end of the game I also connected with at least a few of the characters. (I'm being vague to prevent spoilers) This is also one of the few games that touch on racism in a mature way, so major props."
"Valkyria Chronicles blends WW2-style tactical role-playing game style with a pleasant pastel-like ascetic that still manages to look more than serviceable many years after the game’s release. That being said, this is a pretty target-audience game, with a lot of focus on character development and relationships. Rather than being overbearing (like many other SRPGs), creating such a memorable group with unique (if sometimes rather one-dimensional) personalities ties in well with the gameplay itself; you pick and choose certain companions for different terrain/locations/enemy types.  The gameplay itself is where the game shines: think of a tabletop RPG like Warhammer, for the tactics element (you move characters on a map), side-by-side with RPG elements (you gain experience, buffs, members), and minimal shooter elements (you shoot manually — sort of).  It is, overall, a great game. If you never picked this up on release because of the console barrier, I highly recommend you try it now. "
"First off the port is pretty good and Sega has been working on fixing all the issues that has come up. Secondly the game itself is very good. I enjoyed the story, and the gameplay is extremely unique. Its very rare to find a JRPG that has a decent story, great gameplay and a decent soundtrack, but this is one of them. I hope to see the other two games of the series come to steam."

Note: There is a almost gamebreaking strategy by the end of game, but there is a rather large difficultly spike in the middle story.  Story  The game is set in a mixture of WWI and WW2, and your fighting for a neutral country caught in up in a larger conflict. Some of the stories and character rely on anime tropes, so if you absolutely hate that stuff you probably won't like the game. Ultimately the game is more about the characters and their reactions to the war than the actual conflict itself. I played on the PS3 and thought it was a humanistic stories slewn with optimism for a better future. By the end of the game I also connected with at least a few of the characters. (I'm being vague to prevent spoilers) This is also one of the few games that touch on racism in a mature way, so major props."
"Valkyria Chronicles blends WW2-style tactical role-playing game style with a pleasant pastel-like ascetic that still manages to look more than serviceable many years after the game’s release. That being said, this is a pretty target-audience game, with a lot of focus on character development and relationships. Rather than being overbearing (like many other SRPGs), creating such a memorable group with unique (if sometimes rather one-dimensional) personalities ties in well with the gameplay itself; you pick and choose certain companions for different terrain/locations/enemy types.  The gameplay itself is where the game shines: think of a tabletop RPG like Warhammer, for the tactics element (you move characters on a map), side-by-side with RPG elements (you gain experience, buffs, members), and minimal shooter elements (you shoot manually — sort of).  It is, overall, a great game. If you never picked this up on release because of the console barrier, I highly recommend you try it now. "
"First off the port is pretty good and Sega has been working on fixing all the issues that has come up. Secondly the game itself is very good. I enjoyed the story, and the gameplay is extremely unique. Its very rare to find a JRPG that has a decent story, great gameplay and a decent soundtrack, but this is one of them. I hope to see the other two games of the series come to steam."
"Port's good. What else do I need to say. It probably runs fine on your grandma's DOS computer that she's had for decades. I did notice that sometimes the voice lines are a little bit quiet compared to the music, but that can be fixed easily."
"It's freaking Valkyria Chronicles, one of the best games ever released on the PS3 and one of the best games released in the 00's period.  Ported competently to the PC.  Just buy it like 3 times to pay the full price that it deserves.  Shortlist: Remappable controls! Arbitrary resolutions! Whatever framerate you think is THE BEST EVER Saving literally happens at the blink of an eye! Load times are PUNY An EXTREMELY distinctive and unique custom render engine! Memorable main cast and equally memorable side-cast! All DLC from PS3 included for free! An extremely fun spin on the turn-based tactical RPG genre that no other game has really recaptured since. Brutal and extremely mean mission rating system."
"Loved this Game on PS3, can't wait to play it again. Anyone that likes Strategy RPG's and never had a chance to try this game needs to play it. Great story, characters, and interesting gameplay. Totally a must play game."
"Square-Enix, this is how you do a proper Japanese console port. Step it up SeNpai. 10/10 Based Sega. PS: Can you now give us Vanquish and Bayonetta pls"
"One of my favorite PS3 games is now on PC.  Pros: +Well optimized port +Includes previously released DLCs +Now at &gt;60 fps and 1080p and higher +Stylized graphics, memorable music and satisfying gameplay +Likable characters, every unit being unique helps a lot +Story is OK. May be a bit too Animeish for some peoples tastes  Cons: -Pre-rendered cutscenes are 720p -Is it me or are the In-battle character voices a bit hard to hear? -This game is not for you if you can't stand the Anime style and can't overlook it for the gameplay  I hope to see the sequels on the PC as well. I'm also hoping for more good ports and HD re-releases from SEGA. Games like Vanquish, Skies of Arcaidia, JSRF and Shenmue would be great."
"The biggest Surprise for me for sure in terms of Games! Best turned based strategy i have played since xcom enemy unknown came out, the battle are long, hard and epic. Huge amount of customization options and different scenarios to keep your strategic brain on top of things. No moment to be bored in this game. Of course there is some cheesy japanese flair thrown in there.. but who cares.. i love chessy! LOL! Anyways, i have to say this is how a strategy game should be made, the voice acting is amazing and the storyline is pretty good and very original. I Hope there is a sequel to this.. i would pre buy it! If there is any game i would say this is a must buy for any turn based fan! :)"
"an excellent port! played this masterpiece earlier back on the PS3 early days with a native 720P resolution. a cult favorite, and a very underrated game.  what you get from this port: - 1080P support up to 4k display - all DLC which you cannot get when you play way back on the PS3 at that time (except if you live in europe) - custom map keyboard and controller support - japanese voice with english subtitles option - runs smooth at a refresh rate frame or locked at 30 fps settings - achievement system which is exclusively made for this PC port - steam trading card support  overall a really good port that has a lot of options the original PS3 doesnt have!  and if you like tactic/action strategy + a very deep story i suggest you get this gem!"
"release what i tought it will be 1 hour in the morning turnout to be afternoon launch : YAY  i always hype this most artistic tactical game to be ported for PC from the PS3 ver couple year ago :D to be truth, im also SenVal ( Senjou no Valkyria ( the Valkyria Chronicles title in japan ) ) fans , but since i dont had the console, i has to play with its sequel and the third one ( the third one still played on my PSV :D )  i love the CANVAS graphic quality, its SUPERB BEAUTIFUL!! TL;DR  the BLITZ tactic, it always good to be experienced with this, and in my opinion, still good gameplay mechanics :D  the AUDIO / SOUND , it has good voice and sound effect in the game, even you can choose between Japanese or English for Voice Language / Dubber, and of course, i immedietly choose for the original 'voice ' :D  kinda minus at kinda locked at 30 FPS or 60 FPS, and kinda stutter and cinematic scene, but not when IN GAME seession, its run smooth like tanks run at flat asphal on road! :D  for the control. . its. . kinda awkward when using the Mouse and Keyboard, just need to be used to the control there and there, and you will rule the battlefield like you wanted :D  in my opinion as this title Fans, i reccomended to buy this one for PC, especially that for the . . . group. . of ppl who. . cant afford. . . to . . . buy the . . . . .console, but ITS OKAY!! you can still got the fun playing this awesome title game on your PC!!!!  ( ^&gt;^) b !!!!  and for those who already had the game, its not guilty to buy it at PC, and feel the power of accuracy using the Mouse scroll for aiming !!!! &gt;:3"
"You haven`t played VC jet, but love strategy-games like the Fire Emblem Saga or CODE NAME S.T.E.A.M.? Try it out, borough it at your Videostore or something, this is not something that you should miss!  ______________________________________________________________  Valkyria Chronicle is a roundbased stradegy Game (like Fire Emblem and such of the japanese Fraction) but replacing the 'Chessfield' with a free moveble field and the ability to aim at the target yourself. (Like in CODE NAME S.T.E.A.M.)  It has an very good Story shown half in beautifull cutscenes, half Pictures and text, fully dubed in englisch/japanese wich was adabted as an anime in Japan, due to its popularity.   Even though the Story is great, the Gameplay never leaks fun too, the option to replay maps got me spend a lot more hours that i had to without getting bored! And even without redoing maps for better scores / money / ep the Story has hours of playing through only the Mainstory maps - wich are getting more difficult thoughout the story and can somewhat really challenge you, espessially if you made a mistake! (a pluspoint for me, its a strategygame afterall^^) ____________________________________________________________  the best point in VC for me is, that i love the story and the gameplay in such extend that i cant decide if i`m sad or happy when the scenes are over and the map starts / the map is over and the cutscenes start. Its so hard! I want to play to see more, but i want so see more to get to the next map! &gt;-&lt;  I personaly love the Fire Emblem saga and looked for YEARS for something that could reach its throne in my heart.  And i found it someday: Valkyria Chronicle.While these Games are easiely said diffentent, they are somewhat the same too, so i HIGHLY RECOMEND IT for Fire Emblem fans that missed these!"
"Valkyria Chronicles holds a special place in my heart. I would throw all of my bananas at it. Because it deserves all of them and it is shame it didn't enjoy the success it should've gotten back in 2008.  It's essentially an SRPG, JIm, but not as we know it. It looks better, it sounds better, it plays better. Everything about, like letting you take direct control of your troops in a 3rd person shooter style, to having all your troops have distinct personalities, to having death be permanent, to the audiovisual design ... it all feels deliberate. The setting is also novel for the genre, forgoing the typical fantasy for an alternate WOII. It even comes the closest to actually depicting the Holocaust of any game I played, a pretty ballsy move by itself. Ok, there are some anime tropes in the story and characters and not everyone likes those, but that's just one tiny drop in an ocean of awesome.  Add to that a pretty solid pc port, letting you enjoy the watercolor pastel visuals in resplendent 1080p and 60fps, and you've got yourself a game you won't regret buying. I did, twice, and I'll fling poo at any naysayers who disagree.   I rate this game 5 bananas out of 5"
"An excellent and essential strategic JRPG with third person shooter elements. Great art direction, a historic throw back to post-WWI Europe, great soundtrack, 3-Dimensional characters that make you care about keeping your squad alive, continuously increasing difficulty, great sentence fragments and comma spam!  Tag and bag it!"
"I have played half an hour so far and here are my thoughts thus far. I will update if anything changes. Pros: -Great english voiceover (and yes I am VERY picky) - -Unique art style -Combat that mixes 3rd person shooters with strategy based movement -High quality port, but basic -great resolution and Hz Support Cons: -Not a huge array of options, just resolution and Hz along with volume sliders for sound effects and music (no sliders for cutscenes) -The artstyle is hit and miss, can cause pixelization of far away objects -Even though it is turn based if you get in range of an enemy they will fire at you even if it isnt their turn All in all, its a good game and I hope SEGA ports more great titles. Please port some other great games, such as: Bayonetta, Hastune Miku: Project Diva, Sakura Wars, Shenmue, Chu Chu Rocket and others.  Have a nice day :3"
"Valkyria Chronicles 9.5/10  -Captivating storyline with very interesting characters. -Turn based RPG elements are groundbreaking for 2008. -Very challenging gameplay and battle environments.  The only minor issue I had was controlling the tank at times.  Other than that, it is already my 2nd favorite game on Steam. "

"I don't enjoy writing reviews and generally never do.  This game is a masterpiece;  The gameplay, story and art are truly amazing.   The sole negative that I found with this game is that it left me with the want for a sequel that may never come."
I wanna see Cpt.Varrot in swimsuit and it won't let me. sad....  still a very good game. recommend if you like Anime and turn based strategy games
"One of the few good weeb games, and a perfect fit for pc. Valkyria chronicles is what happens when you take advance wars, add a pinch of Final fantasy tactics, and give it Real-time elements.  This port however... it needs improvement. Stuff goes haywire when you set it to 60fps and above, and the game becomes needlessly difficult as a result."
"A fantastic and unique hybrid of real time action and strategy RPG gameplay with a strong memorable cast of characters, interesting world and absolutely gorgeous graphics.   Definitely worth playing.   Note: It is a great port, apart from it acting weird if your frame rate exceeds 60.  Original frame rate on the console was 30 and it can be set to that if you want an authentic experience. It's not a fast paced shooter so this should not have any significant impact on your ability to play."
RIght up there with Fire Emblem in terms of strategy and thinking so that all of your characters dont die horribly. It also has the mandatory anime beach scene 10/10 would take my tank to the beach again
It's like Fire Emblem and XCOM had a baby.
"If you loved Advanced Wars, Final Fantasy Tactics, or even Fire Emblem/Shining Force, you're going to love this game.  It plays like a SRPG you would expect to come out of Japan, but is heavily enlaced with elements of real-time action. You're not forced to stay on a set grid and move so many squares at a time. To me, that freedom is a nice change of pace, and still is even many years later in this port to Steam. You heard me correctly; this game is nearly eight years old, and looks better than ever at 60fps.  It's nice having surprises like this come to pc every now and then, and I fully welcome any console game port to pc that gets optimization as decent as  Valkyria Chronicles .  My only actual complaint is that this game never had any type of head-to-head mode.  Here's hoping Sega will consider giving us high-definition ports of the PSP sequels. I'll be there for that, Sega. I'll be there with a big wad of cash in my hand, and a ♥♥♥♥-eating grin plastered across my face. Until that day arrives... where's  Shenmue ?  Update: Shenmue is on the way :)"
"This was a great WWII simulator. I didn't know Russia (excuse me, The Empire) had giant tanks and magical blue people that can kill your entire team in two turns if your not careful. I also didn't know that people took turns attacking each other during WWII. Overall, a great game!  ...  Wait, this is a fantasy game?"
This game is great! Sega has released it's PS3 eclusive RTS. It's a great game and it is also a great port! Reaching resolutions up to 4k and able to play at 60fps is also a plus. I mean playing 60fps is standard but at least this port does not have any performance issues and the game looks really great! The only downside is that the pre rendered cutscenes are locked at 720P and there aren't that many options when it comes to visual quality but it's still overall great.   The story of the game is really good; if you don't like anything about anime you may not want to pick up this game because the game's length is at least 50% cutscenes/dialog but it isn't bad because it's pretty well written! Overall I really hope Sega decides to port more of their console exclusive games and give them the standard 1080p and higher/60fps and higher treatment.
I love this game on PS3. I love it more on PC.  I love you.

"This game is just something else.  In terms of gameplay and mechanics, it's pretty solid, and its structure overall could be likened to a fusion of Battalion Wars, Tales of Symphonia, and Fire Emblem, with the really good and the really, really r e t a r d e d stirred together like toothpaste and orange juice in a hot mug. By that I mean it has an extremely clichéd, childish, predictably mainstream Chinese cartoon format of storytelling and characterization that isn't even the slightest bit realistic or well-thought out, assigning trope after trope after trope of everything you've both seen before and haven't really looked forward to rolling your eyes at since middle school.   By this I mean that in terms of the way it treats WWII-era modern warfare in both theory and practice and how this applies to realism and storytelling, it's just like Battalion Wars in that it's just plain dorky and mentally r e t a r d e d. In other respects it's like a Tales series JRPG, or a Fire Emblem game, in that it makes extensive use of overused anime character archetypes and plot devices while considering such things as highlighting individual relationships between characters to be far more important than the overarching premise of the game itself. In any normal RPG, this is normal and even expected, but when you apply it to a turn-based, pseudo-RTS, WWII-oriented tactical military strategy game, it comes out looking extremely messy and awkward, to put it in simplest terms. For example, senior military commanders with extremely distinct and flaunty personalities are, at various times, physically at one another's necks when they should be realistically separated by several hundreds or thousands of miles of war fog and various logistical sensitivities, and each time they either try to duke it out  face à face  like kings did during the era of Bronze Age chariot warfare, or they just talk for a while, go their separate ways to 'take it outside', and then throw their huge, disposable armies of nameless human pawns at each other until the loser publicly admits defeat and runs away. Meanwhile, your snipers make use of only very light cover and more or less taunt and flail about whenever they pick off some poor ♥♥♥♥er on the enemy's side from just 75 feet away; in real life this would guarantee that his hiding spot would be compromised and his head would get blown the ♥♥♥♥ off by countersniper fire or something else within 3 seconds, but yeah this is just a game and it's super anime so screw all that.   Bottom line, if you like your tactical wargames super realistic and no-nonsense logical, you might just hate this game and drop it before you get past the third level. If you can overlook the frivolous and typically shounen animu arrangement of it all (or if, for whatever reason, that's what you're actually  looking  for), then you should be able to take the time to appreciate what a fantastic job Valkyria Chronicles does in making up for all of its faults, with its addictive and challenging, balanced gameplay, semi-innovative mechanics, and  Go -oriented rather than  Chess -oriented approach to low-intensity tactical warfare. It's entirely possible you will either love it or utterly despise it as a result of its various pros and cons, but it's still by all means worth giving a shot if you've found it in any way intriguing from my review."
"The game is a nice mix between the Winter War and the Invasion of Belgium, put in a somewhar likeable mechanic. The storyline is likeable, though filled with those nice cancerous anime tropes that will make you cringe, but that is balanced by somewhat likeable characters and good gameplay, which doesn't get stale.  My only personal gripe with this game is with the Valkyria's. If this was a simple anime war game, made in the style of Talvisota, I'd love it to hell. But NO, we need a magical girl with a oversized Panzerfaust!"

Playing this game will speak for itself. Highest recommendation possible.
The game is so good that it convinced me to spend something like 100 bucks on an anime statue
The greatest jrpg (subjectively) since lost odyssey ... maybe the last i ever let comsume me.
solid 10/10 im not a weaboo
"Highly addictive tactical first person gameplay, engaging characters you grow to care about and a great visual anime like story that displays as the game progresses - what more could you possibly want from a computer game? Its not often these days that I play a game from beginning to end, but such was the case with this game. I invested over 90+ hours of game play into this one. I have been computer gaming since the 1970s and played many hundreds of computer games and this game is one of the very, very few that has really impressed me - and that is truly saying something! Trust me - you will love this game! Highly recommended!"
A good turn based strat game with RPG elements
"I played one of the VC on my psp, and was shocked to find out after all this year I can still play similar game. It gives me nostalgia and happiness."
"This game is amazing, it quickly stole my heart and climbed the ranks to being one of my favorite games. The gameplay runs at a smooth 60fps the whole time and it also controls really well for a port. The movement controls of the tank are the only thing that is a bit tough to learn but once you have those down the game is smooth sailing. Story, voice acting, and visuals all come together to make the game a masterpiece in my eyes."
"Read this if you a) hate anime; and b) love turn based strategy.   That describes me when I was thinking about buying this on the PS3. I am very, very glad I bought this game then, and I was happy to buy it again on Steam.   If you love anime...well, you wouldn't be reading this, then, unless you wanted to argue with me about how I am an idiot for not liking anime. Just move on, because I'm sure you have some cutscenes to watch.   If you're like me, though, I do have to warn you that the cutscenes in this game - of which there are MANY - are anime as hell. I don't even need to go into it, though, because I am pleased to report that you can skip any of them - or all of them, if you want - if you get tired of watching Welkin and Alicia blush with embarrassment just from talking about bread with each other, or listening to the winged pig squad mascot have an 'oink oink' conversation with squad characters, or just generally annoyed by the anime of it all in general. So, skipping cutscenes = awesome.   The gameplay is GREAT. I wouldn't say the game is hard. It starts out very easy, but gets a very nice level of difficulty going for itself later on. The game is also fairly long. I've replayed the game a bunch of times on the PS3, and you really do get the feeling that you like playing it even after beating it two or three times. There are also the typical 'skirmish' missions that allow you to gain EXP and credits outside of the stroy missions, and they are fun, BUT there are only ten different maps for skirmish. There are varying difficulty levels, but to be honest they all feel the same except for the 'EX Hard' mode. The real disappointing thing about all of them, though, is that your ranking for each map is mostly based on the number of turns you take to complete the objective, usually capturing the enemy 'base' (walking up to a flag and hitting a button). Every map can be beaten in either one turn or maybe two turns, and so once you figure a map out for that rating, there's no real challenge even on the hardest difficulty.   But, that's really only a minor complaint. Figuring out how to get that one-turn victory is fun in and of itself, so it's not really a negative other than the limited replayability aspect. There's enough gameplay here to make up for it.   The game looks great. The art style is really neat, and really just looks amazing during play. The different classes and vehicles have a really nice rock/paper/scissors distinction going, and upgrading equipment, vehicles, and squad levels is not complicated - you can't really screw it up. The down side of this is that there's not a great deal of choice for you to agonize over. The real strategy for you is deciding how many and what type of classes you choose to field for any map rather than which squad members - most of them (except for the 'main' characters, which may or may not be required for a given map) are interchangeable. Also, you can actually switch squad members out during the play of any map and bring in other squad members to replace them.   The best thing about this gameplay system, though, is that you get to field enough squad members on any given map that you can deal with the enemies on the field in the way you want to deal with them. You can have a lot of really effective squad compositions, and it is neat to try out the levels in a bunch of different ways. Also, certain characters have affinities or dislikes for certain other characters, or may have different attributes trigger under a given set of circumstances that happen in game. These come in the form of both buffs and debuffs, and do really add to the variety. Some of them, particularly affinity-based buffs and debuffs, are really very amusing, and you find yourself laughing your ♥♥♥ off at the way some squad member reacts whenever his secret crush is around. It's well worth finding out all the good ones.   Yeah, I do highly reccommend this game. The gameplay really is a blast: it's not Xcom hard, but it's got a decent enough level of challenge, and the missions get big enough that you do have to spend time figuring out how to exploit the enemy. If you do like turn-based strategy, this game does it WELL, and you'll probably like it quite a bit."
Fun game! Many hours of game play! It Reminds me of mgs portal ops.  I love and hate the perma-death of the soliders. Had to restart once due to one of my favorite characters dying. Each match can last up to 10(speed run) 15 (good player) or 20 minutes ( Normal player) and maybe more.   Game is rather long and so I recommend buying the psp ver.  (I Dont know the difference between the steam ver and psp ver.) 
"Short version: Best $5 I've ever spent.  Long version: 12 hours into the game, and I'm loving every second. Haven't felt this way since I played Fire Emblem for the first time on Gamecube.  The unique combat system, engaging narrative, and immersive atmosphere really make this game stand out.   The combat is essentially the kind of turn based RPG you might be familiar with from games like Fire Emblem, but actions are played-out real-time, with the other units on the map getting 'attacks of opportunity' a la D&amp;D. Difficult to describe, but that's the best way I can put it, and if offers a very unique and challenging experience.  The narrative and characters are filled to the brim with anime and RPG cliches, as well as real-life streotypes. The game seems to all but acknowledge this, without breaking the fourth wall, so its easy to not only ignore, but enjoy. There were moments, however, where the game's dramatic tension was dulled by the predictability of certain cliches. I, however, like to think I'm pretty scrutinizing when it comes to narratives, so perhaps this won't bother many people. And if you're not familiar with anime and RPG cliches, this shouldn't bother you at all, as the narrative is otherwise very good!  The atmosphere really complements the game. Behind all the light-looking, cutesy anime figures, is a very serious backdrop of a nation suffering from conflict. Being only 12 hours into the game, it feels like this seriousness could be played-up a bit more. Through all the info that Gallia is suffering from the war, the player seems to only rarely see the devastating effects of war first hand, and it works counter to the comentary about wanting to stop the war and bring about peace: if war means being able to kick ♥♥♥ and be a hero all the time, who cares about peace?  Again, I'm cynical when it comes to narrative, so this probably won't bother you.  There are a few other very nice touches about the game. The glossaries detailing the histories of characters, statistics and fluff info on weapons, in-game news reports about the war, the intricate cutscenes involving the main characters, the fun of customizing your troops gear and skill level. They all add icing on the cake!  Overall, this game is a work of love, and it shows. I'd buy it again!"
"An amazingly well done port. The art style is gorgeous and the characters are loveable. Also, you can choose Japanese voice acting with English Subtitles. What more could you ask from a JRPG/Strategy game in a fictional WW2 universe. I thoroughly recommend it to any turn based players out there."
PS3 Classic. Happy to rebuy the PC release. Lets hope they do the other 2 as well.
"Absolutely great game, great story and great blend of tactical view + third person view. Valkyria Chronicles boasts a gorgeous art style with tons of unique, interesting characters for you to build Squad 7 out of. Between the compelling story, great controls and ultimately rewarding gameplay, this game is highly recommended to strategists and JRPG'ers alike.  9/10 gets an enthusiastic hoof up."
"Before this, I played the sequels on PSP. Great TRPG and nice tactical elements. It does feel dated but what do expect from a PS3 port? Dialogue and story is cheesy, but we're all here for the gameplay, and this game delivers well. Would recommend for weebs and casuals who can overcome the cringe of playing a weebgame in return for innovative gameplay...that's been out for a few years...  THANKS, FISH.  "
"This game is must own for RPG fans. I finished this game back when I got it on PS3 and loved it so much that it became my favorite strategy RPG ever. I believe that this game could have had a bigger following with proper advertising as a lot of people (including me) had to take a shot in the dark when looking at this title not knowing what type of game it could be. Any game that can put you to tears just by finishing the game and watching the intro movie is an amazing game in my eyes. Soundtrack is amazing, story is amazing, characters are amazing, and most importantly, the gameplay is amazing.  Hopefully Sega will release the others on steam as well, however I don't want a rushed port. If they don't then I hope they at least continue the franchise as I would love to play more of this game series and pay some hard earned money to buy them if they do.  As ports go, this port is really well done. As others have stated the cutscenes are PS3 graphics, but they are in no way bad, however everything else is 60 fps for me so far. If you are looking for a great game to spend your money on, this is a sure fire bet to have a good time with. If you enjoy it too you should tell others about it because they might love it too."
"I already own this game on PS3, but I bought it again for PC. Why? Because it's easily one of my top 5 favorite games of all time. Fantastic, strategic gameplay. Great replayability. Good story. Loveable characters. Challenges are pleasantly difficult. And the added achievements are icing on the cake. This is one of the few games I have that I am dead-set on 100% completing all the achievements.  This is a surprisingly well-done port. Supports 1080p resolution which actually does make the game look even better (though cutscenes are all still in 720p, BUT still look good). Controller support. There'll probably end up being mods and post-process injectors to make this game look even better than it already does. Aiming with the mouse is SO nice for precision shots, something that was often difficult on PS3 because of how much the curser moved with the analog sticks.  You OWE it to yourself to get this game."
"Despite a few hiccups, this is solid turn-based RPG with a neat setting. I hope they make a sequel that hammers out the flaws, some day.  S-some day..."
I'm so glad SEGA brought this game to the PC. It's one of those tittles you don't appreciate till you actually start playing it. The game mechanics are refreshing with its mix of turn based and real time. And the story and character development are in a league of its own. If you haven't play this game you are doing a disservice to yourself... get it now!
"This game is a blast to play! It's such a blast as you would literally stick your head in a tank's cannon. The story and presentation are marvelous and the gameplay is simple but demanding. So far the port runs smoothly and the only problem I have is the unaccurate controls on my 360 controller while shooting. Luckily the game pauses when you take an action other than moving.  For everyone who like's JRPGs and Turn Based Tactics, this is a must buy!"
"I bought a PS3 just for Valkyria Chronicles back in 2009. To this day it remains one of my favorite games and it's always a pleasure to return to it for another playthrough. I was more than esthatic when I heard Sega would bring it to PC and that it would take advantage of its capabilities to push the game to 1080/60fps and beyond. The story and characters are fun and immersive, the gameplay is spectacular, and the artstyle and sound are perfect. I would recommend this game to both new players and those that have already played it. It's just that good."
"The best game I have played this year.  I have always wanted to play this game to see what all the fuss is about but I don't have a ps3 so trying it out myself was kind of off-limits. Thus I was very happy to see that after 6 years, Sega finally decided to release the game on pc, and I was even happier to see that they actually put some effort into this port. I'm not going to pretend that it's perfect, as it has some pretty obvious, though very minor flaws. So far I have managed to enjoy this game fully without even having to bother plugging in a controller, as the keyboard and mouse controls feel very fluent, which in my experience is very rare for console ports. This pc version is definitely one of the better ports out there.  The game itself is also excellent. Turn-based combat mixed with a bit of action is definitely a hit. So is the story of the game, which is told in either well made animation or little conversations between characters that remind me of skits from Tales of -series.  Valkyria Chronicles has so far been the most fun I've had with a video game since Fire Emblem: Awakening. And that's saying a lot, as I've had a blast with Dark Souls-series and some other great games I've played this year. For the low price of 20€, you definitely shouldn't miss out on this gem."
"VC is a tactical military sim with a lot of anime influence. You play as a division within the Gallian military during an invasion of your homeland by the Empire, who has invaded your country for your plentiful Ragnite supplies. If you want to know more about the story, get the game :P (or read a review with spoliers in it).  The mechanics of this game are such that it requires tactical thinking before moving your soliders. Enemies will fire at you at will while you ar ein their line of sight and can kill you quickly if you dilly dally too much in action mode. A quick way to deal with this is to plan your targets and move locations ahead of time and only change your plans if surpises arise (like hidden units that you have traveled passed or new enemy units that have your move location clearly within their los) and then enter fire mode asap or end the current action turn asap.  Every unit has strengths and weaknesses, for example scouts are a very fragile unit but can move the furthest and have the largest sight range. On the other hand tanks take two CP per turn but are resistant to everything except lancers and other tanks (especially if you get hit in the weak spot).  If you plan to run around out of cover for most of a mission, you are going to fail it end of story. Move from cover to cover and plan your attacks based on weaknesses and strengths and there are very few situations that you will not be able to handle if your units are leveled enough.  This version on Steam also has all of the DLC for the game so there is extra content that you may not have on your PS3 version as well as the Japanese voice overs. Do yourself a favor, as well, and either use or buy a controller. The control scheme, while doable on k&amp;m, is tens of times more suited to a controller.  You are even able to replay missions as you go forward and have stronger units so for those of you, like me, that like to find a more simple or quicker stratagey can experiment to your heart's content. You will even get exp and dct to use for upgrading your equipment and units from replaying missions.  I really can think of no negatives in this game other than that the configuration menu is a separate exe file, like many other Steam games (SPAZ for example). I don't consider it a negative though.  This game, on its own, gets a 9/10 from me. I will knock of half a point (8.5/10 for the PC port as without V-Sync and frame limiting there is massive screen tearing and there are a few graphics glitches in crossfire/sli).  I have this game on PS3 as well and have sunk hundreds of hours into it. Not much is too different between the PC port and the console version. Though there is one particularly nasty bug:  When you go to the headquarters for the first time, do not do stuff at the training grounds and R&amp;D Facility. Instead just go there and get the basic run down and then leave. Once you have visted these and the other two areas, leave the HQ and then save and re-enter. If you do anything at the R&amp;D or Training Grounds the game will crash upon attempting to return to Book Mode.  This is the only major bug I know of so far though I am a paltry 9 hours into the game (on Chapter 4).  If you like tactical games like FFT, Breath of Fire, or Growlanser then you will like this game."
"I won't say the same thing that every else is listing the contents of the game. It's an amazing game and the port from the PS3 is almost perfect. For Gallian veterans, this game is no a brainer. Not only to be able to replay and reminisence but to also support the series and show Sega that this gem is not forgotten. To one day hopefully see a new entry in the series for all of us to enjoy. For newcomers, this is a game you should definitely play if you have always been a fan of strategy RPG's. Sharing many traits from games like Fire Emblem, Shining Force, and possible Final Fantasy Tactics while giving itself its own concepts to make it even more unique. It's definitely a pretty hefty game and will take you at least 30-40hours to complete the first time around. That time doens't include the DLC and New game+, in an effort to completely 100% this game. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do and for Sega for release VC3 to the West already ^^' #ThankYouSega"
I have already beaten this game 4 times on the PS3 and as a JRPG fantatic I must say this game is fantastic. The alternate WWII setting is very creative and I overall love it. The stories war and political tone is creative in the JRPG realm and is definetly welcome as I do enjoy its tone. The gameplay was revolutionary for the time as this is a strategy RPG that lets you take direct control of your units as you lead them to battle. The game of course takes strategy and patience to get through but the overall feel of the gameplay is natural and fluid and you will fall in love with its battle system. Overall I would say pick up the PC version of this wonderful game. The PC version is worth it because it includes all the DLC including the one where you play as best girl Selvaria. So yeah this game is worth every penny and $20 is a steal for this masterpiece. So do yourself a favor and buy this incredible game
"Sega is well known for making PC ports so awful your eyes fall out of your skull and creep into the deepest, darkest, depths of your basement, leaving a puddle of tears in their wake. So it is with great happiness, when I say that Sega has made a very good port here. Controller support, V-Sync, great resolution options, the whole shabang. The only thing lacking here portwise is the inability to use the mouse in the menu screens, which you will quickly get used to; the other problem is that cutscene quality is not changed from the PS3 version, fortunately the unique artstyle makes the game look rather nice even during those. Now as for the game itself, it's a turnbased tactical thirdperson shooter hybrid and boy does it work well. Move your soldiers about one at a time with your limited pool of command points, which are higher depending on your unit selection as some units provide cp bonuses when on the field. This game features permadeath for soldiers in your company who are not main characters, and each of these character has certain traits and a small bit of backstory to make their death oh so sad. I would recommend that any strategy fan pick up this game because there is nothing else quite like on the market, and this is something that you should definitely experience."
"Alright time to break it down. Valkyria Chronicles. Originally PS3. Back then when we had no trophies. Now on Steam, it includes the DLC. You heard me right. Edy's and Selvaria's Dlc in the Extras Menu. For those who haven't played it buy it here, you get the whole thing.   Now onto review. A masterpiece. 10/10 Hardcore fan. Was so into it when I was younger. This game took me by storm and revisited the days when the ps3 first came out and you are literally playing a wonderful story that has familiar elements of description depicted in WWII and WWI. However the game itself has you take the grand role of Welkin. Now I must state this games mechanics was unique. There was ways to upgrade, replay areas for cash(Yes farming for your upgrades and seeing characters lines and actions). The people have unique bios and personalities. There are some interesting facts and cross overs. You have a Tank (I'm not complaining). The characters have their own coming of nature throughout the story. The side quests delve more into it as well as the bio from taking them into battle and having the reporter cover it. You play this game, you won't regret it!  GALIA TO ARMS! (Spoilers ahead)   The feels of Isara...  The singing... Your characters can die. There is Skies of Arcadia Vyse and Aika as well as Fiona (Medic) The bios are funny... same with lines Your tank is your friend UPGRADE Shocktroopers best cover fire Scouts and Snipers best shooters Lancers don't you dare miss Engineers Repair and grenade. Shots mediocre.  Interesting side notes and cutscenes Welkin has a fan club, same with Alicia apparently I don't care if Darcsen, they are fine as hell!  Now that the small stuff is out of the way.  The characters. Yes all of them have a unique story. The theme is befitting of the story and game. The plot is very well done and will play you out for some. One of the best things is that I can say about this game is that back then not everyone knew and when they finally did spread about it, oh man was I one of the few that had the hard copy. Still proud and never gonna forget playing this game and the memories. Now I'm playing here for old times sake. Ah I must admit though, the frames do matter when viewing, some computers don't handle it well. Know your settings people."
"Really fun game. Haven't noticed any bugs. Since the aesthetic style is the way it is, it will probably age quite well too.  Additionally, it's great news that the licensing worked out for the Japanese voice acting. I found that I didn't really like the characterisation in the English scripts as much, so I'm happy that I can just turn the subtitles off and change the audio."
"Played it before on PS3, then played it again when it's released on Steam, still loved it!  Story : If you're a fan of anime types of storyline then this games delivers it really well. Even though the background story is about war and opression (also include some racism), this game delivers it in a way that's not too dark, and makes you want to cheer for the characters in the story. Further along the game you might even sympathize with some of the antagonists once you know their background story.  Gameplay : The gem of this game. Even though it claims itself as a tactical RPG, it's actually a bit more than that. The freedom of movement in your action and the various methods you can do to complete a mission is what makes this game shines. Even the skirmish missions, which is essentially missions for grinding, can still be fun when you experiments with different completion methods. Though sometimes you will get frustated wishing for that one extra Command Points. :P  Characters : A LOT of characters, each with their own quirks which often will make you chuckle, or sometimes grind your teeth in frustration. Ex : those characters who sometimes forgot to reload their gun, too bothered to move, etc  Art : I think I'll simplify it by saying that this game was once praised as one of the RPG with the best art on the console version. Fair warning though, not sure if it's my PC or the game itself, but the there seems to be jagged edges on some of the textures especially when playing cutscenes. Not really that noticeable though.  Porting Quality : A lot of games which were ported from console to Steam usually suffers from inadequate porting issues which causes a lot of bugs etc. What surprises me is the porting quality of Valkyria Chronicles is really good. Tens of hours into the game and I haven't encountered any problems yet. A big plus.  Extras : The Steam version comes with all the DLC and also original Japanese voice for the game. Might be a plus for some people.  Conclusion : A must have game if you're a fan on anime style storylines, fun tactical gameplay, and pretty art to look at."
"Game is amazing, a great port from to the PC."
"This game is the combination of World War 2, Fire Emblem and most 3rd person shooters. It was also originally a PS3 game. Before that deters you, this port nowhere near as bad as AC Unity, Black Flag or Watch Dogs. This is a very good port of the game. POSITIVES: -Strategy Game, bad decisions result in consequences. -You are unable to tank through the game, it requires some thought, not recklessly charging at the opponent. -Framerate lock set to monitor RR, no 30 FPS lock, no resolution lock either, adjustable resolution -Tanks -Good Cutscenes -Good Story NEGATIVES: -None OVERALL 10/10-Worth every penny. This is a quality game, and I loved every minute of playing it."
this game has actual PC settings.
"Awesome porting compare to others Game Publisher nowsaday...No FPS and Resolution lock...Awesome Loading speed... For you who guys interested previously but can't play due to PS3 exclusive...GET IT NOW!  Edit: Forgot to add, All DLCs Included! Like GoTY Edition!  I urge you to buy this game, if you have a little interesting in it, not just for the game itself, but also support SEGA for the effort in awesome porting.  TL;DR: -Awesome Porting -60 FPS on released. (AP drains faster bug in 60 FPS, but fixed within 2 days. GJ SEGA) -Loading Speed major increase comapre to PS3, even without using SSD -All DLCs INCLUDED! (LOOK at you CXPCOM and KXEI.) -Cheap price -Did i mentioned awesome porting?"
"Surprise! The best tactical rpg for ps3 from 2008 is now on PC!! If you haven't played it yet, do yourself a favor and experience this gem."
"If you didn't have a chance to play this on the PS3, now's your chance to play one of the best JRPG and tactical games around. If you like Freedom FIghters or XCOM you'll really like this game.  It's anime-lite instead of full anime, the main character is an educated college man instead of a dumb teenager. "
"Valkyria Chronicles was easily one of the best PS3 games out there, and this port does it justice.  A game with a fantastic aesthetic and even better gameplay - A huge cast of diverse and interesting characters, and a solid plot. A full AAA unique TRPG for $20.  Seriously, what's not to like? Stop reading reviews and play it, already."
"One of the best games I've played on PS3 is now on PC! Valkyria Chronicles is a touching story involving a group of normal people who are thrown into war, fighting for the town they grew up in and the life they left behind. I really enjoyed my time with these characters and cannot wait to revisit their world with even more definition and smoothness than I experienced in the past.   The port is quite solid, featuring resolution options, dual audio, rebindable keys and even includes all the DLC missions. This certainly makes it feel like quite a bargain even 6 years later, and with a 30hr+ campaign I think it is. Some may need to tweak the PC controls to get them to their liking but I found them more than sufficient out the box, since the option to rebind is there though I don't think this could be seen as a fault at all.  PC elitists will be happy to hear that 4k with downsampling runs incredibly well with the GeDoSaTo mod, so much so that v-sync will probably still be necessary to help limit those frames. If I had one complaint though it would be that the pre-rendered scenes are still at native PS3 720p which is upscaled to your resolution, though I don't think that it's ugly in the least. In fact, thanks to the art style, I think this game stands up well against the test of time and is bound to become a classic on PC in the years to come."
"Played the ps3 version with all the dlc, and I loved every second of it. This game is an under rated gem that NEEDS to be played. Buy it and ensure we get more stuff like this!!!     Selvaria best girl, would waifu/10   "
"This game is like the love child of XCOM EU and Fire Emblem Awakening... if those titles had come before this one's original release, at least. If you like strategy games, ANY kind of strategy games, I guarantee you'll like it. The story is all right, with the translation and dub being kind of wonky as expected of a 2008 japanese game, but it's average at worst. SEGA did an overall nice job with this port, with the game lacking a bit on graphic settings but still, crazy resolutions at 60 fps support is there for those of you with good computers, and the game is decently optimized.   The gameplay is pretty unique for a turn based strategy game, the real time elements are pretty damn well integrated and the missions maps are very well designed, made to be approached with strategy without forcing you into a set ideal tactic. I recommend this game to both fans of strategy games and fans of japanese games, and really, to anyone that is looking for a really good game at a really good price."
"Controller support: Perfect Mouse/Keyboard: Only use mouse to fine tune aim Graphics: Videos in PS3 quality, game renders fairly well with PC (not perfectly scaled) Music/Audio: Great. Japanese/English voices Story: Helll yess. and with DLC and achievements  Edit Feb 9/2015: Completed 100% - 10/10 game, there are not many games like this on steam. Basically is what Codename S.T.E.A.M wants to be."
'Like Fire Emblem with guns' - Machinima
"I always wanted to play this game from the first time I saw footage of the PS3 version so you can imagine my joy when it was announced and subsequently released for Steam! Very nice all-around! Perfect match for people like me that like japanese strategy RPG like Fire Emblem, FFT, and Tactics Ogre.  + sweet art style and graphics engine + gameplay that remains fun and engaging and makes you think strategically + very interesting fictional universe (lots of parallels with World War 2)  + charming cast of characters. you WILL like quite of a few of them + good sountrack  - game story starts great but gets crappy and predictable aproximately halfways - shallow main villian with anticlimatic battle - you can break the game by exploiting a specific character class (not telling)"
"Great game. If you are into anime and tactical games - highly recommended. Good story, interesting characters, pleasant graphics. A bit clunky controls will take some time getting used to. Overall, a decent console port of a good game. Got some replayability too, well worth it's price."
"A really solid game which effectively balances RPG and strategy elements; I enjoyed every minute of it. Other reviews will do a much better job in describing the customization and solid mechanics the game offers so that won't be the focus of my review.   What really stood out for me is how the game isn't afraid to bring out the more uglier human elements, such as racism, war brutality and hatred. For example, a common theme in the game is the dehumanization of Darcsens, an ethnic group with jet black hair who are reviled, ridiculed and mostly treated as subhuman by in-game society. Having played so many war games which simply pits the generic 'good guys' Us vs. the 'bad guys' them, it is refreshing to see how the characters, friends and foes, aren't cleanly defined but and each have their own strengths and weaknesses plus personalities which make them unique and memorable. Seeing the characters with their flaws and prejudices fight together and ultimately learn to appreciate and respect one another in a non cheesy way is a sign of great character development and is one of the shining features of the game.   Ultimately however, I really love how despite all the struggles that are felt by the characters in game, the developers always provide a message that there is always hope, no matter how desperate and miserable things may be. While the dubbing at some points are cringe inducing, if you love a fantastic story, RPG and Strategy, give this game a try, you won't be disappointed."
"One of the finest games of the seventh generation finally released to the PC, it's a brilliant game. With a great story and characters to boot. Highly recommended. It is one of my favourite games of my entire Steam Library alone.  PS: You can save during battles, just an FYI. I was kicking myself when I found out I could do that when I was over half-way through the game."
"Good story, have a really... REALLY lots of cutscenes. It's more like you are watching an anime than actually playing it. If you love anime, this game is really enjoyable to follow.   they got a freaking bonus episode (aka: fan-service) in there. the funny thing is, you need to buy this bonus/extra chapter (with ingame currency). and this one special chapter cost a whole lots more than the other episodes. The first time I saw it, I was like. WTF.. why suddenly this extra chapter cost a fortune. But it was damn worth it       Story:"
"Good game!  I would highly recomend it, its a butifull strategygame with a good story.  The port how ever is NOT as good, expect only the bare minimal from this port. Would recomend playing with controler."
One of the best game series ever made so glad to see it made it on pc now too. Please buy this game show sega that people love it and maybe 3 will finally reach the States and Europe. 
"If you played this game on PS3... why are you reading this?! You already know how great this game is! This review is for everyone that hasn't heard of VC or is still on the fence about it. First off, don't be dismissive of the reviews; this game was VERY well received by critics and rightly so. That it underperformed commercially (and why you may never have heard of it) is due to matters that I'll save for the end (in case you don't care). Financially this is a great value: you get the game (which still sells for 40+$US for a used PS3 copy) and all the DLC (another 20+$US on the PS Store) included. This adds extra difficulties, new skirmish modes and additional bits of story.  Mechanically, VC is a strategy game in line with typical turn-based tactical games. You take a turn, then the enemy goes. Repeat until you win or the bad guys do. That is about where the similarities end. In practice, you control your troops in a third-person view, directing them freely on the battlefield. There are no grids here. Each character gets an action and movement, to be performed in any order you choose. Movement drains an action bar, so you can use as much or as little movement as you want, take an action and then move again if you want. All of this combines to make the fight feel much more fluid than in typical TBT games. To ice that cake you've got leveling, R&amp;D, active and passive skills and 'Orders' that basically act as global spells or super powers in other similar games. Taken together, it is a refreshing and interesting take on TBT fare. Most importantly, it all WORKS. Unlike many systems that try to redefine this genre, BliTz engine actually performs as intended.  Visually, the original game was (and still is) impressive. The aesthetic ties directly into the story, as it's a recounting of events as viewed by a war correspondant. The game begins with a book opening and the author telling their story. To that end every bit of the world and interface is designed to reinforce the idea that this is literally a story in motion. And don't worry, the exposition is minimal. Everything here is 'quasi-cel-shaded' and given texture and color like illustrations on paper, and all of this reacts in realtime rather than in still frames. Simple put, the artistic style (in my opinion) is beautiful.  As for the narrative, don't let the visuals fool you: Valkyria Chronicles touches on the costs and darker sides of war. You won't see grizzled scruffy men grunting and barking curses at each other, nor will you see giblets and fountains of blood. In fact, though the implications of the horrors of war are not ignored, the actual violence itself is pretty tame. Likewise, if you see all the bright colors and cartoony art style and think this is going to be child's fare, think again. This is no Advance Wars, folks. Nowhere will you see something like, 'Hey guys, we just destroyed an entire enemy army! Let's go grab a soda!' These are real people in a desperate situation, and the narrative never loses sight of that.  For those that are familiar with it, the team responsible for VC also created Skies of Arcadia for the Dreamcast, and originally intended this game to be a sequel or spiritual successor to it. What they brought to Skies they also brought here: a clear and well defined world, as well as an interwoven story told within it. The entire game is focused on its objective of telling this story and making you love it. No collection missions. No skinning animals. No street races. No grabbing flags or hitting glowing checkpoints. This game is a story, and it only sets out to tell it.  To wrap up, I am a HUGE VC fanboy. I've lost count of the articles I've written and references I've made about getting this franchise on PC. I still insist that the real reason that most of people have never heard of this series is because it launched too early in the PS3's lifespan and then had its sequels shackled to the dying PSP. Now all of that doesn't matter! I'm extremely excited to see this series where I believe it always belonged and truly hope it will find new life and new fans here on The One True Platform (tm)!"
"Wow. It's amazing. Great story, great pacing, fun (but strict) gameplay, and best of all, I can play it on my laptop on the go. Whoever decided to port this to PC should be showered in steam giftcards and given an Edelweiss tank of their own.   If you love Final Fantasy Tactics, Advance Wars, XCOM, or Fire Emblem, buy this. Best $20 you'll ever spend.   11/10"
A pretty good game with interesting visuals and gameplay. 
I mean if you hate fun you don't have to buy this.
"If you're a fan of games that try things different from the genres they find themselves in, and anime, then this game will be a hit for you. I say differently, because the game is not your typical strategy-RPG game. It throws a neat action element into the mix that can be mistaken for action as a focal point, but in practice, the action element actually causes more strategic forethought than you would initially expect. No running in, guns blazing, in this game, or you will likely be quickly mowed down. At least, until you get the hang of things. At the end of the day, though, it's a pleasant experience with an engaging story to tell, a largely excellent vocal cast and localization, and a JRPG on your PC. How can you go wrong?"
Literally the best game on Steam.
"The game is already a classic, I was just worried about the port considering there has been another not-so-good port released recently (I'm looking at you, FFXIII.) It turns out there wasn't anything to worry about, as both the game itself and the port are much better than FFXIII.   Keyboard and Mouse support, button remapping, graphics/resolution options, and all the other makings of a good port. The only downsides appear to be that there is no mouse support in the in-game menus. It's not really a huge deal and the mouse is fully functional when it matters in the game. The other issue my friend and I have both shared is crashing after returning from headquarters for the first time. I'm not sure if it's just coincidence or something causes the crash, but it was incredibly annoying to go back and do things over again because of the lack of an auto-save feature. Remember to save often."
"As of this writing, I have only experienced 7 hours of gameplay. This is an early impression, not a full review. It will not be a comprehensive examination, just my initial thoughts on the game.  First, I will address the matter of the PC port. I have experienced zero issues. Excellent port. There are very minor gripes, none of them game-breaking in my opinion. A good PC port runs well, and has more options for PC users. It does not necessarily have to re-vamp the whole game at a fundamental level. If you absolutely despise console games, you will find a reason to not like this. I'm not a console gamer nor a console game lover, but this one is really a great game that transcends its origins.  I went into this somewhat skeptical. Even after a little research and a few gameplay videos, I was unsure but decided to take the plunge. Let me assure you, I am not at all sorry that I did so.  I absolutely love the world that Valkyria Chronicles takes place in. The art and overall esthetic is beautiful. Voice work is of good quality, and suitable for the genre. If you watched anime when you were a kid, this might very well strike a chord with you.  Playing this game is very much like watching an anime, except that you're involved in the story. There is plenty of story here. You can skip the story and just enjoy the combat scenarios, but you would be missing out on this amazing piece of art. Do yourself a favor and experience what this game has to offer. If you really don't like anime or this type of storytelling, then you might not want to waste your time.  The combat is enjoyable, and there is plenty of depth to be found for those concerned it may be overly simplistic. You are required to think. Thoughtless deployment and thoughtless actions result in failure and death. Synergies between squad members are meaningful. The transition to and from real-time movement within a turn based structure is smooth and works well, but may take some getting used to for a few. Once the flow of an engagement becomes natural, the system shines.  I'm having a lot of fun with this, and I'm glad I bought it. If you're still on the fence, read some more reviews, watch some more videos. I can tell you that this game's cult status is not without reason, and I can now see why it had and has such a devoted following. Definitely a classic.  As always, your experience may differ from mine. I hope some of you find this information helpful.  Happy gaming!"
"Good Story? CHECK! Action-Strategy-RPG? CHECK! Cel shading? CHECK! Different Units? CHECK! Running fine/good port? CHECK! High Resolutions? CHECK! Awesome Game? CHECK! As hard as 'Fire Emblem' NOPE! Does that matter? NO WAY!  Do I recommend this game? HELL YEAH! (I've played this game a few years, ago on my PS3 and I loved it) This port is nicely done and the game is really recommendable! my personal rating? 8,5/10"
"So, where should I start...?  Gameplay-wise, it is a turn-based military strategy with thrid person shooter action. Pretty much like XCOM, but years before that. Everytime you select a unit to move from a top-to-bottom view of the map, you go down into the battlefield and move it yourself in real time. Enemies will shoot at you if they spot you, even though it is your movement turn, meaning that you can be killed if you don't do something fast. This game constantly switches between thoughtful decisions when planning your movement and sheer action when you are actually moving / attacking.  However, Valkyria Chronicles also does a great deal at story-telling, world building and character development. It is some sort of allegory to WWII told from the point of view of some characters whose hometown just got burned down and enlisted into the militia to defend their country (a tiny, neutral nation, sandwitched between two superpowers). You become the C.O. of Regiment 3, Squad 7, and you proceed to pick the soldiers who will aid your quest. May I point out here that each and every one of them are unique and have their own background, personality and oddities, all of which will show up in the battlefield, whether you like it or not. Most of them are not even professional soldiers, but common folks like you that have nowhere left to go and are now stuck with you.  On top of that, the game is long, enjoyable and once you get started, you'll want to see it through the end. It was originally launched for PS3 in 2008 and now it has been ported to PC, improving it in the way here. It also has that good little 'something' all SEGA games have. I can't recommend this game enough.  + As I said, great job at world and character building. + It has to be the best story I have played thorugh in any game ever.

"As of this writing, I have only experienced 7 hours of gameplay. This is an early impression, not a full review. It will not be a comprehensive examination, just my initial thoughts on the game.  First, I will address the matter of the PC port. I have experienced zero issues. Excellent port. There are very minor gripes, none of them game-breaking in my opinion. A good PC port runs well, and has more options for PC users. It does not necessarily have to re-vamp the whole game at a fundamental level. If you absolutely despise console games, you will find a reason to not like this. I'm not a console gamer nor a console game lover, but this one is really a great game that transcends its origins.  I went into this somewhat skeptical. Even after a little research and a few gameplay videos, I was unsure but decided to take the plunge. Let me assure you, I am not at all sorry that I did so.  I absolutely love the world that Valkyria Chronicles takes place in. The art and overall esthetic is beautiful. Voice work is of good quality, and suitable for the genre. If you watched anime when you were a kid, this might very well strike a chord with you.  Playing this game is very much like watching an anime, except that you're involved in the story. There is plenty of story here. You can skip the story and just enjoy the combat scenarios, but you would be missing out on this amazing piece of art. Do yourself a favor and experience what this game has to offer. If you really don't like anime or this type of storytelling, then you might not want to waste your time.  The combat is enjoyable, and there is plenty of depth to be found for those concerned it may be overly simplistic. You are required to think. Thoughtless deployment and thoughtless actions result in failure and death. Synergies between squad members are meaningful. The transition to and from real-time movement within a turn based structure is smooth and works well, but may take some getting used to for a few. Once the flow of an engagement becomes natural, the system shines.  I'm having a lot of fun with this, and I'm glad I bought it. If you're still on the fence, read some more reviews, watch some more videos. I can tell you that this game's cult status is not without reason, and I can now see why it had and has such a devoted following. Definitely a classic.  As always, your experience may differ from mine. I hope some of you find this information helpful.  Happy gaming!"
Never got to play it in PSP. Very good convert. Recommended for RPG lovers
"Anime turn based combat, with deep story *-*"
Literally the best game on Steam.
I haven't really played the PC version yet but I did start it up to check out how well they ported it from the PS3. It is one of my favorite PS3 RPGs and it easily is still one of the best games in general as well. HIgher res and 60fps is also a nice addition to an already stellar RPG.
"The faults: -Scouts are overpowered. -Ranking system favors speed to the exclusion of all else. -Perfect ranks are often at least somewhat dependant on knowing events and soldier positions before the battle starts. -It could stand to be longer, at only about... 40+ missions with the DLC, the game is short by JRPG/SRPG standards. Long compared to anything else. -RNG hates you and wants to see you suffer. Like all other RNG's ever.  That's literally all the flaws of the game. It's beautiful, has a large cast with unique voice acting, great combat mechanics, a good plot, and a very fair learning curve. It avoids pulling its punches, with enemy units often outnumbering and overpowering yours by a very significant margin, even from the early maps, where they'll have multiple tanks, anti-tank soldiers, snipers, and all manner of stuff set up in nasty positions. New Game + is a thing, and opens up extremely hard maps as well.  On the port side of things, it's a solid, proper port. It has its bugs, namely when going to higher FPS counts, but it looks better, runs better, and plays better than its PS3 counterpart."
"This game is superb to say the least , personally i find difficult to describe it , but it for sure would fall under a mix of SRPG and JRPG. In the end it is a mix of shooter/RPG/strategy game.  The port quality is decent/good , the game is ofc old , but SEGA did add plenty of standard features to it , so technically speaking , there is very little to complain about.  Describing this games combat would is a hard thing , i guess to give an quick idea i would say you can select soldiers to send on each battle , you get an overall number of 'actions' per turn and you can spend them on any soldier you got , when you decide to shoot then game gives you a third person shooter camera in which you probably will try to get a headshot. Add to that the fact this is a RPG , so there are different classes that do different things and got different tools.  I recomend watching a video about the combat and how its classes work...  This game really deserves to be recognised has one of the best games that ever launched on PS3."
"So, where should I start...?  Gameplay-wise, it is a turn-based military strategy with thrid person shooter action. Pretty much like XCOM, but years before that. Everytime you select a unit to move from a top-to-bottom view of the map, you go down into the battlefield and move it yourself in real time. Enemies will shoot at you if they spot you, even though it is your movement turn, meaning that you can be killed if you don't do something fast. This game constantly switches between thoughtful decisions when planning your movement and sheer action when you are actually moving / attacking.  However, Valkyria Chronicles also does a great deal at story-telling, world building and character development. It is some sort of allegory to WWII told from the point of view of some characters whose hometown just got burned down and enlisted into the militia to defend their country (a tiny, neutral nation, sandwitched between two superpowers). You become the C.O. of Regiment 3, Squad 7, and you proceed to pick the soldiers who will aid your quest. May I point out here that each and every one of them are unique and have their own background, personality and oddities, all of which will show up in the battlefield, whether you like it or not. Most of them are not even professional soldiers, but common folks like you that have nowhere left to go and are now stuck with you.  On top of that, the game is long, enjoyable and once you get started, you'll want to see it through the end. It was originally launched for PS3 in 2008 and now it has been ported to PC, improving it in the way here. It also has that good little 'something' all SEGA games have. I can't recommend this game enough.  + As I said, great job at world and character building. + It has to be the best story I have played thorugh in any game ever. Some of you may call it 'cheese', and I can't blame you, but when a game makes me laugh non-stop in one sesion and cry like a little girl in the next, I call it a win on the developers' side. + The battle system is pretty unique, if not a little annoying at times. + Not taking the main characters into account, every recruit in the game (who, as stated, are all unique) can be killed in action if you mess up.

"This game took almost 5 years to get released here, on gabenbook, but the wait was worth Loading times are fast No crashes or whatsoever All the DLC included (thanks sega).  In the gameplay zone, it's a turn based military strategy game. The game is really similar to some franchises you know, if anything, is like X-COM, but with more free of movement, and less classes.  You, as a commander, lead a group of soldiers in a fictional europe conflict (REALLY similar to WWI and WWII, it even has stories like some concentration camps and stuff, but I'm not going to spoil anything).  The story is also really good, the characters (mainly only the protagonists, but the side characters gets some attention via the personnel tab) have some serious development trough the game, and some of the war related stories are really touching.  The graphics are nice, and the shaders are beautiful, the art is also pretty good   Also, it's cheap on some Indie stores  Don't miss this gem, negro  p.s.: It also has an ANIME, if you're interested in that.  p.s 2: 4.99 RIGHT NOW, DON'T MISS THIS CHANCE"
"there are 2 ways to play this game 1- use your brain to kill every enemy within strategy and tactics adjusting as the battle go if you play that way, the game is challenging as hell and ♥♥♥♥ing awesome  2- order stack a Alicia the monster scout and rush her in the enemy like a mother♥♥♥♥ing rambo annihilating everything on her patch seriously, dat ♥♥♥♥♥ is a monster  as you might have guessed by what i said the game is really awesome, really challenging and hard but not impossible with the right strategy, making you always be ready for any surprise also the game makes you really like the characters, making you care about then  the problem is that the game is really easy to break like order stacks with alicia, or anyone, mainly scouts they just make anyone a power♥♥♥♥inghouse sometimes when something goes wrong you can just order stack someone and wipe the enemy or if you just wanna rush and end that battle already  pros -awesome characters, even the cannon fodder(you really care about then) -potentials makes every character unique -the game is pretty challenging but not impossible -its a pretty long game, where you can spend hours playing -the story is pretty nice with some really good plot twists -great port, with awesome default controls for the keyboard(i have a gamepad but i stopped using him as i saw that playing with the keyboard and mouse was better)  cons -no character creator(in this game that could be really awesome) -for some reason the volume control doesnt change the volume from the movies =/ (pre rendered videos) -i know the game is old and all but god how awesome would be a multiplayer mode where you can challenge your friends(its not really a cons since its just something i would like and not something that you will miss in the game) -easy to break(break i mean to find a way to turn most of the battles a joke)  anyway for a 6 years old valkyrie still a awesome game that everyone should buy and play all of my yes, really recommended, BUY DAT ♥♥♥♥ NOW"
"I recently bought this game on the deal of the week sale for 9.99, and it's pretty much as good as i expected it to be. I never knew about this game when it came out on PS3 back in 2008, the first time i saw it was when they first added to the Steam store a few months ago in Novmember 2014. I saw the art style (anime) and saw how amazing all the reviews on the store page, so i decided to look up gameplay. The first time i saw Alicia running at 1080P 60 FPS (something the PS3 version does not support) i thought it looked amazing, then i saw a few comments about this game having a great sound track, then i was sold. I would of bought it on the holiday sale, had no money. I'm such a sucker for games with good sound tracks, and this one didn't disappoint. It's pretty good to see Sega pushing out a game like this since i'm a big Sega fan. It goes on sale fairly often, don't buy it for 19.99 (even though it's definitely work 20 bucks easily) just wait till it's 9.99.  - Solid story line - Great sound track - Great graphics - Great gameplay - Solid keyboard and mouse controls (kind of wish you could use the mouse on the main menu though, but space bar being confirm makes up for it though) - Comes with ALL the DLC free that was on the PS3 as far i know (pretty sure it's all of it though)"
Just buy it.....
"Once there was a game called Vakyria Chronicles, It was out on a console and left the PC gamers sad-icle.  Then Sega went on a whim, and Steamed this on a limb,  And it became one of the best PC ports ever-icle."
"Great Art, Great Story. Its the type of game that makes you want to stop playing because you dont want the story to be over. Vyse and Aika are in the game (Skies of Arcadia). A fun fluid tactical game. Its plays like Xcom but every mission is story driven. You will never feel like the missions are repetive. They are all unique."

You owe it to yourself to play this game. 'Nuff said.
"It's an anime game set in World War II. It plays like a mixture of Fire Emblem and Gears of War. That's gotta be worth $20, right?  Good things about this game: -Graphics are stylish and nice -Sound is good, unless you're repeating the same mission again and again, but I'll get to that later -Combat is intuitive (doing stupid things will get your dudes killed most of the time) -it's an anime. This is good if you like anime. -The port is good, but you should be playing with a controller for an optimal experience.  Bad things about this game: -Mission 7 is frustrating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I'm about to spoil it for you. Basically, you personally fight Hitler in North Africa and he's piloting a tank the size of a naval cruiser. When you're about to lay the smackdown on Adolf himself, Rule 63'd Rommel appears with an ancient space laser and kills all of your units, and then you probably get obliterated by a panzershreck. UNLESS, of course, you're replaying the mission for your second, third, or fourth time. By that time you'll know Rommel's on her way; otherwise it's completely out of left field and you'll lose have to repeat the mission. This is fundamentally bad because it ruins the experience. If Rommel had just slaughtered my men in droves but I still won, that would have been fine. But because of the instant-kill factor forcing me to repeat the mission, the whole experience was ruined. At time of writing this review, I've played Valkyria Chronicles for 12 hours, and 2 were spent playing that one same mission. I'm not complaining that the mission was too hard, I'm saying it's just poorly designed and frustrating to basically require the player to have precognition or a strategy guide to clear it on their first try.  -No character development or screentime for anyone aside from the 6 main characters (but then again it is an anime so what did I expect)  -Wonky hitboxes on RPGs make it impossible to hit certain targets from certain angles, which leads to moments where a shot clearly connects but deals no damage. You'll know what I mean when you get to Mission 7.  -Aiming controls take some getting used to. They're clunky, which can get you killed sometimes. Most of the time it's no big deal though.  IN SUMMARY: buy this game. It's fun."

"tl;dr: This is a must have if you're looking for a deep single player experience with an excellent fleshed out story.  what is this?: Valkyria Chronicles is a single-player turn based strategy game that works much in the same way other games do in their genre but with a few twists. Think X-Com but with real characters. It's set in a WWII-esque setting which takes many ques from history in the 2nd World War and other conflicts, any keen history buff can see where the various influences for nations,weapons, vehicles and events come from.   Pros:  *Great storyline, I enjoyed it and I still have a ways to go until i'm finished. (i've watched the anime for this which is mostly similar).  *great combat mechanics, the combat works well and its possible for your squadmates to do well, troops are divided into 4 classes each with their own strengths and weaknesses and require close teamwork in order to be at maximum effectiveness.   *traits and potentials: Each soldier is different, they all have their own stories and personal quirks that make their way into how they perform on the field. For example some soldiers hate each other and their effectiveness can wax and wane based on who's fighting with them, or their preference for a certain environment can help them or hinder them.  *Various RPG elements such as leveling characters, traits and weapons (with them having new added effects).  Cons:  *Difficulty scales up quickly which requires you to at times grind skirmishes.  *Tank controls can be incredibly annoying and has more then once lost me a battle due to how it was ported. However this could just be my own issue.  *Certain plot points can be unsettling with there being frequent references to Racism (against a group known as Darcsens, essentially made to represent the Jewish and other minorities). However for a first serious depiction of the Holocaust and discrimination put on minorities, not only by the antagonists but also the protagonists too makes it somewhat of an eye-opener to the attitudes held across the world at this time.   special notes: This game, which came before the anime differs greatly at times with the Anime, the anime features a lot more drama and added or removed plot points, even going as far as inventing new relationships that did not exist. I personally prefer the game in terms of plot (it all feels warmer and friendlier then the Anime). In terms of plot the Game is (in my opinion) better."
Just finished my first playthrough and the DLC. Very in depth and alot of fun. They don't make em this good that often anymore. Worth the 20
"Lovely anime style, striking similarity to the invasion of Poland, great gameplay, the only problem with this game is its lack of mouse support."

I was going to write something about how this is my new favorite anime series but I guess they actually made an anime series out of it? Satire is hard.
"Story:  In an alternate universe Europe is undergoing WWII due to a lack of a multipurpose energy resource called ragnite. The neutral country Gallia is invaded by the Empire for its rich ragnite resources    or so it seems   . The main characters, Welkin and Alicia, end up leading Squad 7 and take part in various military campaigns. As the war goes on the true motives for the Empire's invasion are revealed.  The story is told through episodes. Some of them you play and some you just watch. It is kind of like an anime and there are even filler episodes you can buy responsibly with your military funds, one of which is the anime required beach episode. You can rewatch episodes but you cannot replay campaigns. The only campaigns you can replay are the bonus skirmishes, most of which resemble the actual campaign you played.  Gameplay:  This is a turn based RPG, however you have full control of your character (a unit of your squad) and can aim with them too. There are 6 classes: Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer, Engineer, Sniper, and Tank Commander. Scouts can move the farthest in one turn and spot enemies more easily than other classes, they have a weak but accurate gun and their defense is low. Shocktroopers can move a low to medium amount in one turn, their defense is good and they can carry a powerful machine gun and flamethrower. Lancers cannot move very far but they are effective against tanks. I believe they can also get a variant of their weapon that makes their lances (rocket launchers) have a wider spread for groups of enemies. Engineers can refill ammo and repair guard towers, sandbags, and tanks. They can heal more effectively too. Snipers cannot move very far and have low defense. In the first half of the game they are pretty much useless because they will ALWAYS miss. Later on you can upgrade your sniper rifle with Aim stat A and they will be pretty useful then. Tank Commanders will always be in their tanks. You will get 2 tanks in the game but in the first half you can only control 1. Tanks can kill other tanks and groups of soldiers and they can break down barricades. You can also use it as a shield for your troops in the back and you get smoke rounds later on.  Although you can aim in this game it does have random elements (RNG). Most enemies will die when you shoot them in the head with a shocktrooper or scout but some will dodge randomly. Lancers and Snipers will frequently miss even on later stages when you have your weapons upgraded. It is not too big of a downer but on the last stage you might have to shoot an armored enemy and they only shot the target 1 out of 4 times. That is 3 turns wasted. Tanks can also shoot armored enemies but they take 2 CP (turns) rather than 1 CP. I said 'might' because there is a chance that the boss won't activate those armored enemies (another random element). On a reload he did not and I was able to finish the boss on that turn.  You level up and purchase upgrades for the entire class rather than individual characters. In my opinion I love that feature because you can play the game without too much fuss. YYour squad members can die but you can save them if you get to them in less than 3 turns, complete the mission or reload a save from before. But you get an achievement the first time one of them dies so I was OK after one of mine died. The princess even gives you an award. Joking aside it was kind of sad when my squad member Coby died because they each have their own story and personality shown by their dialogue and unique abilities. Some characters unique abilities and they like certain people. When they are by a person they like (as a friend or love) they get status up. I believe status up makes them less likely to miss or raises their defense. I am not too sure. The character like system doesn't really get in the way of the game but it would help those that wish to use it. Each class also has certain abilities that are unlocked as you level up in addition to the unique ones. While some unique abilities simply give them a status up others change the gameplay. One unique ability, 'Hard Worker', allows the character to shoot again. Another one allows you to instantly heal. Certain class abilities can increase damage, or allow better tank repairs. There are some bad abilities too. One called 'Moody' prevents you from doing anything on your turn. Some characters are also racist or sexist and will get a status down by the type of person they hate, including Darcsens, women or men.  This is a fun great game and it really is fun planning your moves. The ability to move your character and aim with them is a plus. I only like RPGs if they allow you to control your character in some way, like Mario &amp; Luigi. There is even a New Game Plus. This is definitely a buy."
"Valkyria Chronicles is the bset rpg strategy game you can play, i remember the first time i played i was back in 2010 on ps3 i did beat it of course and after i did i went and watched the anime and both are great i would recommend anyone to play this. this games has a well balance of action, romance and drama, but for people who dont have time to play the game just watch the anime the anime is just as good as the game since the anime still follows the story. i would give this game a solid 10/10 same with the anime."
"Loved this game on ps3. Can't describe how excited i was to find out it was ported to PC. Haven't beaten it on pc yet, but so far, it is an amazingly well done port. Now I just hope they bring over the rest of the series."
"It's been six years since I first played through Valkyria Chronicles on the PS3 and I am pleased to report that the game is just as, if not more stunning on PC then it was when it originally released. If you're on the fence for buying this game because of recent trends in shoddy ports to PC such as Dead Rising 3 and Final Fantasy XIII, I can say without a doubt that you have nothing to fear because Valkyria Chronicles is steller. Do yourself and this masterpiece justice and add it to your Steam library now! You won't regret it."
"Great game, very engaging story and characters, with a unique type of turn based strategy."
"Please note that this recommendation is coming from somebody who usually *deplores* anime, so you can be assured that the gameplay more than makes up for it.  Think AdvanceWars in 3d but with brief 3rd person real-time segments on the battlefield. You can customize abilities and weapons in the true RPG style. It's worth a look if you like military turn-based strategy. In the later levels, you really have to think about your moves. There is A LOT of game for your buck here.  I wrote this review and recommended this game the second after one of the characters in a cutscene unironically used the word 'fisticuffs.' "
Why is it that this game is one of the best game on the PS3 era?  1. It's showcase one of the most beautiful artstyle that blends in Anime Character with Watercolor. 2. Great in-depth (though still have a few parts that can be iron out) Gameplay mechanic that took it's turn into a new RTS with the blend of RPG gameplay. 3. Unique classes that plays their role really well in turns of turning the tide of the battles. 4. Well Crafted level design that plays out onto how to solve certain issues like taking out 'Shocktroopers who's hinding in the sandbag' to 'which units is can be snipe so your troops can push in with low resistance' 5. Rich backstory about the world and the races that plays alongside  Down side though? The Main story is anime-ish. So it may turn down some players who isn't into anime-ish way of story-telling stage.
"Brilliant cinematics, plot and atmosphere. 25+ hours of content. Might have converted me to anime.  However the gameplay is rather hit and miss. Often missions will be almost impossible to win without knowing what will occur or how mechanics will work (I guess it's more realistic that way...). I like to think the main character is a time traveller as I reload constantly.  Though ignoring the odd terrible mission the game is fantastic and you should buy it."
"Game is great and very long.  Doesn't seem to like you taking screenshots, crashes with fraps. I recommend saving all the time."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a PS3 console-port from 2008. I can't make comparisons to the original, since I know nothing about it. The graphics are improved though, as the game supports high resolutions. You can't directly change any other graphical settings, but higher resolutions render the textures and shadow maps in better quality. You can also disable the console limit of 30 FPS to your native refresh rate for a smoother experience.   Controls are working in full gamepad support, as you can expect from a console port, but keyboard/mouse functionality is limited to the game's combat phases where mouse usage gets its debut. Menu navigation is managed strictly by directional buttons. I played it through using a gamepad, because it felt more natural as in how its meant to be played. I only used mouse for a bit of aiming support. That's where mouse is vastly more accurate than a gamepad. But it's not necessary by any means. The game is paused when you take aim. You can take your sweet time fumbling with the analog sticks if that's what you prefer.  The main story is cut in pieces of visual novel -like speeches, pre-rendered cutscenes (which by the way are lower resolution than the rest of the game, probably straight copies of PS3 version) and combat sequences. The story is as cheesy as any moderate anime series. It has the usual characters mental growth, bits of romance, drama and handful of twists and turns in the plot. It has the common manga clichés like a group of teenagers being in control of the world's fate and awakening to superhuman powers (kinda, if you see it that way - I try to not spoil anything). I personally love that stuff. This game is based on a fantasy world - look for reality checks elsewhere. The otaku in me noted the lack of 'fanservice' though. That would be the only minus in my personal taste.  The gameplay mechanics are a real treat to us turn-based/srpg lovers out there. Combat sequences start by positioning your units. You get a set amount of action points each turn that are shared between your units. One action point is used when you select a character to move (or two action points for a tank) and you can attack once before deselecting it. Moving itself is a blend of real-time and turn-based system. Running inside of enemies sight/range, they will fire at you. They stop firing once you stop and take aim to shoot - it works quite well. If you select the same character multiple times during one turn, they are each time more fatigued, resulting in shorter stamina bar which indicates how far you can move.   You can also use your APs to issue 'orders' that you learn with more combat experience. Orders can be things like buffs to your units stats, healing or issuing a mortar attack anywhere in the battlefield. Although there's a decent list of different ones, I found myself hardly ever using them unless I was in a worrying situation. When you end your turn, the un-used action points are transfered to the next turn as a bonus. The enemy count tend to outnumber you the more the further you get, but their AI is, frankly, bad. You can use that to your advantage when planning the battle. The bad AI didn't really bother me. Rather, it balances the odds and helps you predict their next move.  Winning battles award you with money and experience. Money can be used to upgrade your tank(s) and your mercenaries equipment. Experience is used to learn new orders and increase your character classes levels. Your units don't have individual leveling. Upgrading a shocktrooper class for example levels up all of your units in that class, potentially giving them new personal 'traits' such as chance to trigger evasion bonus when under enemy fire or a shot that never misses the target. You can freely change the units you take into the combat. The experience you gain doesn't only affect those you take with you to the fight. They all gain benefits equally. Each character has his/her own 'personality', stats and relationships. Good relationships with another character next to you in a battle makes both of them attack simultaneously when one of them attacks along with other possible bonuses. Bad relationships naturally decrease the peformance.   Before wrapping this up, I should mention about those white cloudy borders you probably notice in all of the screenshots of the game. Yeah, they seem kinda unnecessary and I don't know what it's about. It was a curiosity at first to me - why is my view obscured by odd cloudy borders? During the 3D enviroinment of battle scenes, you can sometimes see manga sketch -like black lines of the background within that stuff. Did I understand it backwards? Perhaps the colored middle section was a result of my imagination when the real game was actually monochrome pages of a manga? When you enter a smokescreen grenade, the whole screen is filled with that stuff and you only see black outlines of everything. Am I seeing something that don't exist? Hmm! ;] Whatever it may be, after short gaming I forgot about it and my eyes started to ignore the white. It's probably just how they want the game to look more dreamy with already pretty canvas-like graphics.  Overall, this game exceeded my expectations. It's fairly easy game, but oddly satisfying and addictive to play. While the story might not be anything to write home about, I will remember this title by its gameplay system. I would recommend it to anyone fond of turn-based war games and anime. I give it five out of five stars. :]"
"I love this game. It brings me back to the days of final fantasy 7 and 8 and mega man legends... playstation days. Even brings me back to my MGS PW or PO fix... or even to the Pokemon days... It's great. Far as I can tell its an alt universe German invasion of France with no luftwafelles. It's even got the little occultish stuff going on. Some romance, idk, haven't really been trying to beast through the story. It's a game that makes XP farming fun, very tactical. The video shows no game play, but it's like a turn based rpg war game done in semi realistic but kid friendly anime art(even though there is people dying all over the place.) Idk, it plays like metal gear acid, just a little less complicated, and a little more kriegspeil. It's really fun, and I am compelled by the story. I'm not sure, but I feel like this game was released on PSP for some reason. It's a lot like final fantasy tactics except it's sorta simplified and complexified in different ways. Just youtube a game play. There are some annoyances. Gamepad design is weird and in menu is oversensitive, but aiming a weapon, it's literally goes the opposite damn way. No it's not an inverse, idk why they did it, it's to allow for more human error. Xcom kinda except you do a lot of the aiming. It's really great tho. Also, another thing thats really kinda annoying... Well, they have their cutscenes which are great, but they have these sub scenes that are just so annoying cause you have to press a button every line. Even when someone says '...' Really kinda annoying buuut I'm looking past it."
"I cant actually explain how, but this game is soo exotic and it turns out to be an excelent WWII RPG xD"
"A surprisingly good strategy game. Don't be put off by the Anime style. Unless you are already into such things. I wasn't, but this game has changed all that.   The interaction between characters is very good. It actually makes you feel attached to the characters, and you will go to lengths that you would not normally consider just to reach someone with a medic.  The depth of story and character development has also led to me going down the rabbit hole of visual novels. Which is something I thought I would never do.    ~ Snowdog 92%"
"Making recommendation with this playtime since I've finished the PS3 version many times and it's on sale right now.  Great JRPG, good port, well worth your money. Runs 144fps 1080p smoothly on my build."
"If you missed out on Valkyria Chronicles on PS3, here's your chance to catch up on a treasure of a game.  It's an excellent port at a great price, including all the DLC that effectively doubles the game length. My only qualm is that, with KBM, tank controls are sketchier and difficult to get used to. A gamepad is generally preferable in this case but you can definitely play with either.  This is probably my favourite strategy RPG of all time. Progression through stats alone is not enough to get ahead, you have to adapt to the terrain and enemy team in every match to get ahead. Gameplay is engaging and fun, and very satisfying, though with some understandable quirks that could be corrected (but there hasn't been anything like this so they can be forgiven). Any given battle is a significant investment of time, and you end up getting a ton of mileage out of the game as a consequence. Each of the units and classes are useful in their own ways and you will use all of them healthily. It's well-balanced.  The orchestrated OST is stellar, the watercolour art engine is outstanding, voice acting is professional and draws from all kinds of actors. The story is probably overwrought with war movie tropes, but the world-building surrounding Europa and the background attributed to the characters, weapons and countries are captivating. It's a product of love.  Valkyria Chronicles is one of my favourite games of all time, is what I'm saying. The PC port captures everything great about it. Absolutely look into it, it's a unique game that anyone can enjoy."
"Gorgeous visuals, awesome merge of turn based strategy and action, and moving story with lots of characters to like (and others to hate). The port is solid in control options, resolution and FPS. The cutscenes were rendered at 720p on PS3 and they are the same in the port. Valkyria Chronicles is one of the few games, developed by Sega in-house Japanese studios, that are worth remembering from the past ten years."
"If you enjoy games like final fantasy tactics, i think you'd enjoy this."
"Probably one of my top 3 favorite games of all time.  I really don't know what it is about this game that makes me love it so much...  But I think its that pleasure that comes from making a team of interesting characters that work well together. Every character has a their own unique personality and you find yourself growing attached to them and relying on them. I would find myself talking to them. Telling my sniper 'You got this shot, I know you do, I'm not even worried about it.' or yelling at a downed man 'Today is not the day you die, we're coming for you!'  Any friend I would talk to would have different people on their team and different characters they rely on themselves.  Anyway I could write paragraphs about the interesting levels, story, upgradableable gear, music, etc. But I'm only going to say its all great, all of it.  If you like strategy and story, you will not be disappointed."
"An amazing turn base, strategic rpg shooter. Great story line that takes a bulk of the gameplay, the missions make you excited for the next one.   Pros: -YOU GET A TANK, what else can you want -Amazing art work/ animations -Upgradeable weaponry -Witty unique personalities that evolve with the game play. - Funny unit movement noises  Cons:  -Difficulty with the tank movement -Confusing areas where you can't go over small barriers or terrain that are smaller than the sandbags -Semi confusing to look up unit stats in battle"
"Tactical WWII Anime. What's not to love? Investing story, tough mix of third person shooter and strategy RPG elements, intriguing characters, and beautiful cell-shaded art style. Fantastic experience overall, and a great example of something done a little different from the norm, but a job well done."

"I am now on the final mission of this game and it has surpassed all of my expectations. Playing this game has been a hugely enjoyable and thoroughly rewarding experience, and I already know that this will easily become one of my favourite games of all time. If you wish to know in detail why I feel this, please continue reading.  The storyline, for me, is flawless. I originally expected it to be a strange retelling of World War 2, but instead I was treated to a long and gripping plot including hugely likable characters and storyline developments that I genuinely didn't see coming. At one point it even brought me to tears. Until now I had honestly felt that I had grown out of JRPGs, but this game certainly proved me wrong.  Gameplay-wise, Valkyria Chronicles can be a very, very frustrating game to be honest, but frustrating in a GOOD way. Whilst it is true that character movement (and particularly tank movement) is a little clunky, I never found myself hating the game because of it. When I became frustrated it was because Valkyria Chronicles is challenging and very unforgiving. If you make a tactical mistake or stupid movement with your troops, you will be very lucky not to be punished for it and rightly so. This game makes no excuses for not holding your hand and giving you an easy ride. Similarly, it will reward you for thinking strategically and this is the beauty of the game for me. There was no lengthy tutorial detailing every single strategy available to me. You start the game with a simple mission, begin to naturally acquire a feel for the controls, and before you realise it you are thinking of ways to effectively move your troops and prioritise targets. Valkyria Chronicles masterfully hides what it is teaching you so much that you don't even realise you've progressed until you return to older missions and annihilate the enemy with euphoric ease. It's just a real pleasure to play through this game. It never makes you feel like an idiot or treats you like one, which for me is a trap that many current generation games fall into.  Graphically Valkyria Chronicles looks surprisingly good for a PlayStation 3 game from 2008. SEGA have done a wonderful job of upscaling the graphics and sharpening up the user interface. I have no complaints whatsoever, and would even praise it for its use of a beautiful hand-drawn style cel shading which has aged considerably well.  In conclusion, I highly and thoroughly recommend this game to anyone, and I really mean that! I am neither a strategy game fan, nor a big JRPG fan (the last JRPG I played and really enjoyed was Final Fantasy VII!), and yet this game grabbed me by the heart strings and pulled me in. It's simply a very, very good game and as a gamer I honestly wish that there were more games like this being made these days."
"VC is a really good game with some flaws in the gameplay and other things .  the game is mix between 3rd person shooter and TBS , the gameplay is really good but there's a flaw in defense mechanic and the only way to defense your untis is by crawling through the bush or satying behind a sand bag if you did this you get extra defense but let me expalin the problem :  a unit with defense needs 10 shots to die  a unit without defense needs 5 shots to die  but still if you sneak behind him you need to a 10 shots to kill him so it's not about the place it's just a binary thing either 0 or 1   combat is not the only thing in this game , you have a big system management upgrading the classes,weapons,tanks and you can choose from a different soilders to fight with you every one of them have his/her own personality and these personality can effect them in the combat .   the story was really good until you reach the sec half of the game and the game slpas you and the game become A ♥♥♥♥ING ANIME CLICHE.  both the soundtrack and the art style are really good it toatlly fit the game but the game is anime so if you hate anime you would probably hate it   Pros: -The system mangment  -The characters  -gameplay -soundtrack and the art style  Cons: -the menu is so terrible  -a flaw in defense mechanic -you can't skip or speed up the enemy turns -the game don't give any kind of into about the upgrades .  -the way you play a cutscenes is annoying and they're on 720p .  Conclusion: if the anime thing doesn't bothers you then go buy it , yes it have some flaws but the game is enjoyble and unique.  sorry for poor my grammar ."
"This game got me addicted to playing it and took 76 hours of my life. I played it until I've achieved every achievement and finished everything I can do with this game. It breaks my heart deleting it on my hard drive, but all good things must come to an end. Salute to squad 7 and to all of Gallia!  So here's my short review.  The graphics of this game is what you would expect an anime game to look like. It's well designed and the movements of the characters are very smooth and not clunky.  The voice acting and the BGMs were great.  You can choose wether the audio is in english or japanese.  The gameplay was awesome. A combination of turn-based, fps, third person game. I really don't know what it's called but it sure is awesome! :D  The story is told in a book-style menu where each scene is there in chapters and you can view the scenes as many times as you want. The story is well told though.  The mechanics of this game are well explained. It's not that complicated and you'll surely get used to it in no time.  The DLCs are free and there's the story mode and the skirmish mode. There's so many thing to do in this game.  Check it out on YouTube if you really wanna know what this game has in store for you. I don't know how to rate these kind of things but because of the experience I had with this game and the 76 hours that my life had a sense of purpose again (LOL)   I'll give it a whopping 10/10. "
"There are very few games I like as much as this one. It offers a genre of gameplay that I've never seen before and has story elements that I would generally consider very bad in a video game, but manages to pull it off amazingly well.  Tied in first for my favorite video game."
"A solid game. The gameplay is a strategy game with pretty simple controls, and a third-person perspective. You have a limited number of moves each turn, and each unit has a meter that runs out as they walk around. You also get one attack or action per move. The graphics have a nice anime look to them, like the textures were painted. The story is interesting, and there is some decent character development. Weapons and tanks can be upgraded, and your units can train to level up using experience gained from battles won. I like how every member of your squad has their own personality and backstory. Each has a few unique perks too, like certain terrain they perform better in, or types of units they are stronger against - even other soldiers that they like to be around.  If you like squad-based strategy games like X-Com, you'll probably like this game as well.  Squad 7, move out!"
"A great port of a great game.  The gameplay is solid, and can be reasonably difficult. Your squad members CAN die permanently, but on the other hand you will earn more rewards from missions if they are completed quickly, so riskier moves can be quite tense. Missions will never feel impossibly hard, but you will always want to pass with your entire squad intact. (Somewhat like XCOM: Enemy Unknown)  Valkyria Chronicles has a really diverse cast, each with their own backgrounds, strengths and weaknesses. The game is quite story-based, and there are several optional side missions that flesh out the squad.  Finally, the game looks amazing with a unique art style. Here's hoping to ports of the sequels!"
Not only a good game by itself but also a proof that console port can be done well.
"If you are looking for a non-clichéd story driven RPG, are looking for complex strategy, or enjoy games such as Fire Emblem (this has the pernament death feature, too), this game is for you. The CANVAS engine also makes the game look beautiful, like a meticulously-drawn anime.  It has a great learning curve, too. Do yourself a favour and buy this game!"
I loved this game on the PS3 and now I can love it all over again on my PC. The port is surprisingly great. I highly recommend this game to fans of strategy/RPG games you won't be disappointed.
Great game with a great story.
"Favourite game now on PC, and the port is excellent.  SEGA remake 2 and 3 for current gen already ;_;"
"Not sure why people are slating the controls, Mouse and keyboard work just as good as a controller. I originally bought my PS3 just for this game and now that I've got it on PC it's even better.  The included DLC for free is such a nice touch as I missed out on some. Game was released 10 hours early, which is a bonus. Japanese and English is included. Gotta love dem Japanese voice actors. Gameplay is smooth and combat is just as remembered.   Bring on VC 2 and VC 3 Sega? Please!."

Great
It's ported very well. Sure the interface isn't fully incorporating a mouse but the pop-ups show what keyboards commands are required at the correct moments and you can 'look' around with the mouse in a reliable fashion.  Story is a good localization of what is your typical Japanese themes but set in the harsh reality of an industrial war.  Great musical score and the mechanics are reliable. You can look at any PS3 review for this game and it will hold up with no porting issues. Sega has done a good job here.
"This is the same game as the one on the PS3, meaning it's still a great game. The port works just fine, though config is done out of game and if you run a potato, you might not be able to play this game.  Maybe if we keep buying jRPGs SEGA will finally bring over PSO2? Let's not get ahead of ourselves."
"A truly unique experience, reminiscent of strategy RPGs with a third-person shooter twist added. A well written story and a memorable cast of characters rounds out this must-play game."
"One of the best strategy RPG/JRPG's out there, do yourself a favor and buy it.  Sidenote: Also a pretty decent port."
"Decent port. I absolutely love this game. Highly reccommended if you like Turn-based Strategy.  What is it?   I guess you could say its a mix between XCOM and Fire Emblem. It's an undeniably Japanese take on World War II, and it works.   The cell-shaded graphics are gorgeous, though cutscenes can be quite grainy. Everything on the in-game engine looks fabulous though. The game has a fantastic art style.   I will say that most of the in-game menu cannot be controlled via mouse. It is obviously not ideal but as PC players, this is something we have to put up with when playing some console ports. Other than that the port is pretty great."
Game is insanely fun and runs really well. Never thought I'd see 60fps on this crappy computer but this game delivers it.  It plays like the Fire Emblem game I always wanted.. but with guns.  The story so far is pretty good as well.
"If you haven't played this game on the ps3, you really need take advantage of this port, it's got all the DLC bundled up with it and hopefully, maaaybe, since Steam peoples blew Segas mind on how well this sold on just its first day, we'll get the rest of the series!  Marina Wulfstan is best girl, demon on the battlefield with the eye of the devil."
"At first, I was way of replaying a classic that I had already passed on the PS3.  But then I thought about it, and so I said to myself...  'I can go another round.'  And it was worth the extra shot."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a charming game originally deployed on the PS3 6 years ago.   The game is based on a fictive version of a 2nd world war era Europe. 2 large ntions / alliances of nations dukes it out in an attempt to control a multipurpose ressourse, the ragnite, that has become scarcier. Stuck in between the two major powers, a small independant nation, names Gallia, struggles to maintain its neutrality until one of the major powers, the eastern empire, turns its gaze upon the large ragnite reserves it posseses. It is now up to a small band of civilians of all origins enroled into the millitia to defend the contry and push back the eastern invaders. The player controls squad 7 of the militia. The game is a strategy role playing game with several unique twist to its game mechanics:  The missions rewards the players who manages to reach the final objective in the shortest delays, encouraging risky tactics over attrition tactics. A mission will rank the player based on the number of turns it takes to accomplish the main objective. Each ranks gives a different amounth of xp and cash and the difference between each ranks can be very noticeable. The difference in gain from a Rank A reward and a B rank rewards can make killing all units more of a hinderance than anything, as they'll never fill the gap of xp between the 2 fo example.  Each turns are made up of a player phase, where the player gets to use his command points as he fits, and then, the enemy phase who does the same. The player don't need to play all his units in a turn, nor is he limited to use each units once. Indeed, he can active multiple times the same units over the course of his phase, but each extra time the character is activated, the movement points are reduced, causing a gradually more limited movement range. Furthermore, several weapons and actions have a limited amonth of use per phase and usually regenerates of only one use per turns (exemple, sniper rifles can shoot only 3 bullets, and only recovers 1 bullet per turns, so if the player shot three times this turn, the next turn he will only have one shot).   Keep in mind however, that command points are limited, and some other things uses command points. For instance, tanks consume 2 points of commands and the player can also use 'orders' which gives a boost to either a single unit or entire squads or can allow for some special actions like sniper support or instant evacs for different costs depending on the specific order.  An important difference in gamplay mechanics is that whenever you select a unit, you fall in a 3rd person perspective and control the character directly. I can make 1 action (shoot, heal, repair, throw grenade) and can move as long as your movement gauge has some points in it. Some skills may trigger at any time during the activation, giving buffs or debuffs on your character's actions, thus influencing the results of the actions.   While in action mode, the character player by the character is subject to counter fires by all tanks, scout, shocktrooper and engineer units in firing range, as such, the player cannot just waltz in enemy lines unattended. Also, when the player attacks any of the stated classes but fails to kill them, they can make a single counter attack, making the management of a unit's HP primodial in the action phase. But what is true for the player, is also true for the enemy. A good positionning of the player's units can make a formidable line of defence. A bad positionning can lead to death however, so it is recommended to end each character's final turn in hiding or in cover, in order to improve their chances of survival.  Each characters comes with 3 or 4 personality traits who can be beneficial (like hard worker which allows a second action) or hindering (like pollen allergy which generat an hp loss whenever your character walks in the grass) and each characters have their own unique combination of those. Furthermoe, each characters have access to up to 4 benefical potentials based on their class, giving even more variety in each units.  There is perma death in this game for every sub characters. While story characters are immune to this, they become unavailable for the rest of the mission. This occurs when a character is reduced to 0 hp and he is either left ther for three turns unattended, or that the enemy walks up to him first. In order to avoid this, the player needs to either send a unit next to the downed man or spend some command points and use the appropriate order to force an evac of the unit without risking another unite for the job.  Another twist is that the xp earned in a fight is considered a squad exp rather than an individual one, like most games of the genre. This exp can then be spent on leveling up classes as the player wishes it. When a class is leveled, all characters of that class are leveled along with it, even those not currently part of you selected squad. This design choice allows the player to try out different characters without suffering the drawback of a character underleveled compared to the current state of the game.  The visuals of the game stands up very well despite being 6 years old. The graphics juggle between anime style and watercolor painting giving it a unique artstyle that can stand the test of time. Each environnement are well depicted and their atmosphere well expressed. Details go as far as giving a unique face to each of your prospect squand members, giving them a identity and a personality despite not being integral part of the story. Even some Onomatopoeia can be see on screen whenever a tank moves, a gun shoots or some other interesting sounds occurs while in slide shows during story sequences, giving the feeling to read a comic book.  The menus and between mission events are all integrated in a book style interface, as if all you experience in the game is red through scriptures and images of the book, this way of navigating through the menu allows the player to remain immersed in the game's universe even though you are in the meta management of your squad. I found it charming and pretty unique in its own right.  Sound is another part of the game where lots of love was poured into. The original sound track is one of the bestI listened to in the industry, channeling through strong emotions whenever it was needed. Likewise, the voice acting / dubbing is pretty good, and the player can even choose between Japanese or English voice over, both being of very good quality.  In short, it is a beautiful game full with unique mechanics and personality that deserves to be tried out. My game on the ps3 lasted for a good 40+ hours and I stilll had the dlc to finish. The PC port, when played with a game controller, is very much like the PS3 version, with generally better FPS. I did encounter some major slow downs shortly after some in missions events triggered while in 3rd person mode, but they are few and far in betwee and usually don't last long.  I have been preaching the virtues of this game for 6 years now, and those who decided to give it a try, loved it. The game was cursed by near inexistant marketting on a very prolific gaming year and passed mostly unnoticed by gamers of the time. Sega is now giving the francise a second chance and I can only hope that, this time, the game will get the recognition it deserves :D"
"Looks great, runs great. An excellent port of the original. If unsure about the game, check out gameplay videos first! Be wary of a small issue when running at more than 60hz refresh rates, though! (Tanks will get stuck at slopes)."
It's Valkyria Chronicles...It was amazing on the PS3 and it's even better here. It's definitely worth it and it's an excellent port that handles both visual optimization and controls perfectely well.
"Played VC for the PS3 and I'm very pleased to see it on steam. Valkyria Chronicles is a solid turn based third person strategy/shooter with a very nice art style and story. The only issue I have with it is you're rewarded for how fast you complete a mission, not how WELL you complete the mission.  Inbetween missions you can choose which classes of units you'd like to improve, what weapons you're interested in fielding, and what characters you'd like to depoy. I guarantee you'll find your favourites.  If you like turned based games I'd highly reccomend it. Enjoy in 60FPS."
"Let not its anime style deceive you - Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing strategy game with a deep plot which will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire experience. If this is the first time you've heard of Valkyria Chronicles, do not hesitate to purchase it, for you will be rewarded with a one-of-a-kind gem that will enchant you with its beauty, gameplay and story."

Even some Onomatopoeia can be see on screen whenever a tank moves, a gun shoots or some other interesting sounds occurs while in slide shows during story sequences, giving the feeling to read a comic book.  The menus and between mission events are all integrated in a book style interface, as if all you experience in the game is red through scriptures and images of the book, this way of navigating through the menu allows the player to remain immersed in the game's universe even though you are in the meta management of your squad. I found it charming and pretty unique in its own right.  Sound is another part of the game where lots of love was poured into. The original sound track is one of the bestI listened to in the industry, channeling through strong emotions whenever it was needed. Likewise, the voice acting / dubbing is pretty good, and the player can even choose between Japanese or English voice over, both being of very good quality.  In short, it is a beautiful game full with unique mechanics and personality that deserves to be tried out. My game on the ps3 lasted for a good 40+ hours and I stilll had the dlc to finish. The PC port, when played with a game controller, is very much like the PS3 version, with generally better FPS. I did encounter some major slow downs shortly after some in missions events triggered while in 3rd person mode, but they are few and far in betwee and usually don't last long.  I have been preaching the virtues of this game for 6 years now, and those who decided to give it a try, loved it. The game was cursed by near inexistant marketting on a very prolific gaming year and passed mostly unnoticed by gamers of the time. Sega is now giving the francise a second chance and I can only hope that, this time, the game will get the recognition it deserves :D"
"Looks great, runs great. An excellent port of the original. If unsure about the game, check out gameplay videos first! Be wary of a small issue when running at more than 60hz refresh rates, though! (Tanks will get stuck at slopes)."
It's Valkyria Chronicles...It was amazing on the PS3 and it's even better here. It's definitely worth it and it's an excellent port that handles both visual optimization and controls perfectely well.
"Played VC for the PS3 and I'm very pleased to see it on steam. Valkyria Chronicles is a solid turn based third person strategy/shooter with a very nice art style and story. The only issue I have with it is you're rewarded for how fast you complete a mission, not how WELL you complete the mission.  Inbetween missions you can choose which classes of units you'd like to improve, what weapons you're interested in fielding, and what characters you'd like to depoy. I guarantee you'll find your favourites.  If you like turned based games I'd highly reccomend it. Enjoy in 60FPS."
"Let not its anime style deceive you - Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing strategy game with a deep plot which will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire experience. If this is the first time you've heard of Valkyria Chronicles, do not hesitate to purchase it, for you will be rewarded with a one-of-a-kind gem that will enchant you with its beauty, gameplay and story."
"So, I originally had bought this game for the PS3. When that console died, it was one of the few things I was truly sad I couldn't play again. When I was told that it was being ported to PC, I spazzed. Like a giddy little schoolgirl hearing that her crush likes her. I was absolutely ecstatic. While I was worried due to the fact that Sega's past PC ports have been problematic, this game is not one of those. It plays if not better than, just as well as it did on the console."
"Great game and a great port. Graphics, music, and gameplay are incredible."
Killing Imps for Gallia all day long. 100/10 must get. Catherine O'Hara for MVP sniper.
"I have a habbit of never finishing many games as i end up moving after getting bored, this is not one of those games, i loved it from start to finish on the PS3 and im pretty sure ill do the same again this time around even though there are some major games coming out just around the corner. Its a fantastic blend of turn based stratagy and live action, i use the term live action just because during the movement of troops the game is 'live' and you can and will be shot at in line of sight until you either aim or end that troops turn"
"Just as glorious as I remembered! Pretty good story told through some of the best Turn Based strategy of last generation. The World War II inspired setting is really unique and gives some familiarity without hamfisting it down your throat.   In terms of the port: It's just about average. You can launch into a configuration window but all it really gives you is the ability to switch between keyboard and controller, although it does give you the ability to rebind keys! Which is often overlooked on PC ports.  Another problem about this port is that if you chose to use the keyboard, you'll have to use it to control menus since this has no mouse support for that. In combat you can use mouse aim and select units with the mouse but that's as much integration as it gets.   Last but not least, there is no graphics menu....not that the game is worse for it since the art style is fantastic, but i was kind of excited to maybe see some AA or DSR options (which you could force through Nvidia Control Panel). It's not that big of a deal to me for a game as rich in art and atmosphere as this, but it certainly would have been an improvment.  In the end I plugged in my gamepad since this was clearly designed with a controller in mind and unfortanatly Sega didnt do much to give it a PC makeover. (It seems like it would be an easy thing to patch in, so this could be an outdated problem someday.) I am enjoying Valkyria Chronicles immensely and anyone who didnt have a PS3 last gen to experience one of the best tactical RPG's Sega has to offer, I highly recommend you pick this up."
"Its the same old game ported from the ps3. If you played that one then this will be no different but will always have a place in my library. For new people getting into this then your in for a wild ride. Controls are finicky but still manageable. Its a tactical game so making small moves in wrong directions or aiming will greatly affect your outcome. Story is a strange twist to the genre of a war(very similar to what we already know) but adding an anime twist to it. Check out old reviews and base yoru decision off that, but i highly recommend this game."
Great classic! BUY IMMEDIATELY!!!!
"This is one of the rarer games that can hold my attention for longer than one evening. The story is gripping, the artstyle is very much unique. Japanese voice-over is wonderful, as always. And on top of it, there's a nice strategic skirmish simulator. Nice PC port is just an icing on the cake."
"This game i bought purely because of the art style and the turn based combat, however above that i found myself really enjoying this game.  Pros: Art style, Story, Characters. I had read barely anything about this game before buying, but found myself getting really into the story. It really is enjoyable, theirs not any boring characters or corny catch frases (YAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYY)  Negs: Customization, Battles.  I'm using these fairly loosely, customization came in because you can't create your own character or really edit much about the characters you use. (Aside from weapons.) Battles came in as it definetly has it quirks.  eg1: My lancer (Anti-Tank) got hit with a bullet from an enemy which can lower attack. My Lancer was then unable to do ANY damage to a tank, which when you have no other lances nearby is very annoying because of a bullet...  eg2: Even the perfect headshot from a sniper or any weapon will not count as headshots because they are crouching behind cover... Even if you flank the people, headshots still don't count...   These being said, i find myself playing for the story, it has so many lovely characters. I watch ALL cut scenes, the combat can be pretty grindy, but it's definetly a fun game. Has many feels and found myself close to crying :')  Gud tears :')"
One of the best tactic jrpg now on PC. You should also try it :)
This game is currently the most top sold game on steam and it's been out for only 24 hours. Need I say more? 
"An anti-war game about a war released on Remembrance Day, coincidence? Great port from saga, and one of the finest game of the 7th generation"
I loved this game on the PS3 and now I can love it all over again on my PC. The port is surprisingly great. I highly recommend this game to fans of strategy/RPG games you won't be disappointed.
"I will be honest. I only know about this game from Prject X Zone which, in my opinion, is basicly a catelogue for games people should get. Never thought I'd find it on Steam! Anyway...  A strategic, 3rd person shooter game in the style of Anime. The gameplay is great, frankly. The gameplay is reminescent of a cross of Risk, Civilization, and a bit of TF2 (personal opinion it's a good thing), plus anime. The main amazing thing is each character is unique and has their own story, their own pros/cons, and even things they like/dislike to do. I found one who doesn't like killing, and wont act if they have to attack. Most willingly fight, so dont worry. I have only just gotten into this game, but I am hooked. I'd give it a 8/10. Why not more? *cough* no megaman *cough*"
Amazing and beatiful game. I'm glad this is finally on PC.
"If you enjoy turn-based strategy games, definitely give this a try. Imagine the Fire Emblem or X-com games, but instead of a top-down panel system, it uses a limited meter to allow you to freely roam with a third person camera/controls."
"Ah yes, Valkyria Chronicles. A verry interesting entry in the SRPG (strategy role playing game) genre. This game occurs in an alternate universe earth where the east Empire fights the Federation (sounds familiar?) and when the Empire decides to attack a neutral by stander country. A pair of young adults must take arms and defend their homeland at all costs.   A bonus: this game comes with the Japanese voice over(in addition to the english dub) as well as all the DLC released on the PS3 version. If you like games like Final Fantasy Tactics or Shining Force, this is a game would yould like."
Cohesive WWII anime feel. Story has a gentle buildup that does a good job introducing you to the story and gameplay. You need to like the slow pace of Tactical RPGs. You will have to re-fight battles and understaand you opponent.
"A true WWII anime-based strategy game that influences events from that time period. Great 'rustic' graphics to help depict the concept of the era. If you like turn-based strategies with war 'plot', then I highly suggest buying Valkyria Chronicles without hesitation. Alicia/10"
"One of my favorites from the PS3 generation. It's got a definate JRPG feel to it, but it's the tactic based battles I enjoyed most. I didn't need to buy this, since I have it on PS3.. I did anyway because I want to see more games like this in wild, and for all platforms.  Anyway it's quite fun. I hope to see the other games in the franchise moved over. Glad sega did this."
"I usually wait for a game I am interested in before buying a video game console. And this one was the one which made me buy a PS3. The team behind it is composed of people who worked on games like Sakura Wars and Skies of Arcadia. The OST is from the man behind the ones of Final Fantasy Tactics, Final Fantasy XII and Tactics Ogre.  The game itself is like a mix of traditional (square movement based) tactical RPG and third person shooter. The movement is free and aiming involves a manual part instead of being only based on the character skills.  Each fight brings a new element to the gameplay and the inclusion of tanks units for cover and orders from the commanding unit to alter the fight are nice additions.  You can build your team of characters out of a large cast and each of them as special characteristics that can heavily influence their attitude in combat. For instance, some perform better when they are alone, some gets better stats when running fiercely into battle and worse stats when they are forced to advance carefully.  As far as I have seen the PC port works well and the mouse control is quite helpfull when it comes to aiming. All original DLCs are included and the price is reasonable. It seems to support any resolution as well as any refresh rate. However, be aware that the cutscenes are not rendered in real time and seems to use the original from the PS3 (which were not that bad but in 720p without AA)."
"As good as ps3 version, plus all the dlc goodness. Still cheaper to buy this pc ver for ps3 dlc for my psn."

"This is the same game as the one on the PS3, meaning it's still a great game. The port works just fine, though config is done out of game and if you run a potato, you might not be able to play this game.  Maybe if we keep buying jRPGs SEGA will finally bring over PSO2? Let's not get ahead of ourselves."
"A truly unique experience, reminiscent of strategy RPGs with a third-person shooter twist added. A well written story and a memorable cast of characters rounds out this must-play game."
"One of the best strategy RPG/JRPG's out there, do yourself a favor and buy it.  Sidenote: Also a pretty decent port."
"Decent port. I absolutely love this game. Highly reccommended if you like Turn-based Strategy.  What is it?   I guess you could say its a mix between XCOM and Fire Emblem. It's an undeniably Japanese take on World War II, and it works.   The cell-shaded graphics are gorgeous, though cutscenes can be quite grainy. Everything on the in-game engine looks fabulous though. The game has a fantastic art style.   I will say that most of the in-game menu cannot be controlled via mouse. It is obviously not ideal but as PC players, this is something we have to put up with when playing some console ports. Other than that the port is pretty great."
Game is insanely fun and runs really well. Never thought I'd see 60fps on this crappy computer but this game delivers it.  It plays like the Fire Emblem game I always wanted.. but with guns.  The story so far is pretty good as well.
"If you haven't played this game on the ps3, you really need take advantage of this port, it's got all the DLC bundled up with it and hopefully, maaaybe, since Steam peoples blew Segas mind on how well this sold on just its first day, we'll get the rest of the series!  Marina Wulfstan is best girl, demon on the battlefield with the eye of the devil."
"At first, I was way of replaying a classic that I had already passed on the PS3.  But then I thought about it, and so I said to myself...  'I can go another round.'  And it was worth the extra shot."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a charming game originally deployed on the PS3 6 years ago.   The game is based on a fictive version of a 2nd world war era Europe. 2 large ntions / alliances of nations dukes it out in an attempt to control a multipurpose ressourse, the ragnite, that has become scarcier. Stuck in between the two major powers, a small independant nation, names Gallia, struggles to maintain its neutrality until one of the major powers, the eastern empire, turns its gaze upon the large ragnite reserves it posseses. It is now up to a small band of civilians of all origins enroled into the millitia to defend the contry and push back the eastern invaders. The player controls squad 7 of the militia. The game is a strategy role playing game with several unique twist to its game mechanics:  The missions rewards the players who manages to reach the final objective in the shortest delays, encouraging risky tactics over attrition tactics. A mission will rank the player based on the number of turns it takes to accomplish the main objective. Each ranks gives a different amounth of xp and cash and the difference between each ranks can be very noticeable. The difference in gain from a Rank A reward and a B rank rewards can make killing all units more of a hinderance than anything, as they'll never fill the gap of xp between the 2 fo example.  Each turns are made up of a player phase, where the player gets to use his command points as he fits, and then, the enemy phase who does the same. The player don't need to play all his units in a turn, nor is he limited to use each units once. Indeed, he can active multiple times the same units over the course of his phase, but each extra time the character is activated, the movement points are reduced, causing a gradually more limited movement range. Furthermore, several weapons and actions have a limited amonth of use per phase and usually regenerates of only one use per turns (exemple, sniper rifles can shoot only 3 bullets, and only recovers 1 bullet per turns, so if the player shot three times this turn, the next turn he will only have one shot).   Keep in mind however, that command points are limited, and some other things uses command points. For instance, tanks consume 2 points of commands and the player can also use 'orders' which gives a boost to either a single unit or entire squads or can allow for some special actions like sniper support or instant evacs for different costs depending on the specific order.  An important difference in gamplay mechanics is that whenever you select a unit, you fall in a 3rd person perspective and control the character directly. I can make 1 action (shoot, heal, repair, throw grenade) and can move as long as your movement gauge has some points in it. Some skills may trigger at any time during the activation, giving buffs or debuffs on your character's actions, thus influencing the results of the actions.   While in action mode, the character player by the character is subject to counter fires by all tanks, scout, shocktrooper and engineer units in firing range, as such, the player cannot just waltz in enemy lines unattended. Also, when the player attacks any of the stated classes but fails to kill them, they can make a single counter attack, making the management of a unit's HP primodial in the action phase. But what is true for the player, is also true for the enemy. A good positionning of the player's units can make a formidable line of defence. A bad positionning can lead to death however, so it is recommended to end each character's final turn in hiding or in cover, in order to improve their chances of survival.  Each characters comes with 3 or 4 personality traits who can be beneficial (like hard worker which allows a second action) or hindering (like pollen allergy which generat an hp loss whenever your character walks in the grass) and each characters have their own unique combination of those. Furthermoe, each characters have access to up to 4 benefical potentials based on their class, giving even more variety in each units.  There is perma death in this game for every sub characters. While story characters are immune to this, they become unavailable for the rest of the mission. This occurs when a character is reduced to 0 hp and he is either left ther for three turns unattended, or that the enemy walks up to him first. In order to avoid this, the player needs to either send a unit next to the downed man or spend some command points and use the appropriate order to force an evac of the unit without risking another unite for the job.  Another twist is that the xp earned in a fight is considered a squad exp rather than an individual one, like most games of the genre. This exp can then be spent on leveling up classes as the player wishes it. When a class is leveled, all characters of that class are leveled along with it, even those not currently part of you selected squad. This design choice allows the player to try out different characters without suffering the drawback of a character underleveled compared to the current state of the game.  The visuals of the game stands up very well despite being 6 years old. The graphics juggle between anime style and watercolor painting giving it a unique artstyle that can stand the test of time. Each environnement are well depicted and their atmosphere well expressed. Details go as far as giving a unique face to each of your prospect squand members, giving them a identity and a personality despite not being integral part of the story. Even some Onomatopoeia can be see on screen whenever a tank moves, a gun shoots or some other interesting sounds occurs while in slide shows during story sequences, giving the feeling to read a comic book.  The menus and between mission events are all integrated in a book style interface, as if all you experience in the game is red through scriptures and images of the book, this way of navigating through the menu allows the player to remain immersed in the game's universe even though you are in the meta management of your squad.

It takes place in europe but it's not europe and its during WWI but its not WWI and the main character lives in Switzerland but its not Switzerland and they're invaded by nazis but they're not nazis   This game is pretty cool if you want to kill hundreds of faceless stormtroopers in gameplay representing XCOM while looking kawaii as ♥♥♥♥.
"A true WWII anime-based strategy game that influences events from that time period. Great 'rustic' graphics to help depict the concept of the era. If you like turn-based strategies with war 'plot', then I highly suggest buying Valkyria Chronicles without hesitation. Alicia/10"
"I've bought this game 4 different times. Twice on PS3, the remastered on PS4 and now Steam. Such a beautiful game that combines tactics and strategy with real time battle. Love it. Hopefully I'll finish soon..."
"Do not let the cute anime style shy you away from this game, it is a serious and amazing game that I could not recommend enough at such low prices.   PROS   -Very gripping story about war, loss, racism, torture and the bonds that are formed to fight it -Amazing characters with rich backstory (even secondary ones have great personalities and tales to tell) -Innovative and fun turn-based combat, allowing every class and soldier to have a purpose -Beautifully hand-drawn artstyle -Much variety in customization for both characters and vehicles -Extra content such as skirmish battles and more episodes are well done   CONS   -Lot´s of cheesy dialogue spread throughout the game -A weird and useless 'winged piggy' thrown into the story -Tank controls aren´t very responsive -No Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 port for PC yet!  All in all, an excellent and seriously underrated game outside it´s genre, despite it´s good steam sales! Where are the sequels?!?!?!?"
"Magnificient game, this game has great art, a great story, and great strategic gameplay. The gameplay, while strategic, is also very active and exciting!"
Alicia OP in waifu rankings and squad status
"This is a slightly guilty pleasure for me. Guilty because I'm an older guy and it's obviously aimed at a young audience. On the other hand I still love Star Wars and Pixar movies so what the hell...  The game is set in an alternate universe World War 2ish with the main quest following one military unit and it's soon-to-be-a-hero commander as their own small country becomes the fulcrum in a continental war between two vastly larger powers. The enemy are also busy digging out ancient mystical artifacts which adds an Indiana Jones touch to the story.  Well polished (and child friendly) as it is the story aspect of the game is not the draw here. It's fun enough with lots of chat between missions and builds relationships with your team well. It also ties in nicely with the upgrade systems for your tank and troops but it's largely filler for me.  The campaign features turn-based tactical battles which are great fun and have greater tactical depth and graphical polish than the last XCOM. However, Valkyria swaps XCOM's more random spawnings in favour of more varied and strictly set-piece battles and this sacrifices replay value for a more definite winning tactic and subesquently a more satisfying victory. Apart from the early missions you go in to each battle first time hopefully, but expecting to lose and learning from your loss.   There is a good mix of large mass combat and small squad missions as well as skirmish maps to be unlocked as you progress and I've really enjoyed puzzling through the campaign. 8/10"
"Valkyria Chronicles is a fantastic port to PC - and a very unique turn based strategy game. It has a good flowing plot that clearly knows where it wants to go, and takes you there. The Voice acting is very well done (the game also allows for subtitles to go along with the audio) And the Art style of the game is fantastic. If you like Turn based strategy with an intelligent story, and a great touch of Romance- with J/RPG elements, make sure you add this game to your library you'll enjoy it and the many hours of gameplay."
"Well this is one of the best SEGA's game at all,   - Good graphic, i really love canvas style, its relaxing.  - Lovely story, where in the middle of war you can still feel the lovely romance between bug lover and baker. - There is some backstory for each squad. - Great soundtrack.   Welkin and Alicia Taste of Home event, Largo's 'YASAI ! BANZAI !', got a kiss from Rossie after killing an Imperial, and the ending.   10/10"
"Valkyria Chronicles has a lot of heart. It's one of the few games on the PS3 where I felt heavily invested in the characters - they're all so charming and wonderful.  Pros:  +Great characters and story +Fantastic music  +Beautiful canvas art style  +PC performance is great! Loading and save times are noticebly quicker than the PS3 version +It's an SRPG, but not a conventional one. The limited free-roaming is a breath of free air compared to other grid-like SRPGS. +Dual audio. Both the Japanese and English dub are great! +Marina  Honestly... I still can't believe this game made it to PC. PLAY IT!   "
"Look, I'm gonna be as honest as possible.   If you like RPG's the likes of the Tales Series and you also like guns and you also like Fire Emblem, you'll have a good time here. It's so hard to do tactical turn based stuff and guns but Valkyria does it well. The english voice acting is passable at best, but as usual english VA's butcher the ever-loving ♥♥♥♥ out of any emotional scene or comedy relief.   But at its roots its a good story about a bunch of non-veteran conscripted miltia teenagers who somehow outclass trained soldiers of a military empire. The gameplay is highly tactical and relies on the player to make quick decisions and think way ahead, but it gives newbier players the crutch of having an OP tank, so its alright for new players too.   TL;DR for my morning rambling, if you like RPGs with guns and you don't get stressed out by tactical games, give it a shot. It's 20 bucks and it's a hell of a lot better than a lot of the more expensive 'next-gen' games out there. The voice acting can be rough, but the characters are genuine and the gameplay is fun."
"Sure you have to either like anime or not mind that's part of the over all game design, but if you get past that the game mechanics in terms of the way turn based is mixed w/ a sort of FPS movement system, the layout of the story through a book and chapters, and all of the design over all works to present a cohesive well thought out and executed package.  And just to go on a bit about the game play, the turn based battles are immensely entertaining in the same vein as xcom. Really glad this got ported to the PC (a workable port at that). Here's hoping Sega pays attention to the sales numbers they've admited were way past their expectations and they bring VC2 and VC3 to the PC as well."
"From perspective of Valkyria Chronicles 2 player:  Pros: +The huge distances that a character can cover feel weird at first. However it reduce possibility that a character will lack literally one step to capture flag or crouch near sandbags. +Graphics and animation feels smother than portable version +It is easier to guess how close a character need to walk to an enemy to headshot without weirdly misses. +Characters stories  Cons: -Overly emotional, irrational character’s actions in some episodes. -Tanks need 2 CP to perform an action and since the distances are greater, there are useless even as moving shields (in some missions in VC2 that strategy was essential against heavy armor unit’s interception fire. BTW in VC3 even heavy tanks use 1CP). -No Mauler or Fencer units’ types, which are very interesting."
"Very Optimized for PC (Not like FF 13 ), I hope they bring more JRPG to steam."
"I dont usually write reviews, but this game did blow me away. I never played the PS3 version, but this game has an amazing story; very unforgiving tactical elements, great animation and character progression and a longer than expected storyline. Worth every penny, its not RTS, its tactical turn based, but you get to 'aim' and WASD all your units, then execute. but the moves are in a turn.  Well executed hybrid game play once you get the hang of some timing quirks unique to this game. If a storyline can grip you, then get ready for the feels.   oh the feels."
To me this is a good game with a good story :3
Edy and Marina are best girls
Great game and a great port
great port release.. with dual audio support.. nice work from sega.. :)
"One of my favorite JRPGs finally on PC, big thanks SEGA!  This game is a mix of a great many things:  +Great soundtrack.  +Beautiful art direction (if you like anime or animation in general).  +Engaging and rich story with elements from many sub-genres (war-drama, comedy, romance, just to name a few).  +Interesting storytelling mechanic (it's like a book filled with cutscenes and visual novel bits).  +Interesting mix of many sub-genres (role playing game, turn-based strategy, 3rd person action).  +Also, let's not forget the quality of the port (as many games recently have failed in that department, Valkyria Chronicles is not one of them)."
"As good as i hoped it would be! As a huge fan of the Jagged Alliance series and X-Com I was gutted this was PS3 only, but now its here at last and its good fun so far! The port is really good, playable with a keyboard without having to dislocated fingers as well. An under rated gem!"
The greatest game ever conceived by humans.
"PC Port of a PS3 classic, it holds up well and looks gorgeous. Combat is pretty straight forward, you move your units one at a time to kill enemy units, or to capture objectives. The music is great, the voice acting for English is good, if you don't want to jump over to the Japanese voices. Story is a bit simple, it gets the job done, though.   Also, the PC version comes with all of the DLC from the PS3 version.  You should play this game if you like SRPGs.  Edit: Forgot to mention the controls. Keyboard+Mouse works just fine, it's pretty much on par with a controller."

Loading and save times are noticebly quicker than the PS3 version +It's an SRPG, but not a conventional one. The limited free-roaming is a breath of free air compared to other grid-like SRPGS. +Dual audio. Both the Japanese and English dub are great! +Marina  Honestly... I still can't believe this game made it to PC. PLAY IT!   "
"Look, I'm gonna be as honest as possible.   If you like RPG's the likes of the Tales Series and you also like guns and you also like Fire Emblem, you'll have a good time here. It's so hard to do tactical turn based stuff and guns but Valkyria does it well. The english voice acting is passable at best, but as usual english VA's butcher the ever-loving ♥♥♥♥ out of any emotional scene or comedy relief.   But at its roots its a good story about a bunch of non-veteran conscripted miltia teenagers who somehow outclass trained soldiers of a military empire. The gameplay is highly tactical and relies on the player to make quick decisions and think way ahead, but it gives newbier players the crutch of having an OP tank, so its alright for new players too.   TL;DR for my morning rambling, if you like RPGs with guns and you don't get stressed out by tactical games, give it a shot. It's 20 bucks and it's a hell of a lot better than a lot of the more expensive 'next-gen' games out there. The voice acting can be rough, but the characters are genuine and the gameplay is fun."
"I watched the anime prior to even knowing that the game existed. I loved the anime so I had high expectations for this game and was I ever right. The story is slightly different and even though this isn't a graphically demanding game, it still holds its own charm with its unique art style.  With the gameplay, I didn't hold too high expectations since it didn't seem like my cup of tea, or so I thought. The gameplay with its rpg/turn based strategy system works amazingly well and no part ever seemed drawn out. It had me thinking of the best possible strategy to finish the battle as soon as possible in order to maximize my rating.  Even though I knew the story with all its plot twists, I still watched every single cutscene and had the chills run down my spine at points in the story.  Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys anime, strategy games, rpg games, and war games. And yes, the extra content that the reporter Ellet offers for sale is worth it if you love the story."
"I dont usually write reviews, but this game did blow me away. I never played the PS3 version, but this game has an amazing story; very unforgiving tactical elements, great animation and character progression and a longer than expected storyline. Worth every penny, its not RTS, its tactical turn based, but you get to 'aim' and WASD all your units, then execute. but the moves are in a turn.  Well executed hybrid game play once you get the hang of some timing quirks unique to this game. If a storyline can grip you, then get ready for the feels.   oh the feels."
this game is so good. buy it. i am tears before you. i claw at your wallet.   release your funds to this terrible company for this incredible game.
"This is, by far, one of my favorite games. I can't recommend it enough."
"GAMEPLAY: If you're a fan of turn based tactics, Valkyria Chronicles is right down your alley. The combat is a mix between multiple genres, where you look at a map of the level enviornment, with icons placed to represent units and objectives. Selecting a unit brings you down on to the battlefield, where you control them using a limited pool of AP (think stamina). Enemies aren't docile in this game, and if you're within a unit's range they'll defensively fire at you. This intercepting fire can be absolutely lethal, and forces you to think your tactics through in a way unlike most turn based games. In addition to commanding your units, you can also issue orders, which are effectively buffs (Caution is an especially useful one, which lowers the damage of the afformentioned intercepting fire). You also don't have to move each character once and end your turn, you move units from a pool of CP, with regular units costing one point, tanks two, and orders are variable but usually between one and three. You can also save your unused CP up to a maximum of twenty points.   The AI tends to be fairly intelligent for the most part, using cover and any special abilities they may have. They don't aim for the head, but the battles would be absolute curbstomps on their part otherwise. Sometimes they make silly mistakes, but they overall function properly.  One negative thing about the game is that the grading system for each stage rewards taking stupid risks and completing the objectives as fast as possible as opposed to a more tactical and careful method. This is good for speedrunners, but not so great for people fond of taking things nice and slow, as the diminished rewards of a lower score could serve to force you to grind in the skirmishes to keep up. Also, while usually fair, the game does have a couple massive difficulty spikes, especially when you have to fight a massive tank known as the Batomys (seriously, good luck getting through that without a walkthrough).   STORY: The story is satisfying, but it isn't anything to heap praise upon. You play as Welkin Gunther, and alongside your newly met friend Alicia and Darcsen sister Isara, you join the Gallian Militia. Two major powers, the Federation and Empire are at war with each other over the acquistion of a power source known as ragnite. Your little country of Gallia happens to be sitting on a lot of that precious stuff, so one of those factions (the evil sounding one), decides to invade your country. With superior numbers, technology, and overall everything, the country of Gallia is forced to start universal conscription. You, Welkin Gunther, are put in charge of the milita's Squad 7.  Each of the many characters you can recruit for your squad is their own, with a detailed backstory, full voice acting, and various potentials which can help and hinder in battle. Most of your squadmates are teenagers, as this is a JAPANESE game, and such is to be expected. A permadeath aspect of the game helps to raise the stakes, much like Nintendo's Fire Emblem.  The story does a good job of tackling the horrors of war, but it has it's flaws. SPOILERS ABOUND IN THIS PARAGRAPH BTW THIS WAS YOUR WARNING KTHNXBYE. The romantic relationship between Welkin and Alicia seems to be a bit forced, and doesn't seem to add much to the story. In addition, Alicia as a whole seems like a major Mary Sue. She's pretty, everybody likes her, she's the most powerful scout available, she's smart, a good cook, and is a Valkyur (an immensely powerful being) for some reason, and just wants to be normal. This could easily just be me, though.  SPOILER IS OVER URWELCOME. Overall, Valkyria Chronicles is worth picking up. If you don't like turn based combat, or have a strong aversion to anime, you should probably avoid it, but you also probably figured that out by now. By the way, one of the units totally looks like Gordon Freeman. If you'll play it you'll find out who I mean."
"The best game for PS3 now available for PC  Great port with the basic features you will expect from a PC game, good performance with solid 60fps, support for Arbitrary Resolutions, K+M support and remappable keys, controller support with vibration and Dual audio available.  If you're planning on buying this, DO IT! It's a great port of one of the greatest JRPGs in the history of the PS3."
"PC Port of a PS3 classic, it holds up well and looks gorgeous. Combat is pretty straight forward, you move your units one at a time to kill enemy units, or to capture objectives. The music is great, the voice acting for English is good, if you don't want to jump over to the Japanese voices. Story is a bit simple, it gets the job done, though.   Also, the PC version comes with all of the DLC from the PS3 version.  You should play this game if you like SRPGs.  Edit: Forgot to mention the controls. Keyboard+Mouse works just fine, it's pretty much on par with a controller."

"Easily the best 5€ I've ever spent. Attaching characters, riveting storyline and tense combats. I can't remember having been this much touched by a game since Homeworld. A most definitive must-have."
"Quality turn-based strategy.  Plenty of management options for your squad and just as many approaches you can pick from during the battle.  Anime art style is really nice. If you are a fan of 'Annie May', you will also care that there is a well done japanese voice acting. You will get to hear a lot of it as the game is 'story rich', featuring a couple of cutscenes and dialogue scenes between all combat missions.  Only thing I don't like are the menus."

"Very good game with unusual gameplay which using a combination of strategic and tactical mode. The fantasy WW2 world is also looking good, Gallia and Empire have it's own charm. Bad side of this game is a good characters with cool biography on the rival(imperial) side and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ scrubs on gallian(your) side. Also the war is looking wierd - 1 militiant squad repelling imperial army of invasion and killing whole Imperial government just becuase scriptwriter took some acid. 8/10 becuase there is no normal imperial campaign or even custom battles with possibility to choose own side"
Please don't read the reviews! Buy the damn game so SEGA can release Valkyria II for Steam as well!
"So Valykria Chronicles is a gem of a game. I enjoy it a lot. Instead of a standard meat and potatoes game, this game is a shmorgazborg of stuff. What's that? A turnbased game? Sure. Except your enemies fire at you as you try to move into position. Add a bit of tank warfare, weapon customization and loadout selections. Little troopers with individual personalities (Cherry is one of my favorites) - It's got a bit for everyone.   There are some cons. The battles are great but there are some that are.. kinda lame. 'Can only take out the enemy tank by hitting special super secret awesome singoku jidai weak points that only show up in xxxx situation' - that kinda lameness, which is abundant in Japanese video games, and requires - REQUIRES - you to look it up in a guide because theres no way you could've figured that out on your own.  BUT - the pros outweigh the cons in my opinion. So what are you waiting for (unless it's a sale you're waiting for)! Buy this game! It's awesome, and then you, me and Largo can all get VIOLENT FOR VEGETABLES!"
"I would like to correct a few things. A big thank you to Firehawk for helping me see the game through the anime. If you haven't read his reviews you really should (someone give that man a job!)  I love this game. However, it does have many, many flaws. Again thank you to Firehawk for helping me acknowledge what i knew but wouldn't accept.  Let's get past the bad part, the gameplay. I won't go into too much detail as others (*cough* Firehawk *cough*) have done a pretty good job, but I shall summarise. Enemies that stand still and take bullets, moments where the AI is incredibly dumb, a very odd leveling system, unbalanced gameplay, some units that respond to incoming fire (scouts, shocktroopers and tanks) and some that don't (all the others) as well as several poorly planned scenarios. Oh you may need to have a certain tolearance for occasional poor dubbing and repetitive soundtracks. There that'll do. For full details see Firehawk.  Now onto what sells this game, aesthetics and writing (though according to some the latter needed work). Beautifully styled anime graphics mean it is the best looking turn based strategy game one can play. Anime fans will instantly be in love with how this game LOOKS.  The best part though, by far, is the setting and characters.    In all my time video gaming I have never seen a game of this type that went to so much trouble, not only to create a great game, but also to craft an intricate plotline and give us great characters that we really want to keep alive. You REALLY feel like you have lost a friend and ally if a unit goes down and you are unable to get a medic to them before they die! There are at least fifty (though there may be more i have yet to encounter) units All units divided into five classes suited to various combat roles. Each is genuinley an individual with they're own personality, strengths weaknesses and even little things like being a neat freak that can affect combat. All of this together equals a need to really think ahead, plan and use every advantage in order to complete your mission and bring all of squad seven home alive.  So yes if you play this game, play it as a form of escapism, or as a person who simply enjoys anime and beautiful design. If you are a hardcore tactical and strategy fan, you will be dissapointed. I will still recommend this game for people who are strategy/tactical fans or anime fans (or if you are like me, both)."
"I will probably never remeber how i got to purchase(found?!) this game, but one evening when i finally started it up, was dam good discovery for me, because this game offers something else. It has new perspective to gameplay, it is 3rd person turnbased stratetgy ? or something like that. It has awsome style, and pretty nice setting. You will also encounter some pretty well written characters.  Highly reccomend to people searching for something refreshing.   Rating : 'I just got led around base by a pig.' - Welkin"
"It is definitely a good port with good story exploring the artifacts and the emotion of the characters! Like RTS? Like Turn Based? Give it a try, don't worry about the graphic or anime, you will like it"
This game is really fun its kinda like X-com the story is very good and gameplay is great. The charecters are also for intresting. i recomend any one who likes stratigy to buy and play
You play as a guy who talks to fish and keeps dad's tank in the barn.
"Play for the gameplay; the story is magical World War 2, only they think themselves clever for not directly calling it that."
"So glad I finally get to play this game! The port is very smooth, which was my biggest concern, I was very worried but it allows for 1920x and V-sync as well as allowing a FPS up to the refresh rate and there is no slow down whatsoever, load times instant, etc. Everything you'd want from a good port, sounds like they are learning from some of the past PC ports.  The gameplay is fun and fluid, albeit challenging - sometimes a wait and see approach is the best strategy and it is reminding me of the my days of classic turn bases SRPG's like Brigandine and Fire Emblem, but with a gorgeous look. The characters are likeable, and the story is mature despite the cartoon-y nature of the visuals. I'm at the beginning of the game but so far so good! Living up to all the expectation's I've had over the years wanting to play this game."
"This is one of SEGA's greatest titles. Epic battles with tanks and soldiers in an alternative history of Europe around WW2. This game has amazing gameplay and requires actual strategy to make use of your units effectively. One wrong step and you can say good bye to your forces and your chances of winning the scenario. Fortunately, the game is fairly forgiving in many aspects, so survivability shouldn't be too much of an issue unless you are just constantly rushing into things. The game has an amazing soundtrack, as well, with music very fitting to the scenes and battles. The mix of drama, storytelling, and battles is carefully balanced and it's really nice that you can go back and watch most of the story content at any time.  A tip to those who are having a hard time after chapter 4: it's a bit tough to do, but rank up your scouts to rank 2 or 3 and do the scouts challenge in the second page of the skirmish menu (yes, there's a second page). This will give a lot of experience points and cash for boosting your units, as well as an awesome rifle that dishes out tons of damage, despite it's short range. Running through this scenario a few times will allow you to increase the damage factor of your scouts and engineers, increasing their effectiveness in many missions."
"Valkyria Chronicles is one of the hidden gems of the PS3 that everyone should play. The graphics are beautiful, the story and characters keep it entertaining, the backdrop has been used often (WW2) in games but never from this sort of rural perspective. This game involves military cadets at a small country caught between two warring powers- but while you may be used to brawny, muscle bound CoD war machines, the characters in VC aren't so war hungry. They have weaknesses, fears and personalities all their own, and it hurts if they fall in battle.  The gameplay itself is both unique and fantastic, a major draw of the game. It uses a mix of turn based strategy and active movement- where you'll come under fire while moving, where cover like buildings, trenches and sandbags can really save you. You can sneak through grass- and each class has special abilities, such as scouts to spot those in grass, snipers which can't defend themselves but can take out enemies from a distance, and machinegunners which tear up close enemies as they run by on their turn.  VC is what a strategy game should be- strategic, yet quick paced with every movement and position and action having meaning, and mistakes being very costly.  I'll happily endorse Valkyria Chronicles as the best game of the PS3, and those who didn't have the chance on console should pick this up. (That is- unless you're waiting the HD version on PS4)"
"Unless you hate strategy or Anime style, its impossible to go wrong with this"
All the horrors of real war but with waifus
"So this is what you end up with when you go bat**** crazy with anime mods in XCOM.  The difficulty is a lot more forgiving however, and the movement system is weird as hell. You get a certain number of command points each turn and use them to move units.......but you can spend as many as you want on each unit. You end up going all Rambo with a couple of units and forgetting the rest. And don't get me started on that damn ranking system.  Still, it's a fun strategy game, and you get to save the not-jews from not-hitler so it's got that going for it."
"Good game! Strategy + FPS + cute characters XD, well too bad they have.....well 'not so good Graphic' Q.Q, soooo i recommend this game!  with 8/10 score!"
"This game is making me feel things I thought i'd never feel before, it's literally one of the best Strateghy RPG's ever, and it deserves all the love and acclaim it's getting on Steam, honestly, if you haven't played it before you're really in for a treat."
"Pros: -A Great Story (A typical Tale for a JRPG) -Amazing Artstyle (Everything is Drawn out and then shades to Sketches when someone dies) -A great port especially if you just hook up a PS3 Controller to your PC or Xbox controller. -Some pretty original Game Mechanics but nothing too impressive -Can switch between english and japanese voices  Cons: -There is no option to change the Difficulty for the game as a whole. (It's a Shame) -The games AI is rather simple, they move in a typical layout unless stopped by crossfire or stopped by the computed location as to where they were programed to move to.  (Meaning easy AI)     This game is one of those games you just have to buy.  Even if you have played it on the PS3 way back in 2008.   Strategic Gamers RPG Gamers JRPG Gamers Graphic Gamers Storyline Gamers Character Development Gamers (Emotions to each individual Character)  This game appeals to a wide variety of just about everything.  If you are familiar with the rather underatted games and such like the Tales of 'Series'  (Symphonia, Abyss, Graces F, Xillia, Etc) developed by Namco, and other simular genres then boy are you in for a treat!   If you are looking for a very challenging game strategic wise, I can't recommend this game you. You would be better off playing Civilzation V or Civilization Beyond Earth.   The missions are not so hard, as they are just hours long sometimes 4-6 hours especially when you are first thrown in and are getting the feel of the pretty basic AI an with no ability to change the difficultly from Normal - Hard - Advanced. You get the idea. It's not a hard game just a long one.   The storyline is a gem, that is all I will say, many tears were shed, many tables were flipped.  Get this game and experience it for yourself or go back to Call of Duty, and let the real gamers play."
"Good remake of Track and Field for the NES. Not sure why they set it in a warzone, but coaching your runner as they haul ♥♥♥ around tanks and Eastern-Europeans is great."
"I don't like the anime style characters nor the cliche storyline, but the gameplay is good. The UI is a bit clunky; this was clearly designed to be played with a controller and not with a mouse and keyboard. There are a ton of cutscenes called 'episodes' if you like that kind of thing. Since I don't care for the characters nor the story, I don't care for the episodes. Fortunately, they can be skipped. As for gameplay, this is a turn based tactical game in the vein of X-COM. If you enjoy that, then this will be right up your alley."
Best PS3 game(and I mean it) is now on PC!!!
"Shortened version: Pros -Side character designs, vices, and backstories are diverse and interesting -This is a good concept, even if it's horribly implemented.  Cons -This game is SLOW. There are a LOT of loading screens, cutscenes you need to go through, in game cutscenes you can't skip, dialog bits, and even waiting for the enemy to move takes a long time -On that note, you can't fast forward enemy turns. Minimizing pauses the game as well. -This is a strategy game with a HEAVY reliance on random number generation and probability. Many chances are a complete hit or miss--you either succeed or fail catastrophically. Some people also refer to it as a JRPG, but the RPG elements are very limited. -That said, the game is also horribly imbalanced. Many of the super difficult missions can be beat in a single turn by exploiting certain properties of your classes, while others can be beat quickly with a scout rush. The random aspect actually contributes to this. -Characters fail to come across as realistic. They feel almost there, but still a step away from human. Repetitive dialog doesn't help. -Plot has some decisions that are questionable or just stupid. The ending in particular is senseless (more on that below).  Full review:  Valkyria Chronicles seriously felt like a giant 30 hour sludgefest. As in I was slowly wading knee-deep in swamp.  Good god why would a strategy game rely on random chances and probabilities for 80% of its actions?  Why are there so many loading screens? Why are there so many goddam cutscenes that, even if you can skip them, you still need to load and watch a second of them first? Why are the credits unskippable?  Why is the dialog so long? Half the time it doesn't feel at all realistic. When characters interact, they usually reaffirm what each other said about 3 times, and they do it via repetition. (E.g., paraphrased: “Wow this bread is good! You should open a bakery!” After saying this like 2-3 times, instead of responding with “I’ve thought about doing so” or whatnot, the other character responds with something much more repetitious like “I’ve always wanted to open a bakery.” This is just paraphrased and isn’t word for word how it went.) Character interactions constantly feel a step away from human, which while it gets the point across, rarely feels genuine.  There was only one character death in the game that made me upset. The only other death I sympathized with wasn’t even a character with a name, nor were they an ally. The rest were anticlimactic, predictable, or just outright stupid. (”I love you so I’ll kill myself in a blaze of glory for your honor!” f**k my A-HOLE.)  The worst offender was at the very end, when you defeat the final boss. You literally have him about to surrender. He's disarmed, his super weapon’s been powered down, he’s weak and surrounded. Yet even one of your friends shows up and grabs him only to kill the bad guy in a suicide maneuver to atone for how he hurt you and and another team member earlier int he game AND IT'S SO GODDAM UNNECESSARY I'M ACTUALLY MAD. There was literally NO realistic reason for him to kill himself nor the final boss when they could’ve easily apprehended him. The icing on the crap cake? He kills them both by pulling the baddy-mc-badguy into a pit on board the carrier you’re on, which causes his deactivated weapon to explode, which causes the carrier to start exploding and basically screws the two main characters over. (GOOD JOB ATONING FOR YOUR DICKISH BEHAVIOR.)  Being an anime game of course there’s supernatural aspects, but it’s only ever used against you. One good character has special abilities, but they only show up in game context once for the first half of a single mission and you don't even get to control them at that time. That's literally it. It's a huge letdown--I would've LOVED to turn the tables and command a super soldier against an impossible objective. If they wanted it to be a plot device, they should've kept that in cutscenes only, not actually put it in a mission and not let you use it.  Gameplay wise I love the concept and attempt at the approach, but the reliance on random factors is maddening and outright stupid. The way the game is set up, either things will go perfectly, or they'll go horribly wrong. There is no in between.  So you wind up saving at a spot just to avoid watching the debriefing cutscenes, and the unit positioning, and the map-start cutscenes, etc. Probably the start of your turn, or right before a big play. Now you have to hope a perk you have will activate or your character won't suddenly develop Parkinson's and miss a nearly point blank shot, and when things do go wrong and you do absolutely no damage because of it, you'll reload. If you forgot to save recently, then prepare to watch all the cutscenes that played all over again since your last save, watch all the dialog bits, over and over and over again, until finally the RNG system stops jerking with you and you can move on.  Whether or not it works in your favor, because of the random aspect most missions you can just rush a full scout team and have them slip in and capture the objective. Balancing is non existent. There is no difficulty curve, just a probability curve. Skirmishes can be beaten in 1-3 turns via a scout rush. Campaign missions can be anywhere from as much of a cakewalk, or can be absolute bull difficulty unless you know how to exploit the class imbalance. (One 'difficult’ boss that can kill your units in milliseconds if you don’t have cover can be beat in a single turn with just a smoke bomb and 3 snipers. Another can be beat in a single turn just by rushing shocktroopers.)  Oh and of course, as you’re moving a unit around, if a perk activates randomly you’ll suddenly freeze and have a little mini-cutscene appear on screen as they say something gloaty, and then they get a perk to activate. Sometimes they can activate repeatedly during the same turn, btw. (Yay perk, boo WASTING MY TIME AND DISRUPTING MY MOVEMENT. One of Ted’s perks activated literally 3 times in a single move.)  The game has a horrible habit of also changing mission objectives on you at random, without warning. One mission has two tanks spawn on opposite ends of the map. The only way to beat this mission is if you knew in advance that these tanks were going to spawn, and you equipped both of your own with anti armor rounds so you could actually kill both of them.  My profile shows 30+ hours of play. About 40% of that was actually my gameplay. The rest was watching (and rewatching) cutscenes (some of which were unskippable), waiting for loading screens (there's plenty to go around!), and waiting for the enemy to make a move (even after they pulled some RNG bull and killed a key position of mine. Wanna restart? Too bad: you can't pause in the middle of enemy movement. You have to wait for their AI to tediously and meticulously finish. Even if they can easily kill you in their first move of their turn, they may decide to wait and finish you off during their last move.)  I like a lot of the side characters you can put on your squads for their designs and backstories, and I feel like this system has a lot of potential, but beyond that this game was incredibly frustrating and slow as crap.  I don't know why I bothered to finish this game. It was ticking me off for a while, and still does aggravate me."
"Ayy Yo dis sum gud sh!t. + Guns + Waifus + Husbandos + A$$ - Flat Chests + Flat Chests - Filthy Darcsens - Ayy yoo what the fug? that's racist nyagguh - shameful - disgraceful + Isara All in all, Real talk, naggreo,     It's Good."
"One of, if not THE, best games released during the last generation. Seriously, this game is absolutely amazing. Brilliant story, very unique and fun gameplay, a beautiful art style, and so much more. I suggest everyone buy it. Then maybe SEGA will finally understand the popularity of this franchise outside of Japan and localize VC3, then make a VC4 for PS4 and PC.  Dear SEGA: Also please make a Valkyria Chronicles 1-3 HD collection for PS4."
"Fantastic.  I've always been not-so great at RTS/Turn based strategies due to a tendency to turtle very hard, but Valkyria Chronicles is a very enjoyable game with its own little take on the genres. I never was able to play it on the PS3, but always wanted to.  Basically, it's like an anime based on WW2 (with enough of its own thing to distinguish it) with a great story, loveable characters, and really fun and addicting gameplay at the same time. (I would also recommend people play it with the Japanese audio, the English dub is pretty good but I feel as if they don't pull off the characters' emotions too well).  The game itself looks great, a sort of weirdish arcadey type of animation that fits perfectly, the musical score is really enjoyable, and all the little elements of the gameplay like the Word on the Wall and other bits of narrative like character profiles is really nice and adds to the already great storytelling.  One thing I must mention is how this game has gotten me attached to the non-main characters. Of course Welkin and Alicia are present and strong as the main characters, but the soldiers you can recruit from the HQ each have their own personality, looks, and backstory, and though the majority of my soldiers are female (c'mon, with a game called Valkyria chronicles there's no way I'm not gonna have my own version of a Valkyrie 7th Squad) I'm still connected with them and hearing them cry out when they die (which happens a lot with me lol) is painful, and I can never leave a soldier to die.  The medic system itself is very useful for that, and gameplay on the whole is refreshing and only really gets better as the game progresses due to upgrades to characters, etc. All the little perks your soldiers can get (I can never remember them and probably don't pay as much attention to them as I should), as well as their de-buffs are really nice touches, especially the 'hidden potential' stuff. Even little things like attacking amongst friends which creates an overwhelming hail of lead is super cool, but I tend to not take that into account due to my playstyle.  Honestly, buy the game, if you've read this far. Seriously. It's amazing, and I haven't even finished it.  Also Selvaria is badass I don't care what anyone says."
Like Fire Emblem with Guns 420/10 would bang hard
"I feel that my kawaii uguu army could stand to be a little more moe when they commit war crimes, but I am definitely enjoying the experience as is so far."
Killed a tank with a hand gun. Tank. Killed. With HAND GUN. WHO BUILT THIS TANK???
"Starts off as a pretty good turn base strategy game.  Set in a WWII like scenario. Weapons are semi-automatic rifles, machine guns, snipers, etc.  Starts off like any WWII scenario, some uppity empire wants to rule everything.  Pretty Fun.  Then a white hair anime chick shows up, starts glowing blue, and uses her laser lance to slay soldiers and tanks by herself on foot.  Game went full anime.  0/10"
"An anime art style game without, cat people, tentacles and cheesy boob characters. 10/10"
"Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing game. It displays a well developed combat system in which your orders lead you to victory or death; I've noticed that very little luck is involved. Squad customization and individual uniqueness of soldiers allows intresting styles of play. Knowing what your soldiers are capable of is very key, so make sure the order you give them is within their skill set. Planning ahead of time is also important; planning to hitting the enemy base from different angles is a lot more effective than last minute rushing into the bulk of the enemy force. The developers also did an execellent job blending story scenes with battle scenarios."
"An amazing mix of Japanese anime and European war story, with squad based tactical RPG thrown in for good measure. This was the only game on the PS3 I played through several times and loved every second of it, when I saw it on PC I just had to get it and have been trying to unlock every mission with an A rating (still in progress). But to recap if you enjoy a squad based tactical RPG with anime elements and a cheesy war story you won’t lose out with this purchase. The only negative I would have to say are the occasional glitches on the pc version that I never came across on the console, so save often to avoid disappointments on certain levels, thumbs up!"
Xcom + anime = a wonderful game  This title took me completely by suprise its just that good.  +story (funny and sad) +superb tactical gameplay +squadmates feel alive and have personality (fully voiced) +Alicia
"One of the absolutely best ports of one of the absolutely best games ever made. Gorgeous graphics, solid and unique gameplay, an incredible soundtrack, and a wonderful and emotionally gripping story. If you missed this gem on PS3, this is the perfect chance to experience it."
"I played half of the game in the PS3 version, and once I heard it was going to be ported as PC title I bought. So, this is a port of the aforementioned PS3 game, however, unlike other ports in Steam this is a good one. Controls might appear confusing at first due to some of the bindings, but you get used to them and if not you can remap them. Playing it with a control is optional too, but the keyboard/mouse combo was good to me.  The game is about a small country being dragged to a world war due to two superpowers crashing due to lack ragnite(it is a mineral they use for a lot of things, like the petrol for us) in their countries. This small country was invaded by the Empire because it is rich on that mineral regardless it's stance was neutral. This country is being crushed and you will follow the history of Lt. Gunther to turn the tide of the war to get rid of the invaders. It starts like a 'normal' war game but after some missions it gets some paranormal stuff(Valkyries), so if you don't like supernatural powers being involved in a 'normal' scenario, you are not going to like it.  The characters look like anime characters(which is fine to me and I like it!) and the game shows itself as it is a drawing, like reading an illustrated history book. If you hate this kind of stuff you will hate this game too. Every character has a reason to join the war, and while most of them aren't key to the history, the game still gives the player more information and details of them the more you use them.  The gameplay is given from a tactical map with turn based elements where you choose what units to use at the begining of a mission and what positions will they have (there use fixed slots, though). It is played by turns between you and the AI forces, begining always with the player's turn. You are given points to move your soldiers and do their things and once they ran out you are asked if you want to end your turn(you can end it at any time though, not necessary to be empty). When choosing a soldier, the game changes into a third-person perspective and when you end your turn you return to the tactical map.  Although the game uses turn based elements, if you ran in front of enemy troops they will fire to you(but if they, in their turn, run in front of yours they will be shot too!) because it is a feature of the game and can't be disabled. If you don't like your enemies in turn-based games to fire at you when it is not your turn, then you won't like it very much.  You can upgrade your units in two ways: getting better weapons and training them to incrase their stats. When you win battles, you earn cash and experience(sometimes there are enemy 'Aces' and if you kill them you get their weapons too) and that can be spent in new weapons or training respectively. You can also unlock some additional chapters with the cash earned through battles and let Welkin learn some stuff with experience points... although that comes a bit later into the game.  Between battles, the game shows you a lot of cutscenes that you can skip if you want, but I don't recommend if you want to follow the history being told... if you don't like watching too many cutscenes you won't like this game. This game doesn't have an autosave feature, but you can save anytime you want, even in the middle of the battle. If you were expecting all the released games feature autosave, you will be disappointed. I don't think it needs this feature to be honest.  I have heard a lot of people having problems with their PC and this game, but I haven't any issue so far, even before the patches were released. I play at 1080p with 60fps and I never had a single sound issue, sudden crash or ingame glitch. It also has achievements, but they are enabled after playing some missions.  In case anyone is interested, it features a 'New Game+' feature as well, carrying all your stats, medals, weapons, orders and money you had when finishing the game into a new game.  So, at the end it is a good game and one of the best ports of the year 2014. If you like all or most of the stuff described above, I recommend this game to you. If you dislike all or most of the stuff described here, you should avoid this game... because I can see you writing a complain topic in the community hub ;). You can also watch some people playing it too, that might be helpful."
i have no idea how i missed that game for so long ... i waited for a sale but i regret it now because this game is AMAZING it is totally worth teh full price! there are heroes form other games such as Vyse form skies of arcadia!  the art style and voice acting is perfect! the music is beautifull!  the only downside i found was that there is no auto save so be sure to save before and after every battle!
This game is great. Almost perfect.  Although the best part is totally where one mistake will make you fail a mission.  Yeah...that's a good one...
"My recommendation comes on the back of some pretty hefty reservations. First off: the gameplay is very fun. It earns my recommendation on that back of that alone. The game on its first playthrough is pretty challenging for first timers, and I assume everyone is a first timer since this combat system is rather unique.  Unfortunately there are some seriously bad things, especially for an adult audience. The combat has its fair share of unfairness. The AI can end turns a lot faster than you can, which means you get dinged by reactive fire and their units typically don't. One mission in particular had an enemy who was not only invincible, but could cross the entire map in one turn and would one-shot any soldier in their path. Typical JRPG 'cheese as challenge', but something one can expect from a distinctly Japanese game. The real downside is the cutscenes and story. It verges on interesting in several parts, but the characters and dialogue are often cringeworthy, borderline G.I. Joe PSA stuff, like 'eat your vegetables.' Sometimes I want to alt+F4 out of the game when I have to hear my Rambo Elite Scout Aisha who has more kills racked up than three special forces units combined complain about body insecurities or that one enemy soldier she couldn't help not five minutes after she shot 4 in the face at point blank range. The whole thing plays war like a game in Winny the Poo's Hundred Acre woods with characters whose status as unparalleled commando elites mass murdering whole armies is suspended every time a character needs to complain about their body insecurity or the horrors of a Darcsen labor camp... from a tank pilot who has literally killed human beings by running over them with a tank.  So yeah, it's a great game for the combat and the story borders on interesting if you can get over the insufferable anime tropes and cliches. If it comes up for sale, I'd recommend it."
"What a weird game, I vote yes on gameplay and no on the rest. Since you can skip most of the rest it comes down to a yes.  The combat is interesting and rather unique (some balance issues) the squad management is great (even if the menu navigation is a weird).  The setting is not bad either. Alternate history world war (although calling one side a loose federation of democratic countries and the other an authoritarian empire makes things very black and white), Lots of interesting backstory.   The characters are overly silly, but I can live with that as it makes them a bit more memorable and distinct (although lots of overused cliche anime characters among them).  The basic plot: battle for independence against a superior evil foe led by an underrated militia section whose leader is thrust to the front lines and is trying to get out of his fathers shadow to protect his sister etc. etc. Not bad actually now that I am writing it down and thinking about it.  Alas it does not matter though, since the storytelling is awful. vomit inducing. Everyone is silly happy cheerful despite all of the horrible ♥♥♥♥ supposedly going on. Even if it just happened like 5 minutes ago. I am not asking for realism in terms of science, just emotion please. All of the overused anime tropes aren't helping one bit either. Everybody seems completely out of touch with reality most of the time (by reality I mean their reality). Lots of 'Friendship will save the day' kind of lines.  So much is just ridiculous: The main character after being asked if he is going to sign up to the military says: 'no - being a soldier is not for me I want to be a teacher' which happened 10 mins after he killed 3 enemy scouts and saw several civilians killed for no reason in front of him, during an attack on his home town which basically was a declaration of war on his tiny country by an empire spanning half the world, oh and their tiny country has conscription, which is revealed 2 chapters later, I guess he forgot about that. Lets see, what else? The soldiers that shoot innocent civilians at sight yet somehow stop to explain to 2 people how they hate them and are going to kill them and don't do anything when one of them grabs a gun and points it at them. The general who is faced with impossible odds and yet seems to care more about lookign down on the militia and getting them killed than winning the war. The soldiers who are facing impossible odds and find time to be racist towards their own comrades and refuse to fight with them despite getting orders for going on a suicide mission the next day. The reporter who doesn't quite understand how government censorship works, luckily for her neither does the script writer.  I found the best way to digest the story was to be drunk and think of it as a 'so bad it is funny' kind of a comedy.  And that is all in the first 5 chapters, don't know when I will be drunk enough to continue.  PS: half your army is underage with one girl, a shocktrooper no less, being 12 years old.  It will cost me more in alcohol to play through this game than the actual game itself."
"If you want both a great story/characters and good gameplay, this is the game for you. Words cant describe how much I love this game and I am thankful for Sega for porting it to PC, otherwise I would of never expected it.   The year is 1935, you are the small independant country of Gallia in Europa. To the East is the Empire, an autocracy nation and to the west is the Federation. Both nations are at a 2nd world war with eachother and both nations depend on a rare material called ragnite for their needs. Gallia happens to have rich ammounts of ragnite in their soils, and thus The Empire invades the small country for this precious mineral.  You take on the role as Welkin Gunther, who is in love with nature, who is the leader of squad 7 in the Gallian malitia, from here you can customise who is in your squad, level up a certain classes with xp, learn special commands, read the news and upgrade your tank and weapons.  All the characters have their own personaility, rememorable and are fun to watch.  Art style for this game is beautiful and unique, everything looks like it came out of an pencil sketch  Music is fantastic, not a single moment I hated any of the music  The gameplay involves a tactical view of the area of operations, where you can see you whole squad on the map and any enimies in their line of sight, you then use CP (command points) to chose one of your soldiers to move and shoot within the same CP, tanks however use 2 CP. One of the cataches is that whenever you use the same soldier within the same turn, their movement speed decreases each time you use them.  Speaking of PC ports, the port is fantastic, runs at a constant 60fps, has keyboard and mouse support and feels great.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RidM5C1JbYw "
"A turn-based JRPG that makes you wonder......... How did WWII winded up here?  -Gallia = a small country surrounded by large fractions (I wonder what country was this during the WWII? celebrating feast of all spirits, Lion's paw flowers, etc... )  -Empire = a large country in the east that wants to take over all of Europa, the first to develop and employ tanks that later redefined and change the face of war, they also have a red insignia and concentration camps to sum it up. Hates darcsens.(Hmm... seems familiar...0_0)  -Darcsens = an indigenous race that has its own culture. a race that is being hunted down by the Empire.(Hmm... who are these people ?_?)  -Marberry shore = a beach that became a stronghold for the empire. The victory of the Gallians here marked the liberation of north Gallia. (There were so many beaches that day, let's call that day G-DAY)  -Atlantic Federation = a country from the west.(I did'nt even feel their presense in this war. But I like their APC tank that gave me a hard time chasing it :P)  Much of the games prefference is from that WWII. But with a little mix of Anime, RPG, TBS, PC Port and Chemical X..... voila!! This game was reborn!!!  A great game if you like animes and tactics alike.  Would recommend whether your Waifu likes it or not.    BTW..  I fixed my tank using a large scissor and healed my troops using a blue lightbulb. 8/10"
"This is by far the best Strategy-Turn Based game you can find on Steam. Gameplay is great. Story is good too.   Some people might not like the art the used, but this is an amazing game."
Great game
"First I need to say this port could have been made better, the interface does not support mouse and can only be navigated through my keyboard. I still can't fathom why Sega wouldn't do that because the interface is a mess and it would have been a lot simpler with mouse controls.  Valkyria Chronicles is a truly unique JRPG although I don't belive its the best. When I got this game I thought it would be a mixture of some of my favorite genres, Anime, Turn Based Tactics, Third Person Shooting, and WWII. However with all of that I still had trouble enjoying the game. Even though its not actually WWII, The anime aesthetic clashed with the war setting, after watching movies like 'Band of Brothers' 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Fury' I have an ingrained idea of war stories about soldiers going through very dark and traumatic experiences. But this anime style just clashes with that tone wheres there are far to many whimsical and cute moments so that whenever anything dark happens it’s simply gone over, then its back with the tales of love and friendship. I just simply couldn't associate this game's plot to WWII. But despite all of that I did find myself liking the characters and wanting to see where the story was going next with every level.  The game play was something that needed a lot more polish, don't get me wrong it WORKS I just wish Sega spent more time with this to refine the controls and mechanics. I hear far to many people compare this to X-Com Enemy Unknown and I disagree with all of them, I wish Valkyria Chronicles was more like X-Com, because X-Com is far better mechanically. Alot of the levels became trail and error for me because I was not really given good intel before I begin my operation. I would have liked locations to enemy bases better details on the terrain but I wasn't given much so each mission I sorta threw myself at it just to figure out what I was suppose to do. During my entire playthrough I found numerous glitches mainly with the tanks where's trying to move them (depending on terrain and camera angle) would cause them to vibrate and rapidly use up my movement points, however this can be prevented if you stop moving and recenter the camera. The infantry units all worked well and were easy enough to use, and there is a real novelty to filling up my squad roster with school girls and annihilating my enemies with them. The micromanaging aspect was a nice break between combat and had a decent amount of depth to it.   Overall Valkyria Chronicles is a decent game and if you're willing to tolerate many issues but nothing truly game breaking there is a decent game here. If there's ever a sequel to this I would very much like the devs to look at other turn based tactic games and implement better design choices. The story is ok for a JRPG I would have liked better character development, because almost all the main characters stayed more or less the same at the end of the story."
"It's a fun game, that is far more serious than the style and even some of the dialogue would have you believe. The artwork is absolutely beautiful, and it's a great SRPG, or TRPG, or whatever you want to call it. Hands down one of the best of its kind."
"Really good strategy game.  If you have played Fire Emblem before and loved it, this game surely is for you. Great gameplay, and really sweet features that make the game even better. Every teammember has different traits that give you dis/-advantages in the field of battle.  The story itself is very good as well.  Don't let the anime graphics scare you, I am not much into anime myself, but while playing the graphics are not very bothering.  I only wish the whole shooting sounds and animations were a wee bit better, but that is not that important =)"
"Amazing game. Get it. 'Nuff said.   Pros: The art style is awesome The game's strategy mechanics are great The characters are well-done  Not too easy or insanely hard; just the right level of difficulty The fact that characters don't immediately die when their HP reachs 0, but instead go into 'critical condition' and you have to rescue them within 3 turns or they die The level-up mechanics are cool Pigs with wings  Cons:  Sometimes aim is extremely annoying, like your Sniper missing 4 shots in a row Bosses are very difficult (Can be either a pro or a con, depends on the player though) Scouts and Engineers are too fragile  Snipers don't have a very large movement range  Overall, I give it a 10/10. Despite it's cons, it's an awesome game, plain and simple. If you're still not sure about getting it, go watch a video walkthrough or something. It's worth getting though :)  Now to wait for VC2 to come out here."
Great game. Tank controls made me want to jump out a window though.
Beautiful game. Translating the controls to the PC works pretty good; if you like alt-history and/or tanks and/or Japanese style games you'll want this. :)
BEST STRATEGY GAME EVER! &lt;3 IT'S.... IT'S JAPANESE GAME AFTER ALL! Nice intro and scenes  10/10.
It's good so far.
"I think one thing almost everyone loves about this game is the fact that every single one of the many characters feel individual, each with their own animations and strengths/weaknesses. Aside from the characters, the gameplay is fun and the story is strong. I also really liked the music, it's a shame there wern't more tracks.  However there are also problems with the game such as the port and the fact that it discourages slow strategic gameplay which which I honestly think is a huge mistake.  Regardless, if you like the genre and art style then you should really pick it up."
"Probably my favorite game of all time. Amazing story that engages you so well to the point where you'll play for hours without even noticing. I played this years ago when it came out on the playstation 3, and to this day it still holds its fun factor. 10/10 IGN"
"I cried in this game and also the anime ;_; 9/10 why not 10/10? because 1 you need is this game, BUY IT ALREADY WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!? T^T"
RIP - windmill
"VC 2 and 3 might be harder to port since they are PSP games but please, sir, may I have some more..."
"One of my favourite games from the PS3,now on PC!Can it get any better?If I know the modding community,yes it can!"
"The year is 1935. In Europa, the Empire declares war on the Federation, starting EW II. Because of its rich natural resources, the neutral nation of Gallia, is invaded by the Empire. Set in a loosely inspired WW II setting, you play as Welkin Gunther, a young Gallian University student fascinated by nature, who is drafted to the militia and made leader of squad 7.    As the story unfolds you will have to manage all aspects of your squad, from picking recruits, handling research to upgrade your weapons and equipment, to training your troops, among others.    The story is excellent with many twists and all characters being fleshed out, with complex backgrounds that end up justifying their personality and actions. Valkyria Chronicles is one of the few games that actually deals with heavy issues related to war, such as civilian massacres, concentration camps, ethnic cleansing, but portrays them in a mature way. Nonetheless it avoids being too heavy as you have the occasional casual moments with some respite between operations.    The combat mechanics are somewhat similar to XCOM. The battles are turn based, where you select your soldiers and control their actions. There are 5 different classes of infantry: scouts, shocktroopers, lancers, engineers and snipers who all have different roles on the battlefield, while Welkin uses his tank, the Edelweiss.    The graphics are simply stellar, as it uses an unique graphical style with the visuals looking like a moving watercolor painting. The soundtrack is also top class. Lastly there is a New Game + feature, where you can restart the story, unlocking some new features while keeping all your progress.    By far, one of the best games available on steam!"
"Imo Valkyria Chronicles is the best game on the PS3 and one of my 3 all time greats.  The art style is very special and i really like it. The game focuses heavily on the story and has a lot of cutscenes, if you don't like that, you probably won't like this game. But if you play games for the stories (as i do mostly) you can't really go wrong with Valkyria Chronicles, except if you hate Strategy RPGs."
"Let's start from the beginning. It is a wonderful game to play. Going in a World War 2 type setting. I for one love a game like this. From the combat setting to the difficulty, it is easy to understand yet still difficult. Overall, I just bought the game outright and love it. "
"War Is Hell. Nothing much else to add to that. except for it being absolutely true in this game. also racism Story is great. Gameplay is great. it's weird how enemies shoot at you non-stop when you move though. then again, the same applies for them when they move near my troops field of vision. ALL side characters have unique voices and dialouge (which is honestly damn amazing).   Should you buy this game? Do you like RPG's? Real Time Strategy Games? 3rd person shooting?  if you answered yes to one or more of the above. then yes you should."
"A great port of a great game. Was somewhat under rated being a PS3 exclusive, but truely deserves to be looked at now it sits on the PC.  Fantastic art style and solid gameplay."
Super strategy based game - Good story line and Immersive gameplay. It's a game if you played through it it's possible to start right away with a new game.  Only flaw - If you want to restart your mission you an't do it halfway it. You need to reload a save game and go through the cutscenes again.
"Ty Sega! #staybased this is truly an amazing game, one of the best from sega it has a great story with characters who will truly get you to care for them;Strategical battles with awesome gameplay."
"Fantastic game, well done story and characters. Along with a deep and unique srpg system that combines the best elements of many franchises."
"Awesome Game, where do I begin? Is it a WW2 Game? Somewhat.. Is it JRPG? Perhaps.. Sci - Fi? Abit of that as well. What is incredible about this game is that it somehow blends all of the above elements into a fantastic movie anime game. Smooth flowing graphics and music as well as in depth character build ups. It is a worth while investment.   Its also not as simple as it looks. Much strategy is required in order to play this well. Re started a few times just to get it right. Choose the right team and you might just do well..  Recommened. Looking forward to part 2."
"Prefered this over XCOM, probably because im a garbage weaboo. But hey, get your Lelouch on!"
"How should i say this, This game is like, X-COM only better, it have alot of ♥♥♥♥ing awsome Storyline a soldier of its personality, a Bootyfull Fictonal design which is amazing!, and none the less, HEAVY TANKS and ♥♥♥♥ing awsome prototype's!  The story line is juuuust soo ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, not to mention the VOICE ACTING,  i highly recommend this to anybody who likes WWII turn based Game but with Cute Anime girls and badass designs  120/100 Would Rekt again."
1- Addicting 2- Impressive game play 3- Excellent Story and characters  This is by far the best strategy game I ever played and one of the best games I played in general!  I hope we will see a new game from this series.
"Don't be fooled by my low number of hours on this game. I beat the game and all DLC on console and loved it so much that I decided to buy the port. The story (though a bit exhausting at times) is very good. I truly cared for some of the characters, and I actually made roster decisions based on who I liked personally in addition to their skill sets.  For the port itself, the GUI is a bit rough at times. It feels like something is missing as someone who spent so much time mastering it with a controller in hand. I will continue to sink time into this excellent offering, however as it is one of my all time favorite games."
"Great Strategy game! I am usually not a fan of strategy games but this game really hit the spot, in a way. The game drags you into it's story right at the start and makes you want to play it for hours and hours. I haven't had a game which made me want to play hour after hour in pretty long time so i'm loving this. The mechanics are easy to understand and fun to learn. I didn't buy it sooner since I didn't want to spend 20€ without knowing if i'd like it, but I bought it now because it was on a 66% discount. Having played it for a few hours (as of now) I do not regret it at all -- In fact, based on how much fun i've had up to now i'd be totally okay with paying the normal price of 20€.   If you're thinking about whether you should buy it or not then I say go for it, you won't regret it. "
"I've been wainting this game on PC since 2009. Only one of her kind, epic story, briliant characters, hours of interesting gameplay. Top tier jRPG, 10/10. P.S. Sega, you have to port VC2."
"The Art style is amazing + Characters are fun, quirky, and interesting + Love story is a little cheesy - Gameplay is intuative/ makes sense +  Never played the PS3 version, but who cares the game is awesome Amazingly fun stratagy game ( from someone whos not about that turn bases life)   It has all the fun of a stratagy game with the fun of any action game  10/10 would... *will buy a PS3 to play all 3 installments"
"Good for all the reasons others say, but only because it is a port of a game we might never have gotten to play. If it came out last week it would be trashed in reviews. It feels like playing a game with mittens on the controls (menu and in-game) are so bad."
worth every penny of it  good story  lovely style of animation really enjoy the game  and just recruit cute girls to fight XD  but why only one achievement after 12 hour game
"Weeb Nazis invade and it's up to Weeb Poland to stop teenage Weeb Hitler. Use your waifus effectively and fast and maybe the game will think you're cool enough to get an A rank. It's like X-Com, except not complete garbage and also for weeaboos."
Excellent port of a great JRPG/turn based strategy game. Loved this on my PS3 and I love it even more on my PC.  The controls are customisable (mouse and keyboard supported). Great game!
10/10 just for the intro alone.
"Great game, ♥♥♥♥ tank controls."
"An extremely well done port of one of my favorite games of all time. An incredible moving story with memorable characters and fun, strategic gameplay. Even the voice talent and soundtrack are top notch. It also stands the test of time very well. The port supports modern resolutions quite well and mouse support makes the game more enjoyable to me than the console version. Highly reccomended."
"A great Japanese tactical turn based game. I remember playing this on my PS3 and was the main game I missed after selling it. It's also a surprisingly solid port, looks great and runs great and at a bargain price. Highly recommended.  "
"This game is truly amazing. Valkyria Chronicles is a Turn-based Anime TPS with many different elements. It has a great story and character development, good graphics, skilled voice acting, an easy yet challenging combat system and much more to offer. This is the perfect strategy game if you're a fan of anime and manga. If you're not a fan of anime, this game could still be one of the best strategy games you've ever played. I recommend this game to the fullest. 10/10"
A must own game.  Everything is perfect with no issues what so ever.
"Another great ps3 exclusive comes to pc, we need more like this."
This is a beautiful game. And one unlike anything I've ever played before. The art style is incredible. The level variety sets a standard for every other game. The story is really well told too and will keep you coming back even when it gets mercilessly hard. And it keeps all of this up beautifully paced for 30-50 hours.  The control have been miserably converted for PC but that's still well worth putting up with to experience the game. 4/5
"I definitely have mixed feelings about this title...  Game mechanics themselves are almost flawless, you get to enjoy deep in-field combat tactics and EVERY unit (not only unit types) has its uses on the battlefield. Also, this title is almost entirely plot driven, halfway from a game, a visual novel and an anime itself; and I have to say that the plot is actually quite good (if you like anime-like dramas). Last but not least the graphic engine is awesome, 3D models become amazing pastel-colored line-art sketches with a marked anime style.  So why do I have mixed feelings about this game? The port lacks settings customization (there are NO anti-aliasing settings for example) and in-engine cutscenes are pre-rendered in 720p (or even less) and extremely aliased; why pre-rendering cutscenes made with the game engine? and why on that resolution without anti-aliasing? If cutscenes played a marginal role in the game I would have not been disappointed much, but since most of the game time is actually spent watching cutscenes I really can't comprehend the choice, not to mention that this also made the game extremely fat download-wise (~10GiB instead of probably 2~3GiB).  Mixed feelings aside I have to say that this game is still really good and extremely enjoyable so I'd like to recommend it to all turn-based combat games enthusiasts and to all romantic/grand-strategy anime fans."
"Loved the game. Is quite different from the most games around, the story is rich and the characters are very interesting, the turn system is great, the cinematics and the book system will drag you to a whole new experience in gaming. I would like to congratulate the developers of this game for the great effort put in the animation; it is like being part of an anime. Thanks."
"Great storyline, battles are a bit slow in beginning but once you get the hang of the game, strategy to beat it in as few turns as possible is where the challenge comes in.   Worth it!"
I really enjoy this game. worth it 10/10
"Sega should give up on Sonic and focus on this. This storyline is a little too jrpg for me, but if you can survive Kingdom Hearts, you can survive this. Shooters can mix with TBS."
i HAVENT EVEN BEEN PLAYING THIS FOR LONG AND IM ALREADY HOOKED! been a long time sence iv seen a good turn base strategy game. got a good heft story line. and a geart history. i hightly recomend this game to anyone whos looking for somthing new!
Valkyria Chronicles is a very good RPG. It's innovative and refreshing. Original style and gameplay. Highly recommend this game to those who want something unique.
A great game. Beautifully animated.
"+ Excellent voice acting + Interesting and exciting new spin on turn based battles + Cool anime like graphics + Nice mix of unit classes, each with it's strengths weakness and extreme usefulless in the proper circumstance + Story is nice, though highly predictable + Fully fleshed out game world, multiple characters with their own backstories + It's a console port but the controls are acceptable  - A few bugs here and there (one of my characters fell through the ground though this only happened once), it's nothing too serious though - Most maps have one 'best way' to beat and once you discover it there's really no point in replaying the map. In some of campaign/story missions there's only one possible way of winning and the game 'cheats' to prevent you from going of the scripted path.  All in all a pretty decent game, even at full price it's clearly worth it."
"To be honest I was not sure if this game was worth buying or not, but I am confident to say it was well worth it. I saw the anime, and found out there was a game of it.  The story so far as I played(I played up to chapter 6), is exactly the same as the anime.  It is a both good and bad thing. If you watched the anime, you know what is going to happen and you are pretty much spoiled. If you havent watched the anime... i think you will find it kind of hard to keep up with the story, because you are not sure which characters are important to the story and which are not, but i think you will enjoy the story over all.  Gameplay, is kind of unique. It is a turn-base strategy game, but things can really change depending on the live input you putin to each action because the enemy will attack you while it is your turn to move characters.  Well, it makes sense, In real battle, the enemy wont just sit there and let you come in to their face and shoot them.  The biggest plus of this game is that you have a some-what control over aiming the guns of your units instead of praying that RNG will roll in your favor. but of course, the farther away from your target, the harder they are to hit, so I always find the need to get really close to my enemies to do significant damage... but that maybe because my units are still low level and my weapons are not that upgraded.  Yes, I did mention levels and weapon upgrades. in this game, you get to train your units and research upgrades for your weapons.  leveling is pretty simple, you gain experience points in battle, you go to the training grounds and spend experience on the class of units you want to level up. Although when I was first told that I have to level up a whole class instead of individual units, i thought the developers were being lazy, but then i noticed the number of units you have at your disposal and the fact that units could die, and be never used again, I came to the conclusion it was the right choice by the devs. Weapons upgrade is similar proccess. You gain development Points in battle and you spend them in the R&amp;D. From what I have seen, it seems like each weapon has loads of upgrades that could be done on them, and you can definitly feel the upgrades getting applied in battle.  What I didn't like about this game was the fact that you pretty much need to grind 2-3 levels to gain enough surviveability in between each chapter... it kinda derails you from focusing on the story, which is pretty enjoyable.   I rate this game 8.5/10(because of the forced grinding, and the fact that i watched the anime before i played the game)"
"It's about WWII, a twist of WWII. You're up against the Empire, which represent German in WWII, as a tank commander of a small nation. Stories are lighthearted and half-serious. Main characters are charming and unique in their own way. If you're a fan of anime/VN this might surprises you. The artstyle is superb, kind of Studio Ghibli, although dated and limited to 720p as it's an old PS3 port. A handful of anime seiyuus had their roll in this game. Have fun recognizing them(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ The game is charming while always able to move you with the plot. 10/10"
"My 2 favorite things, anime and videogames. This game takes both and smashes together turnbased strategy game. Amazing with its nice artstyle and  hyper realistic character ragdoll physics , all backed with a great story. Solid gameplay that even some non strategy game players would like. I prefer to play on japanese because I like their voices alot better. A great game for a great price.  10/10 would step on a mine again!"
"Great story, interesting setting, variety in characters, great character development, amazing soundtrack, very enjoyable strategic gameplay. If you like RPGs, you owe it to yourself to play this game."
"An excellent turn-based strategy with RPG and 3rd person shooter elements, created in a beautiful art style. Lots of replayability due to the diversity of soldier potentials (abilities), and skirmishes/ NG+ let you test tactics to your heart's content. If you're used to taking your time in TBS (as I am in games like XCOM), fear not the 20-turn limit. You'll learn to confidently advance on objectives and prioritize targets in a timely and thoughtful manner. Every soldier has a back story and hidden potential, both revealed the more you use them. I found myself taking seemingly terrible soldiers on mission just to find out more about them!"
"A flawless port of the PS3 Classic with a few PC bonus's.   Porting to the PC means you get mouse control for aiming and with a nice sensitive mouse, you can make quick turns but the precision hits.   Same in gae layout of the PS version, storybook advancing and what not.  If I had to pick one issue, its that the save menu is still manual. No auto-save after each story advance / mission. But thats how it was on the PS3 and it worked.   All in all, 10/10 for the port. Someone at sega finally earned some coin."
"TLDR: If you enjoy tactical turn-based gameplay with squad customization and character advancement, and you find the visuals appealing and aren't put off at the prospect of an animu-style storyline, give Valkyria Chronicles a go.    Valkyria Chronicles is an old (2008) PS3 game that was ported to PC in November 2014. It tells the story of Welkin Gunther, son of a famous general from fantasy Europa's World War One equivalent. As a citizen of the tiny duchy of Gallia, situated between two continental superpowers: The Atlantic Federation and the East Europan Empire. When Gallia is attacked by an imperial army, Welkin is drafted into the country's militia, taking command of a squad of soldiers which he leads from the Edelweiss, a tank piloted by his adopted little sister. The game's storyline follows squad seven's struggles against the invading imperials, whose invasion in turn seems to be connected somehow to the myths of the Valkyrur of old.  The game's characters are colourful, in most cases charming and likeable, but many members of the core cast can come across as a little cliched or over-the-top. Story-wise, it's good, but not great. There are some twists and turns along the way that I really didn't see coming, but the overall impression is brought down by the often fairly cheesy anime dialogue. The ham-handed way the game presents racism against the black-haired Darcsens is a good example of how an attempt to portray complex social and ethical issues doesn't work well when you're only really painting in black and white.  Gameplay-wise, this game succeeds with a few bumps. Battles are split between a top-down tactical view where you select which units to activate, transitioning the game to a third-person view where you get to control characters and tanks individually. Each turn, you receive a limited number of command points that can be used to activate soldiers and issue orders (single-turn boosts to various unit stats, or other indirect benefits) from the tactical view. Each activation lets your unit move and fire or perform another action. The different unit classes have different strengths, weaknesses, equipment and abilities, from scouts that specialize in fast movement and spotting enemies to engineers that can clear mines, repair vehicles and restock ammo.  In general, this recipe works well for providing interesting tactical puzzles to overcome. Many challenges promote or require unit cooperation and combined arms tactics. However, the AI is generally lacking in sophistication beyond predetermined simple scripting, and beyond killing soldiers left hopelessly out of cover and such it generally fails to do much productive during its own turn. The gameplay style favoured to achieve 'A-Rank' on the various missions (which depends solely on speed and no other parameters) tends to be dependent mostly on rushing a few soldiers forward as fast as possible, taking out special enemies along the way while completing the objective in a low number of turns. This emphasis on speedrunning in terms of what rewards you get from each mission somewhat hampers the overall enjoyment.  There are other bumps in the road as well. The tanks move a little differently than infantry, spending movement points both when moving and turning. This might not be such a problem if they didn't have a tendency to spin around and jitter a lot, potentially draining all your movement very fast, owing to small glitches and a very awkward control scheme. The consequence is that you'll probably often just leave your tank parked in the deployment zone for the duration of many battles. Other sources of frustration include the fact that you cannot bring up the ingame menu during the enemy turn, which means if you realize you made a critical mistake you're forced to watch the entire sequence of enemy movement before being able to reload. Sometimes, I found it faster just to alt-f4 rather than wait for the AI to finish.  As a final note, I'd like to say I enjoyed the visuals throughout the game. Some people might not like the style, but if you take a look at the preview pictures you'll get a good indication of whether this is for you or not.   PROS: - Pretty visuals - Engaging tactical puzzle gameplay - Plentiful challenge in the DLCs - Colourful cast of characters - Solid story  CONS: - Issues with the port (tank movement, console-ish controls et al) can cause frustration - Poor AI - A-ranks only based on speed, tends to depend on reloading a lot to pull off difficult shots to be feasible - DLC weapons can screw up campaign balance   Overall, the game gets my recommendation. It's a game I was frustrated with at times, but one I also enjoyed a lot and ultimately found satisfying."
Makes child soldiers seem cute  10/10
"This is one of the finest games I've played in a long time. Good, solid story and characters. The setting is enjoyably simple and interesting (Well thought out lore, unique weapons with weapon info, character profiles, medals/awards, culture etc).   The part of the game outside of the story is a very unique blend of turn based strategy and first person action. You start with a set amount of command points that can be increased based upon the characters you're fighting with (some are better leaders then others). You can give specific orders (buffs) by using these points or take direct control and move a character.   The missions are -challenging- even for a veteran of strategy games. Expect to play them a few times and to be wow'd when you figure out a winning strategy/trick.  The level up system in the game is also enjoyable and rewards people who like to spend ample time having the best/strongest troops they can get.  Great game. Well worth the shekels."
"Tactical RPGs are rare in today's gaming climate. Interestingly enough, it's one of my favorite genres. If you're like me and have been wanting a current-generation Final Fantasy Tactics or Tactics Ogre for years now, give Valkyria Chronicles a try. It tries something bold and new with its third-person shooter style gameplay, but incorporates a large portion of the depth and tactics that make the genre riveting.  The PC port is good, but not perfect. The graphics haven't been overhauled, it runs relatively well, and has solid controller support.  I should mention that I beat Valkyria Chronicles on PS3 before playing the PC port."
"Good game to play, though missions can take a long time to complete. You cannot speed up enemy turns in this game. Another great thing about this game is that it will make you think, well for me lol :))  Sadly, the start menu can be a little annoying, but you will get the hang of it"
I played Valkyria Chronicles 2 on psp and i loved it. I finally got to see how good its predeccesor was and man i was not dissappointed. This game is a fantastic strategy with lots of challenge. It also manages to tell a cool story aswell. if ur a single player gamer who likes to sink their teeth into a deep meaty game for hours then Valkyria Chronicles is the game for you
"Loved this game on the PS3 so I rebought just to have in my library and support SEGA's porting of awesome games to PC. Didn't really intend to play, but that being said I've already pumped about 12 hours into this game in a matter of a few days.  This game has a nice anime-artistic feeling to it with its cell-shading animation; the cutscenes aren't all that great since like everyone says, they are the original 720p port from the PS3, however, gameplay is smooth at my setting of 1080p 60fps.  As far as gameplay is concerned, if you are a fan of turn-based strategy/war games, this is a must have game. The first ever strategy game that I loved was Final Fantasy Tactics, and to me, I'd say this gameplay is on par with that. Though the mission rating system is somewhat bogus, and theoretically you'd have to Scout rush to get the highest rating. However, beating missions on first playthrough without caring about rating gives a feeling of great satisfaction.  The story is heartfelt and warm; some parts may seem childish or stereotypically anime-like, but the themes and character develepment kept me entrenched the first time I played this game years ago and even now as I replay it. That being said, I do hope publishers realize the potential of eventually porting more 'exclusive' games to PC. "
"The attractive love child of Fire Emblem and Battalion Wars. And so pretty too, it's pretty much Watercolour Borderlands"
"(Honestly I was going to review this once I finished the game but due to tests, reports, SAT classes, and life in general I have had no time to even relax to play games, it also doesn't help that I screwed up my save file a couple times. I will probably finish the game once hell freezes over at generous estimates. The only relaxation I have had is me sitting and listening to OK Computer, Pinkerton, In Rainbows, or Toxicity for the 200th time while doing all these things, just keep this in mind when reading this review)  This game is a very underrated JRPG, overall JRPG's, especially on the PC platform, has been saturated with some of the most basic of basic tropes and at this point the only thing it takes to make a good jrpg on PC is to slap some ♥♥♥♥, and copy paste some random popular jrpg that are either on handhelds or consoles. I am happy to say the Valkyria Chronicles does it's own thing and does it pretty well, and it has some tropes which can at times take me out of the experience, it isn't as bad.  The game is a Turn Based Third person shooter, much along the lines of XCOM Enemy Unknown. The shooting mechanics work for what they are and enemies can shoot at you during your own turn which forces you to think on your feet, there are many times where you are given an objective and you will have to figure out what will be the best and most efficient way to finish the objective. There are a total of 5 classes, Scout, Shock Trooper, Lancer, Engineer and Sniper. Scout can run the longest and can shoot at medium-long range, ShockTrooper run faster but not for too long, they weild a machine gun and can shoot at close-medium ranges, they can also take a lot of damage. Lancer is strictly used for taking out tanks, or, depending on how you build them, can be used to take out soldiers as well. They can take the most damage. Engineer is one of the weakest of the bunch but can run at a decent distance and can repair anything, they also can heal the most and have 3 gernades. The Sniper is the weakest, but the hardest hitting against troops, their pretty self explanatory, you snipe people. The classes are *MOSTLY* balanced and each one bring something new and fun to the table. Be careful though since you can permanantly kill them off so you must make sure you have a plan.  There is also loads of extra content such as Reports, DLC (haven't played all of them, will not be included in this review), and secret unlockables which bring out side stories of major characters as well as some minor. This is something I think the game does very well, characterization, every major character, and some minor ones, have their own backstorys and their personality, some characters at first seem dickish and mean at first, but when doing these reports you start to understand why they do it and they usually end up realizing their wrongs in the end, this is amazing character development and what brings out the best of this game to me, you feel for everyone and while you may not agree with how a character does something, you understand why. Even the enemy side isn't simplified as 'oh bad guy kill kill we hate kittens' the enemy side does do terrible things, but it the game reminds us that the people have their reasons why they are in the war, and the reasons are justifiable for the most part. The game also has beautiful art direction and it is something that can only work in 3D for me, the anime simply does not do it justice.  The story so far is also engaging, although keep in mind this is not a gritty WWII style game, it has it's serious moments but it is mostly not as serious as yo would think it is, this is not much of a problem for me, but I understand why people would be put off by animeish tropes being inserted into a WWII setting. but overall it is a very engaging story. I also liked it's references to WWII such as concentration camps and references on Trench Warfare, it's little but it kept me engaged in the story.  Now for the problems, the game isn't perfect of course. For one thing it plays more like a puzzle game than a strategy game, as you will find yourself trying to figure out what the devs wanted you to do in order to get that A rank this isn't a problem for me right now since for my 1st playthrough i don't really care for ranks as much unless it is an extra or report mission, but it is a problem. Also despite many of the characters being fleshed out, many of them also aren't at all. Many of the characters I do not have a emotional connection to at all, the only thing is I can say is 'well this dude/girl looks cool i guess, and their attributes work in my favor so i like them.' so when one of them fall, unless they are units I use often, i don't particularly feel anything. Another problem is the difficulty spikes, they are everywhere they go up and down and it is really jarring. For example the Batomys battle is legit the hardest mission in the entire game, but it is like chapter 7. Then there is battle at Naggiar 2 which is also incredibly difficult, but the very next chapter is legit the easiest mission in the entire game. There is simply no flow to how the difficulty increases. I also mentioned how the classes are MOSTLY balanced, well, that's only initially. Once you reach mid-end game you realize how OP scouts are and how insane some of the orders are, Mortar Support being the most broken order as well as Caution mixed with defense order, as well as Penetration. And Scouts with defense order + caution are tanks, especially if that tank is Alicia, during late game she might as well be invinicible at that point. these completely break the game. There are also times where AI will simply glitch out or be incredibly stupid. like the enemy will sometimes get their snipers to constantly move back and forth and do nothing for no reason.  Also last thing, Worst Report is R&amp;R literally the most cringe worthy thing I have ever witnessed in a video game and it costs a whole lot of in-game cash too. why was that even made is beyond me.  Overall the game is pretty great, later games do improve on these aspects, or so i have heard, so i hope they port them soon. I suggest you get the game at full price if you can to support the devs. It is well worth it."

"Definitely that, 'wow, this is absolutely amazing!' kind of game."
"Well, I haven't done this ♥♥♥♥ in awhile. This chair feels different. Where all of these buttons here the last time I made a review? Jesus the Christ, are those cupholders? Anyways, to the review.  Don't let the fact that I'm recommending this fool you. To put it lightly, this game is the biggest disappointment I've ever played. But my opinion isn't as cut and dry as that.   So, why would I be recommending this game to the people I meet from now on? Well, for one I would do it for a laugh because I'd ask to be present for every chapter of this game that the person plays; some of the reactions to this game that people have told me have been hilarious. However, this game is still kinda interesting and fun when you actually get to play. Despite the fact that this is the Gaming Industry's version of 'When Keepin' it Real Goes Horribly Wrong'.  Usually when I look back on a game I think about it in the perspective of whether or not it fulfills my made-up triphecta of Graphics, Story/Setting, and Gameplay. But I'm not looking back on this game. In fact I've barely started and I can already formulate a pretty good idea of what this game is. The game has fun gameplay that is challenging and rewarding for the most part, and it has a 'beautiful' art style and every tank and piece of equipment is very creative and on the most part extremely detailed. The reason this game has in my mind become such a giant sink of potential and human dreams is in the Story.  Before I take the horse to the glue factory, allow me to feed it some well deserved apples. First off, the gameplay was surprisingly exception for a kinda experimental idea. Or atleast it seems experimental because I've never seen a Turn-Based-Strategy game that played like a Third-Person-Shooter. Basically, you will be dropped in a small-ish combat zone usually with the objective of taking some flag-pole from the enemy like this is the world's most intense game of Capture The Flag so that you can either further your territory on the map or you just kinda win.   You're given a group of soldiers to fight out your battle along with a fully controllable tank that would put a King Tiger to shame if it didn't control like a bull having a seisure on the top of the Chicago Space Needle. Your troops come in five distinct flavors: Scouts who scout, Stormtroops who storm, Snipers who snipe, Engineers who engi...thing, and Lancers who...wait. ♥♥♥♥ing Anti-Tank LANCES!?  That's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, how could they have ♥♥♥♥ed this game up so ba...nevermind.  The way you move and control these units is what makes this game note-worthy. Instead of just ordering a simple 'You're here, now go there. Once there shoot 'thing-A'' kinda of mechanic, you actually control the unit like you were playing an awesome kinda of Third-Person-Shooter. You start with a set amount of points that act as an action a single unit can take. Select a unit, spend a point and then you're off. You have a set amount of walk-juice you can use per turn, but you can use multiple points for multiple attacks. Add some stuff like environment interaction and destruction, and you have a fun base for a game.  In addition, the art-style for the game is pretty unique for a game of its kind. Its kinda cartoony and bright along with a strange sort of drawn look for everything. However all of the characters, vehicles, and equipment is very creativly drawn. Like seriously, this stuff looks like someone let Mad-Max into the motorpool.  Its awesome, where did this game go so so so SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ WRO...ahem.  Ok, screw being nice now. The story for this game had a good, if alittle overused setting. Two toughest countries on the block go to war and your country is caught in between. You're character, Welkin Gunther doesn't want this ♥♥♥♥ing war. He just wants to look at bugs. Yea, thats right. ♥♥♥♥ING BUGS. This is your hero. But lets disregard that. This supposed warrior poet doesn't want war, but he's kinda good at it if he would stop staring at the bird and monologing all the damn time.   In fact, all of the characters do that. Its bad enough that each character falls into a happy little niche' of a cliche', but its like these guys were written by space aliens and all of the motion capture was done in the Uncanny Valley. These people one minute are scorning the very act of war. Woe is the man/woman/kid that is fighting in this war for some reason and has to kill people monologe monologe mono-♥♥♥♥ing-loge. The next minute they off a guy and give a very anime 'Yay!' afterwards. Its such a conflicting ♥♥♥♥ing conflict of human personality that they all at one point cling to their given niche' like its the mast of a sinking ship to the point that they seem like line-spewing robots. Feel-bad speech activated.  You may say, 'But Screwby, you overbearing ♥♥♥♥♥-thingy, how could just the dialogue and story bring down a game?'. Well then, go ahead and play it. And watch all of the cutscenes. Do it. I dare, I double dare you to do it. In fact, lets raise the stakes. Watch them all in a youtube-movie compilation. I'm pretty sure you can find showings of it in the inner-most circle of Hell."
The worlds greatest japanese WWII inspired turn based RPG shooter strategy anime ever made!
"This game is one of the best games I have ever played. I picked this game up on sale for $10, and it was the best $10 i've spent. Even when it's not on sale I would recommend this game. My first look at the game; I was kinda unsure about if it would be good or not, but I feel like it was amazing after I have played it. I didn't know about the JRPG, Anime game style, but it turned out to be great. When I first got into the game, I was stunned from how great everything looked. It was beautiful. Everything looked so pretty down to the grass on the ground.  The Characters in Valkyria Chronicles are so great. Every single one of them in their own way, whether it be that they are cool, nice, kind, or if they are cold hearted, hateful, or jerk. The two protagonists of the game are: Welkin Gunther, and Alicia Melchiott. These are my favorite characters in the game, because of there background (SPOILER ALERT) their romantic relationship formed throughout the game. Welkin Gunther is a man in hie early 20s, that gets dragged into a war. Welkin is drafted into squad 7 as a lieutenant, who is also a tank commander of the tank Edelweiss. He is in love with nature, and wants to become a teacher. Alicia Melchiott is a woman the age of 19 who was formaly a baker, who later on got drafted into squad 7 as a sergeant, because of her role in the Bruhl town watch. There are also other main characters such as Largo Potter, Brigitte Stark (Rosie), Isara Gunther. Which are all awesome characters with good storys behind them.  As far as game play goes, I would say that it has its ups and downs. But every game has that. I like the Third Person view when controling your character. The only think I dislike is that you can't see from the enemys eyes, when they are in view. I really like how you level up classes instead of leveling up one individual at a time. In my opinion that can get really annoying.  Some advice when playing this game - Level up scout first. They are the best unit in the game - Another note on leveling up. Get every unit class to elite rank before you get one to level 20 - Save after every turn if you're unsure about how to win the battle - Make many saves - Don't let your units die!  I rate this game 10/10"
"If you like Anime or Manga, you have to have this!"

"I already had this game for ps3, but ps3 sucks )"
"'A good game.' - Swanson, Ron"
"Valkyria Chronicles is one of those games that you hesitate when buying, but when you start it up, you can't really stop. The whole concept of the game is done remarkably well, as the mechanics and engines make the whole experience unforgettable. When you start listening to the awe-inspiring music, you find it to be so diverse and interesting that you never actually get tired of it, not to mention the graphics seem to fit in place beautifully with the music. Running the game, you will find that there is limited lag. (As long as you aren't running fullscreen-resolution) If I were to compare this port to the original PS3 version, I find that the game comes easier with the DLC, but the tanks themselves tend to me quite buggy... Anyways, if you are looking for a turn-based, strategy RPG with tactics similar to Fire Emblem and XCOM, I highly recommend playing this game, as it is definitely worth it."
The only realistic anime game ever. Rest in piece everyone I killed in this game becausee im a awful tactitian.
"Suprisingly deep yet touching militia story, great characters with unique personalities, pretty art style and namable soundtrack make this game hands down one of (if not the) the best jRPG I've played so far. If you're into tacticts, try this one, you won't be disappointed.   Oh, and one more thing. 貴方の静かな微笑み 故郷から届いた温もり 同じ夢をきっと見てた *salutes*  Now we need both Valkyria Chronicles II &amp; III ported on PC."
"Whoever had played the original PS3 version, this is a superb port and worth the price. If you never played VC and love tactics games, this is a obligatory title, if you are not a fan still worth. So, BUY THIS NOW!"
"CONS: - not overly strategic, getting the best ranking on missions sometimes just involves rushing the enemy base, not really making smart choices. I wish it rewarded actual tactics (like XCOM) - mediocre cover system - tons of cutscenes and dialogue in between missions - linear story (lack of choices/options)  PROS: - tons of cutscenes and dialogue in between missions - tanks - headshots, headshots, headshots - japanese voice acting - animu waifu"
"Fantastic story and great combat system. Wether you like JRPG or not, this is an enjoyable experience you might want to check."
"It's a very unusual squad-based tactical combat game. No squares or hexes? Heresy. ;)   Gameplay:  Depending on the mission you might be controlling as few as one or two named characters and a couple of generics, or deploying as many as nine or ten (often including at least one in a tank).  There's a command point system. One command point is required to activate a character, which shifts into a third-person 3D view where you can run around (limited by action points, depending on unit class and also reduced a lot if this isn't the first time you activated the character that turn) and attack (once, although you can keep moving afterwards if you still have AP). Action is *mostly* frozen while you're active, but enemies who spot may shoot at you (and you them, on their turn). Time stops when you initiate an attack so you can aim (enemies have weak points; for humans its the head, for tanks it's the glowing radiator at the back) or look around without being shot at until you abort the attack or go through with it.  CPs are also expended for giving orders, which can provide various bonuses and benefits. Some are extremely situational, while others can be quite strong.  All the characters you manage have a class (Scout, Shock Trooper, anti-tank Lancers, Snipers, Engineers); some visible stats (action points, health), some invisible ones (damage resistance, accuracy); personal potentials (traits, not always positive, which manifest themselves as you make use of the character) and battle potentials (traits, always positive, revealed and activated as you level up a class).   Completing missions yields XP which you use to level up classes rather than individual classes, or to learn additional Orders. The monetary rewards ('ducats'), are expended to research improvements to your equipment. The faster you complete a mission (turns, not real time), the higher the grade and rewards.   Story:  Unusually heavy story line for this sort of game... in fact, navigation through the game is largely in *Book Mode* -- you're paging through a history book telling the story of your militia squad. The characters you control *all* have biographies that get revealed as the story progresses, and the story is told through numerous cut-scenes between combats.  It's sometimes sweet and fluffy, it's sometimes brutally tragic -- there's both scenes of love and happiness, and of devastation, slavery, and slaughter; of friendship, and treachery. I found it unusually well done for giving purpose and context.   Miscellaneous:  Game is set up to allow farming, via skirmishes -- replayable battles outside of the main campaign, but unlocked as you progress.  Art style is gorgeous, and not terribly demanding -- I was running it on a laptop w/ a Quadro 2000M. It's a PC port of a game that was on a Playstation, so this isn't too shocking.  Voice acting is pretty decent, if you consider that the characters are mostly ordinary young people, not professional soldiers. When one character sounds like a Valley Girl exclaiming 'Well, DUH' after she shoots dead an enemy, it's because she's *supposed* to be an 18-yr-old more interested in trends and fashion than, say, Clausewitz and Sun Tzu.  Includes all DLC from the original game.  Some bugs related to high frame rates; locking to 30fps is recommended."
"I played it on PS3. Unique game, there was nothing like that on PC. I also expect that keyboard+mouse would be better for it."
Valkyria Chronicles : Definitive Edition
Loved it on my Playstation... Loving it on my PC. Long time since i've played this. But Valkyria Chronicles is and will always be a Masterpiece of its own. If you played and liked the Console Version you should get this. But also if you're new in this World it's really worth a try! The Story is awesome and you can feel inside it sometimes..^^  Valkyria Chronicles stands here and is shiny like never before!
"My game crash after assigning my squads in chapter 3 :( anyone know what is wrong? Other than that, it is a great game:)"
"Awesome game! Great storyline, great characters, great gameplay and an unique art style. Nothing left to be desired.  I am in love."
"Awesome game! There are not too many PC game with such beautifull voice acting (in Japanese). If you like a good story with thoughtful gameplay akin to xcom:EW but with more charm, this is it. :) SEGA did an awesome port."
"Amazing game. Really, just buy it."
"Very good port, supports above 1080p and 60fps, good keyboard and mouse support. Very well optimized, I could run this on my tablet if I wanted to"
"Owned and played VC 2 and 3 on the PSP, by the time I got my PS3, VC 1 was no where to be found for me to purchase.   ****3 years and 6 months later (11/11/14)****  I was so excited taht VC 1 was made to be available for PC on Steam. Played a bit and made me had the same feelings as 3 years ago regards to gameplay.  While this is a port not a remaster, it is much better then Assassin's Creed 2 onward and Final Fantasy XIII. The only issue I am having is the controls. Other than that, the game runs great with Intel HD GPUs, getting 40-45fps, 55-60 fps with nVidia 750m.  Pros: ++Graphical options - Resolution and framerate ++Solid  +Memorable series theme  Cons: -Unfriendly keyboard inputs -It would be nice to have anti-aliasing built-in  For short, get the game if you missed it, or you played VC 2, 3 but skipped the first one. My rating [so far]: its a 9/10 underrated game (series) that has been under the radar for too long  **Friendly challenge Play the game before you watch the anime [Yep, an anime series was made 6 years ago (2008), so you can judge whether it was a good adaptation or not! :P"
Unique gameplay and you have your pick of the waifus.
"I bought this game originally on PS3, it was great then and it's great now. I was initially worried that it would require a controller to play but the keyboard and mouse controls are great, though you are locked to WASD in the menus.  This is an awesome port, being able to play one of my favourites at 1080p and 60FPS was worth the cost.  Square Enix, take note; this is how a good port is done."
Brothers in Arms with cute girls doing cute things.
"Oh Valkyria Chronicles, how I've missed you."
"A fun and challenging strategy-RPG. Some questionable design choices in regards to UI and troop movement, but a great overall experience."
"The controls are not very good, especially for the tanks. This comes with all of the DLC that was available for the PS3 game too which is a very nice bonus. The game is natively 720p and changing the setting to 1920x1080 just makes some things blurry or grainy, it does not actually scale anything up.     As for the game itself, I played it on PS3 and bought it here immediately when I saw it. It is an excellent game, if you dont skip through every scene and actually watch them it has a well written storyline and good character development for the main characters. There are some good plot twists and the story does well to convey several of the realities of war without being particularly graphic or making light of serious situations.   There are also tons of little additional bits of information that come along as you play through the game and a lot of nice minute details.   If you like a turn based strategy game this is a good one, you dive into each unit and control it directly in a third person shooter type mode to take the turn. Every unit has a little personality which is driven by their voicing and abilities and weaknesses which change as the characters develop or through mission content. Non essential units can die permanently, so you are encouraged to respect their lives and work to minimize any losses as much as possible. Units level up as a class, not individually, so losing one of your more used units does not cost you everything they have learned or leveled. If a unit goes down you have a chance to rescue them before they die as well, so sometimes the risk can pay off.  I enjoy this game and have played through it several times, if you are looking for a story driven action strategy game, give it a shot."
"Let me just say up front (because it'll sound like I hate this game in a couple paragraphs): I really liked this game, but that's because I'm a huge lover of SRPGs (Fire Emblem, XCOM, etc). If you're not a fan, might wanna read below to know if it's right for you. If you are a fan, still read below to be aware.  I liked the characters, as well as the slight personality for all most of the 'grunts'. It reminded me of Fire Emblem: Awakening, though the grunts are less developed than that. The story was fine; not incredible, but delightful all the same. Im also glad the characters avoided the Squenix Effect, were relatively simple and weren't all belts and zippers. The translations were really well done, and I like the throwback graphics, though for some reason my comp would chug at times (it's been able to run any game so far without a problem). On the heels of that, though, the team who ported this should be given the utmost credit: they did a very good job of bringing thiis to PC without any muss or fuss (though I did have a clipping issue at one point on level 15).  The real issue is the gameplay itself. In Fire Emblem:Awakening or XCOM, you're given indicators of whether or not you'll miss and how far you can advance. This game doesn't do any of that, and just instead gives you an AP bar for running and no indication of your chances of hitting, forcing you to wing it. That'd be perfectly fine if that system wasn't also intersecting with the rating system. To not struggle immensely towards the later part of the game, you need to get 'A' rankings on your missions to get the exp and gold boosts to upgrade your people sufficiently, or else be forced to replay maps over and over again to farm exp. To get an 'A' ranking, you need to speed through each level with a precision and timing your troops just don't have, requiring you to save-scum and killing some of the fun of the missions. Because if you're gonna go for A rankings, which you pretty much have to, the tactics and decision making becomes very rigid and lacking in choice. Since SRPGs are supposed to be all about doing it your way, I have to raise an eyebrow at one that punishes you for doing it your way. TL:DR version: It's a rigid system in what's supposed to be a fluid genre, requiring a lot more luck than skill or tactics.  And the less said about how the tanks handle, the better.  So at the end of the day, I can recommend it for the story and characters, but gameplay will depend on how easily frustrated you get.  That said, I can't wait for them to put out the second one."
"An old JSRPG that was released as an exclusive for PS3 back in 2008 comes to PC. It brings joy, sadness, and ermuhgerd all doze feelz, along with an HD retooling to better suit the machines it is destined for.  The Great: Story is amazing, albeit very heavily weighted towards the end. Graphics could be said to be dated, but IMO doesn't show it thanks to the stylistic choices made - let it be known that sketch art is amazeballs. Strategy is simple for most missions, but getting the hang of the systems and how to exploit them will aid in attaining those coveted 'A' ratings. Music is fitting and quite delightful throughout. Additionally, people say the english VA is campy, but I found them to be pretty spot on. If it bugs you, you can use the original JAV tracks instead. Finally, the game is of a good length; not too long but not too short. I made it through in around 30 hours with minimal grinding (which wasn't necessary, by the way.)  The Not-So-Great: Those PC Controls.... dear lord they are convoluted and nonsensical. Do yourself a favor, plug in your X360 controller for the best experience. Also, play with your framerate locked to 60Hz until the issue with tank physics is patched... otherwise, your tank won't be able to traverse semi-steep terrain which, while not required, is helpful in various missions.  As an addendum: SEGA needs to release the two sequels on PC as well. I don't care that they were PSP titles, I WANT MORE OF THOSE FEELS! It's a quaint, well-realized world built with enough history and detail that I sat up and read all of the lore. I haven't done so since the first Mass Effect. Generally my time is better spent playing other things, but becoming engrossed in the setting was 100% completely worth my extra time."
"One of the PS3's best games makes a graceful transition into the PC.  A gorgeous game filled with great missions, Valkyria Chronicles remains one of the best and most unique TRPGs I've ever played. While randomly generated content often suits tactical games pretty well it's still nice to play a game with battles that feel designed by people and not spit out by algorithms.  Though it may have been originally released in 2008 aside from the low res FMVs the game doesn't feel outdated at all."
Very nice! One of the few decent anime games which exist on Steam and a very competent port at that! Fun gameplay which progressively gets more challenging on the game goes on! Interesting characters that make you reload saves when they die.   10/10 for filling a niche much needed
"Great port, great story, great artstyle, fantastic music and great turn-based gameplay. You can also play with Japanese audio if you like and the game runs a solid 60fps at 4k on my 4 year old system wich is really fantastic. It also includes all the DLC that was available on the ps3 so you are getting a lot for 20€. This is how you bring old games to PC unlike others 'cough' 'FFXIII' 'cough' so thank you SEGA for bringing this masterpiece!"

"Absolutely amazing. I have been waiting to get a PS3 so I could play this game and its sequels (along with a few more PS3 exclusives like Dangan Ronpa).But now that it finally has a PC port, I don't have to wait till then to start enjoying the game one of my favourite anime series is based on. If you want to get an idea of what the story is like, just watch a couple of episodes, or the whole thing (but spoilers are are obviously a concern if you wacth the whole anime.)  The controls aren't hard to get used to, even if you aren't using a console controller or gamepad, it runs really smooth, cut scenes are beautiful and the voice acting is superb (Japanese voices, haven't tried English and likely never will). The whole idea of a RTS/TPS is something I had been wanting since I was a kid, and this game turns a great idea into a masterpiece. It is seriously worth buying, and if you aren't too sure, just watch some gameplay on a random YouTube channel (not a review video) to get a feel for what its like.  As of yet, any drawbacks of the port that most people spoke of, if they did speak of drawbacks, I didn't really notice or mind at all.  Still will be getting a PS3 eventually so I can play the sequels and other JRPG PS3 exclusives."
OMG luv this game a lot... cuz its sooo cute + 3D anime cartoonist style with rpg + tbs theme.... and also the voice acting !! soooo coool !! xD  ps. everything works great so far... with controller and graphic ! xD  ps2. touched ! luvly story line !
"Wonderful game with a wonderful story line. Even if you have the PS3 version of this classic, re-purchasing this game is still worth it. At a higher resolution support and higher frame rate than the PS3 version, the PC version will allow you to relive this game in a more visualy smooth way. If you have played this game yet, you definetly need to put this on your list!"
"This is a Wonderful PC port of a game I've already poured hours into but wanted to do it again, control scheme is wonderful, and in my opinion Valhalla Chronicles has some of the best character development and backstories ever. There are many cutscenes which may become tedious for some players who like to jump into only the action but I prefer to know at least who I'm fighting with and what I'm fighting for. My only dislike is the fact that the AI in the game won't really ever outsmart you, but you could be overrun by troops that are far too out of your league, and that feels to me like a 'bad loss' where a good loss is when you lost because of a failure to be as strategic as possible with your actions and a bad loss is one where you could replay the mission as many times as you wanted and still die, even then, the challenge missions (which I'm probably not supposed to do until a higher level because they clearly outclass me) can be won with decent strategies and some guile. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes a good, fun, story-based game, or who likes strategy games with a slightly easier learning curve to them."
Here's to hoping that we'll see Kurt Irving and The Nameless in action.
"Great game, Great port, My only complaint is the cutscene quality is locked.  Apart from that 9/10"
"The lore is solid, and the story starts off with plenty characterization for the main characters. Top it off with gameplay mechanics worthy of a turn-based strategy and you have a promising game that's probably priced too low for its own good.  As a port, it is incredibly well-optimized and should play well for most systems. Seriously, just get this game and play it in your free time. If you're a fan of turn-based strategy, then this game gives no room for you to dislike it."
Best port of a game I have seen in a long time on PC. This is a great game with a lot of depth.
"Great game... an all time favorite. Few games are this polished, creative, and beautiful... challenging too!"

"I bought a PS3 for this game back in the day (and it is still the only PS3 game I have); unfortunately my work life balance died about a week or so after I bought it, and so I packed up the PS3 never finishing Valkyria Chronicles (or ever unpacking the PS3 again).  Not this time damn it, this time I will beat you Valykyia Chronicles!"
Best Strategy RPG to come out of Japan in at least a decade.
"A very hidden gem of a game based on a very hidden gem of a anime series, I never played the original of this game on PS3 but was always a fan of the show its based on, I preordered this as soon as I saw it hit Steam, and boy am I glad I did!.  If your a fan of turn based games with a amazing story, a game with alot of charm, and you really becoming emotionally attached to each member of your team like a worried parent! buy this game as you wont regret it."
"It's good game, a good port, at good price. I recommend an immedeate purchase."
"i played this on the PS3 and got fairly far, but as a PC gamer at heart, i never got around to beating it.  this is a quite good port, and a very high quality, underrated turn based strategy, 3rd person shooter, RPG.  if you only have 20 bucks to spend and like RPG's, get this game."

"What a great early birthday present. Thank you Sega.   *Don't read any reviews. If you like terrific story telling and strategy rpgs...(Fire Emblem, FF Tactics, etc.) .please buy this game!   Don't let the anime inspired look fool you. Even if your not into anime, trust me you need this one in your collection! =D  10/10."
"Perfectly ported JRPG that features turn-based combat with real-time mechanics, very fun! It's fully compatible with the XBOX 360/Xinput control scheme!  Great voice acting, and tactical WWII style combat, with tanks...I don't know what to say to sum up this game. I've never played it before the PC port, but at 11 hours in, it's quite deep and enjoyable in the content it offers and in the attempt to provide an ambient universe, with characters that move you to feel emotion when they're in danger!   I recommend this game, wholeheartedly. It's a breath of fresh air in the stale RPG market! "
grear game 5/5
"Massive fan of this back when it came out on the PS3, highly recommend picking it up on here as this port is fantastic and the price is right - cheaper than you're likely to find a used copy of the PS3 version, and all around better. Plus it includes all the DLC!  Even if you're not usually a strategy game fan (I'm indifferent to them personally), this is a fantastic little gem that's absolutely worthy of your time. Plus it will help set a precedent for more of this sort of thing getting ported over with this level of care!  PS: Plus bonus point for having cameos from Skies of Arcadia. Vyse and Aika are both deployable characters and Fina makes an unnamed appearance as a medic."
"This game is one of the most recommended games on the PS3 for good reason. It was also the very first thing I bought for my own PS3 a few years ago...  It had its claws in me for a good while, over more than two complete playthroughs — and I'm not usually into strategy/tactical gameplay being in my JRPGs, nor into war-themed settings in general.   Why's it worth your time?  - Gorgeous canvas/cel-shaded art style and an interesting, fantasy WWII-like setting - Likable and memorable characters - A decent, sometimes moving story - Some great music composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto (of 'Final Fantasy Tactics' and 'Final Fantasy XII' fame) - Fun, rewarding, and often times addictive tactical combat that isn't hard to get into but has a lot for veteran tactical players to sink their teeth into, with options for skirmishes outside of just the main campaign - Many, many units to choose from, making your group makeup, weapon loadout, and strategies all very customizable - A great New Game+ option with good reasons to replay the game besides just the basic 'playing again with all your old stuff'  The PC port appears to be pretty damn good as well, supporting both keyboard/mouse and controllers, and having a decent amount of graphical and framerate options to choose from. It also comes bundled with ALL the DLC. Just don't... knock the FPS up too high; the game's physics engine was clearly coded for 30 FPS and has some strange things (like interception damage taken and tank movement) tied directly to the framerate."
"A story-heavy turn-based strategy game.   [ + ] Fun gameplay. Good production value.  [ ? ] Difficulty curve. Some missions may be frustrating.  [ - ] Large download size due to uncompressed files.  [ - ] Cheesy writing and dialogue. Overdramatic voice work (both languages).   If you get frustrated easily or don't have much time, there are other games that provide greater and faster satisfaction."
"What if you took X-Com: Enemy Unknown, turned it into an anime, and set it during World War II? You'd get Valkyria Chronicles. If you enjoy strategy games at all, whether that means X-Com, Civilization, or Starcraft to you, you'd be doing yourself a favor to give Valkryia Chronicles a try.  Now SEGA, bring over Skies of Arcadia next!"
"Strong mechanics, polished story, compelling characters and gorgeously high production value secured this title a place among the best critically received exclusives on PS3. The game combines traditional turn-based strategy with real time third person shooter elements to create its one of a kind combat. It is a must have for fans of strategy games, RPGs or even anime in general.  As a port on PC, some of the woes surrounding the PS3's hardware limitations will no longer be present. Saving/loading will be easier and faster, and the game supports higher framerate and resolution. The performance is also surprisingly amazing. The game runs even on netbooks with integrated graphics cards. Support this title, and perhaps SEGA will bring more of their games to PC, such as Vanquish and Bayonetta."
"Wonderful port.  Plays smoothly at 60 FPS under 1440P resolution, too. Great story and soundtrack. If you enjoyed Final Fantasy Tactics, this is what you should be playing now. Strongly recommend to play with a gamepad."
"Just a quick review, especially since I haven't actually finished the game: Good: -Combat and Mission design (you can generally establish a favored strategy, but there are some curve balls) -Art -Relatively intuitive gameplay -Some legitimately nice story moments -Interesting backstory -The various potentials and backstories do a decent job of helping you to remember your squadmates, and permadeath might actually feel weighty as a result  Meh: -The overall story (a bit saccharine and anime-esque at times, but some people will be used to this) -The subs for the Japanese voices aren't always in tune with what they're actually saying -The way the cover system works seems oddly picky -The fact that enemies can shoot at you while you're moving adds an interesting gameplay dynamic, but can be incredibly frustrating in close quarters combat -This is probably not the case on harder difficulties, but the squad revival mechanic seems overly forgiving -Sometimes the dialog can drag a bit -I thought the music was largely forgettable, but that might just be my personal taste  Bad: -The menu system (it seems really clunky and annoying)  In the end, it's been a very fun game thus far, and the only wholly negative thing I can think of is the horrible, horrible menu system. If you are used to anime (or can stand a very anime-esque story) Valkyria Chronicles will be a fun game."
"Tactics Combat with action elements pacing the encounters, paired with an interesting story telling. For me it's love at first play. The kind of entertainement I expected to get from so many deceiving tactic games.  Can absolutely recommend to any tactics amateur."
Spend 3 turns trying to blow up a tank with just grenade on the last i did kill the tank but the explosion killed me   12/10
"What a great early birthday present. Thank you Sega.   *Don't read any reviews. If you like terrific story telling and strategy rpgs...(Fire Emblem, FF Tactics, etc.) .please buy this game!   Don't let the anime inspired look fool you. Even if your not into anime, trust me you need this one in your collection! =D  10/10."
"Perfectly ported JRPG that features turn-based combat with real-time mechanics, very fun! It's fully compatible with the XBOX 360/Xinput control scheme!  Great voice acting, and tactical WWII style combat, with tanks...I don't know what to say to sum up this game. I've never played it before the PC port, but at 11 hours in, it's quite deep and enjoyable in the content it offers and in the attempt to provide an ambient universe, with characters that move you to feel emotion when they're in danger!   I recommend this game, wholeheartedly. It's a breath of fresh air in the stale RPG market! "
"Amazing game, after so many years from the PS3 version feels awesome. Really nice port except no 16:10 (can solve with program) support, 720/30FPS cutscenes and blurry style of game.(you can use Gedosato for solve this) Game concept amazing and 60FPS suit cool.   Buy this game folks, we need more awesome games like this!"
What can i say..Was gem of a game for ps3 and they just made it even better! A must buy game to add to your steam collection of strategy games.
Tank flipping simulator 2014. Can't figure out how to make my tank not just flip around in circles while just driving with a controller or keyboard. Great game otherwise though. 10/10 if the tanks drove correctly.
"This port of the 2008 PS3-exclusive is the best gaming release of 2014. I can only hope this franchise awakens on PC, so SEGA can finally reach the audience it was meant for."
"Game runs like a dream. Amazing port.   If you've never owned a PS3, get this game. You won't be disappointed."
One of the few games that made the purchase of a PS3 worth it is finally here!  Why are you reading this? Go buy/play this game already!
"Highly recommended for people who enjoy story-intensive jRPGs. Gameplay is pretty challenging, definitely not a rush-in type game."
"This ia an OUTSTANDING game. If you like Skies of Arcadia, Anime, or tactical games even a little don't miss it! The graphics have a very cool 'colored pencil' cell shaded art style. The gameplay is equal parts turn based and real time and the story's vibe reminds me of the 16bit RPGs of old. You command a squad of soldiers and have a certain amount of turns to perform actions with each one. During your turn you control them in 3rd person view and move them around in real time. But when you decide to attack you drop into first person mode to aim and the action pauses allowing you to take your shots. The mechanics are well explained during tutorials in the game.  There are numerous classes and upgrades to each. The missions are creative and enjoyable in their own right but the story may be what is best about this game. It has a wonderful plot and set of characters in your squad. The squad mates have good character interactions and you'll actually care about them and who makes it thru the battle.  Also as a bonus for people who remember Skies of Arcadia..You can get Vyse and Aika in your squad! A highly reccomended game. One of the best PS3 games now for PC!"
"This so far is a great port. It can run at pretty much anything. The game does work better with a controller, the mouse and keyboard work but it's a little clunky. You can get used to it though after a little while. If you owned it on PS3, it's the same but it will look much better. If you have never played it then you def should."
One of my favorite games on ps3. more then happy to buy this on PC and hopfully the sequel will come aswell.
"This is one of my favorite strategy games to come out in recent years. This is a very unique game the only thing I can compare it to is Final Fantasy Tactics and XCOM. If you enjoy those games you will love this one. I love building an awesome squad that synergizes well. The only two down sides are the fact you can only rebind keys before you launch the game and the older cut scenes did not upscale as they were not in engine, sad but understandable for a six year old game. The positive now really good mouse and key board support in regards to control and the actual in game engine looks gorgeous and scales well on most systems, I have amazing performance. Be warned this game does not hold your hand. You may find it easy in the beginning but rest assured I promise you there will be encounters that will challenge you and you will enjoy overcoming them. I high recommend this game and hope you will enjoy it."
"Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best games and sleeper hit on the ps3 many years back. Now Sega was Awesome! enough to port this to PC and its a fairly good port. The cut scenes are ok but doesn't look terrible but the ingame play looks as sharp and better than before on pc.   This is one of the best turn based strategy games I played on PlayStation 3 and Im glad to buy this again on Steam for PC. Has great epic music, just listen to the title screen and you already get hit with an awesome theme. The story is fairly decent and bring up points about war and comradery among friends in a anime style-ish kind of way. Another good reason to get the pc version is the load time is cut waaay shorter than that on ps3. Even better when you had it on SSD drives.    It has a WW2ish type feel and the artistic look of the game is amazing. I would Highly give this game a try if your into Turned-based strategy. Or even if your not, its an awesome game and plays/looks great. If you see this on sale later on, I would buy it cause it's a steal! Its decently long and you wont be disappointed a must play in my book."
"A game dealing with war, racism and concentration camps that still manages to include a cute flying pig named 'Hans'."
"Great game, would recommend to anyone who likes strategy games, or jrpgs."
Some of the most fun I've had gaming in years. I haven't had any problems with this PC port either!
"A great little game excellently ported over to PC. The graphics and animations are top notch, and while the music gets repetitive after a while it is still high quality. I only had one issue with crashing that was fixed by disabling the seam overlay. Highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys turn based tactic games (think xcom)."
"Phew! What a game! Wow! Amazing!  Seriously, this is one of the best gaming experiences I've had in a long time. First off, it's a great port. Customize controls, muck with graphics settings, and easily use a mouse and keyboard if you wish. Well, sometimes driving the tank isn't the easiest with the mouse, but it's a pretty minor concern. Not only is the port well done, but the game itself is fantastic. It's like if Studio Ghibli made a movie about World War Two, and gave you interactive control over all the little battles in which our plucky protagonists participate. Think X-COM with an order pool. I'm only about 5 chapters in, but the difficulty has been a nice gradual slope, and the system is complex enough that you can play around a little. Add in relationships between squadmembers, a nice little R&amp;D and unit training system, and a boatload of solid voice work and you've got a recipie for awesome.  My ONLY real issue is the occasionally uneven pacing. Sometimes the jumps between discussions of minority rights and the horrors of war to lighthearted anime antics and squad-level hijinks can be a bit jarring. Of course, this could be seen as an result of the style and influences.  Anyone who likes anime, military history, or squad-level tactics should give this game a really solid look."
"One of the best strategy RPGs I've played last gen. Glad to see that Sega at least made an effort with this one. A straight up port would have served me fine but the minor added features are most welcome (widescreen support, refresh rate matching, japanese audio, and etc). An excellent port for an excellent game. Here's to hoping they bring over the rest of the series.  I can't recommend this enough. It's a must buy."
"Excellent Game - GREAT that it's on PC. Load times are extremely quick on a good system. Much faster than the PS3. Graphics are identical to PS3, no better resolutions it seems, though there ARE options for it. Just doesn't appear more crisp. Love this game though. Want to see more!!! Bring on the sequel."
"Beautifully crafted and brewed with love.  You go, SEGA! You go!"
Probably one of the most underrated games out there. It is a wonderful masterpiece that feels like an old Final Fantasy game turned into a WWII third person shooter.
"So, first and foremost, this game is a port from the Play Station 3. Ports have not had the greatest history on steam, but rest assured, there are many things in this game that were done right: - Framerate defaults to 30fps, but this can be changed. - The resolution defaults to 720p, but this as well can be changed. - The controls are fully customizable for mouse and keyboard, and the game recognizes and works with the xbox 360 controller, so far as to have the buttons show up on the HUD in game. - Fullscreen can be toggled on or off - Don't forget V-Sync! Yay V-Sync! Most of these things are really what should be expected from a game on steam these days, so knowing that some ports are coming out with this now makes me happy (there are some that are missing these features that shall not be mentioned here, instead I will mention llamas: Llamas). What's even better than ports coming out with these basic features PC gamers have come to expect? When the games that are being ported are games like Valkyria Chronicles, this game is great! No really! You who are taking the time to read this should really consider buying it, if not for the game just to support the porting of games like this to steam. And also, TRADING CARRRRRDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Disclaimer: You may want to read a review that actually talks about the game itself before purchasing."
"Those who have watched the anime probably aren't too keen on getting this game. If you fall under that category, rest assured that the game is much better, the anime's storyline was butchered into a terrible adaptation.  The game potrays Alicia (the main heroine) as a likeable character with clear motivations instead of as generic tsundere in distress.  Gameplay is kind of like XCOM, turn based combat strategy. Graphics aren't as spectacular, but are uniquely appealing in their own right. Storyline of Valkyria is definitely better as well.  A must buy for fans of Japanese games, support more SEGA games getting onto Steam! :P"
One of the all time best games ported from PS3. Pre-ordered it when i saw it. An amazing story and fantastic game. A must buy!
Played and beat this game on the PS3 when it came out 6 years ago and I am ready to beat it again! I am happy Sega ported this game to the PC and hope they continue to do so with other games.
"Great port.  Now bring on Eternal Arcadia, Sega."
"This is an excellent game, one of the best formerly PS3 exclusives of that generation. The PC port is very good, allowing uncapped FPS and 1080p and very smooth from what I have played so far.  The PC graphic options are limited to framrate and resolution but the unique art style still looks great.  This is a mid-length tactical JRPG that can be quite difficult later in the game but never unfair.  It's a must-have if you're a JRPG fan and even if you played it on the PS3, it's still worth picking up on the PC since all of the DLC is included.  "
"Valkyria Chronicles This is really a great adventure game mixed with turn based strategy feeling. The main strenght is the story which involves the politics in a small neutral state right in the middle between the borders of 2 superpowers waging war with each other. The story is also much about the team you're playing with. Happiness, tragedy, life, death, friendship, mistrust, tolerance, prejudice - everything is in that story!  Good things: - The story. - Graphics, beautiful handdrawn art anime. Runs smooth. - The lenght. Alot of content.  Although there are two things which I didn't like about the game related to the turn based combat. The battles can be a challenge the first time you do them and of course you need to upgrade your squad's gear and your tank because your enemy gets harder. But when you have learned the AI and the game mechanic it's really easy to exploit it to make it really easy on normally a hard map. Quite often the AI do dumb decisions when it moves its troops.  Another small thing is the control when using the tank. It's abit clunky and odd until you get used to it.  Steam can put this game up on sale from time to time. Still it's worth it even at full price but it's better to wait for the sale. It's a great game! :)"
"Wonderful and thoughtful JRPG / FPS / Strategy hybrid. Top notch music and great graphics. A story you can really get into, despite the buzzkill anime pig."
"This is my favorite of any game released for the PS3, Wii, or Xbox 360, and it still holds up well. The Miyazaki-styled look is as wonderful as ever and the combination of turn-based strategy and Gears-style action combat is still as fun as ever. I can't give this game enough recommends, especially if you missed it on PS3. For my part, I bought this game on Steam even though I still have my PS3 copy that I bought new when it came out, just because I love VC that much."
"They say simplicity is the greatest form of sophistication. Valkyria Chronicles definitly subscribes to that philosphy. The strategy elements running under-the-hood are accessible for everyone. Well paced and appropriately difficult, the game ratchets up the intencity from 15-minute long, low stakes, introductory missions, to hour long (quick save available) take-no-prisoners escapades. More than just a war game, Valkyria Chronicles has a beautiful blend of the human side of the equation. This is my 2nd time buying the game, and will be my 4th playthrough."
Definitely a genre for avid gamers. You either like it or you don't. It has a wonderful story and innovative gameplay from its time. One of the best ports I have ever played. Highly Recommended.
"Ive played the hell out of this game and beat it like a lot of other people have on the ps3. Ive also played and beat VC2 and am currently in the middle of VC3 and I have to say you will not go wrong with this game or its sequels, in terms of graphics (well the graphics for the second and third game are watered down versions of the first one, but aren't necessarily bad), story, gameplay and even the soundtrack. This is a spectacular port for an amazing game that deserved a lot more attention than it was given. If you ever come across this game do not hesitate to buy it. I guess my only gripe with the PC port is that its aspect ratio is locked at 16:9 and there's no FOV option (at least not until someone succesfully hacks it) so I can't make use of my multi-monitor setup with this, but at least you can scale upto and past 4K on here and play the game in glorious 60fps."
"Seen the anime and really enjoyed that. Game play is really smooth and the graphic style is good in my opinion. Its fun to play and I like the character depth, and action in this game."
"Amazing port of an amazing game, definitely worth the cash."
"Bretty gud strategy game that I love and have played for many hours on PS3. It seems to be an untouched port directly from the console, with the biggest difference I've noticed being the blessedly sped up loading times.  It's turn based--you use up all your command points activating units, then your enemy does the same. You select which units to 'activate' from a two dimensional battle map, but after selecting a unit, the camera changes to a third person camera for the unit you've selected. From there you run around and aim/fire like a third person game until you've used at least one item/attack and exhausted your movement points for that unit, or until you manually end that unit's turn. You can level up your troops, upgrade their armor and guns, and customize your tank, so there are some 'RPG elements.' The troops are also unique characters, each with their own strengths, weaknesses and quirky potentials that provide some variety even among units of the same class.  It scratches my X-COM squad-tactical-strategy itch, complete with permanent unit death, though not as punishing difficulty wise. The cutesy animu style belies a story that is at times quite stark and serious, covering topics like racism, xenophobia and the callous indifference of war. The experience is futher enhanced by a solid and memorable soundtrack, including one of my favorite vocal songs from a video game.  A big thanks to SEGA for making it easy for PC players to enjoy what I believe to be one of the best games on the PS3.   Psssst... SEGA... please bring VC 2 and 3 to PC also and take my money. :^D"
"Absolutely loved this game on the PS3, and the port to PC is pretty good. Nice unique take on a strategy rpg, with a great variety of maps and unique goals. I played many hours of this on the PS3, and now I can see myself doing it all over again on PC. Plenty of replayability as you figure out new ways of tackling each mission."
"This game is beutiful. The watercolor-ish art style is great and makes it kinda feel like you're reading a storybook. This game is filled with moments that make you actually think, since perma-death is in this game (R.I.P Wavy T^T). Anyway, the game play is great, and the story kinda makes sense (Meaning that you can keep up with it). Its requires strategy, skill, smarts, and a little luck (I have no luck, btw. R.I.P Wavy).     This may be good for some people, but at the start of the game you get kiddnaped by a Waifu. Enjoy that, and the fact that shes one of the two characters that wear skirts into combat. gg."
9/10 Great game and good port!!  Bad: Couple of CTDs. No warning or indication just straight to desktop. (damn lack of autosave) 
"THANK YOU SEGA for the announcement of a PC port within weeks of its release, if only others followed through and were so straight forward and on time about their releases. VC's™ :D console roots are apparent from'press start' to it's relatively awkward keyboard nav controls (default, can be changed) the usual fare, but unlike some ports you won't find left over ps3 control schemes here or menus you can't quit out of. There's a Fairly rudimentary pre launch pc settings menu, which isn't a take away from the game its self but rather something welcome for ports, especially for a game released 6 years ago. RTS, RPG, Third person shooter? Inside out , upside down? whats your pleasure?"
"I originally missed out on Valkyria Chronicles in 2008 when it came out on PS3 so I was quite eager to finally play it.  The game is basically a turn-based strategy game but with a real-time move and combat system. I know, that's kind of confusing, but trust me, it's a good thing. You end up getting put in charge of a largish squad of people who each have a unique personality and set of traits, which makes things interesting as each of them can die and be lost forever.  Really, it's a hard game to properly describe, but trust me, as someone who has had many regretable impulse buys, this is actually worth the money."
"Here is my first comment, while the combat and game elements are excellent I would class this as a Visual Novel. I've spent as much, if not more time, simply watching the characters interact than I have playing the combat. If you don't like cutscenes or heavy narrative elements then I would avoid it.  However, the narrative is incredibly well realised and absorbing. It's rich and touches on elements not normally found in games. The parrallels are easy to see, but unlike a more historically accurate setting the alternate earth allows for enough freedom that the story goes in unexpected directions. You can know what happened in WWII, but you can only guess what will happen in the game.  The mix of realtime and turn based combat is excellent, and I'm very disappointed that it didn't become a 'thing' as I'd like to play it in other games (Xcom, I'm looking at you).  Don't expect fast paced action all the time - but the action it has is excellent."
"Every second you spend reading this is a second you could have spent playing Valkyria Chronicles. Keep that in mind.  It's day one of the release of this PC version, so a review might seem premature, but I played the PS3 version extensively and this seems exceedingly faithful to it.   From a technical point of view, the engine seems to have come across flawlessly, and the full range of resolutions available would at least indicate that it hasn't been a lazy port by any means. Surround sound works well, M+K controls are well-implemented alongside the direct controller support, and the entire experience is smooth - as a port, I doubt we could ask for anything better.  The game itself is a predominently turn-based squad tactical game, although that severely undersells the charm and quality of the gaming experience it provides. You're given a pool of 'command points' each turn with which to issue orders to your squad from an overhead tactical map. View then shifts to the unit in question, and you proceed to control them in semi-realtime action, moving them and performing such actions as they are capable of on their turn (such as shooting, throwing grenades, healing, etc). That unit's turn ends when they run out of 'action points' or when you choose to end it early, and view switches back to the overhead map screen where you can use your next Command Point. This continues until your Command Points are used up and the enemy gets a turn. This continues until victory or loss conditions are met. It sounds simple, but like many tactical games there's a lot of depth available to you that you'll only appreciate by playing it.  Bracketing the combats are many well-presented story segments done in the game's signature watercolour style which are a joy to behold, as well as the opportunity to construct, expand, and advance your squad. You also get to delve into the backstory of several of your squad members as they can get their own little sub-missions.  If you've gotten this far, you've probably spent 2 minutes now reading this instead of playing the game. Shame on you! This deserves to be a huge success on the PC, hopefully breaking free of the somewhat cult status it holds on the PS3. Buy it now - Galia needs you!"

"Just a quick review, especially since I haven't actually finished the game: Good: -Combat and Mission design (you can generally establish a favored strategy, but there are some curve balls) -Art -Relatively intuitive gameplay -Some legitimately nice story moments -Interesting backstory -The various potentials and backstories do a decent job of helping you to remember your squadmates, and permadeath might actually feel weighty as a result  Meh: -The overall story (a bit saccharine and anime-esque at times, but some people will be used to this) -The subs for the Japanese voices aren't always in tune with what they're actually saying -The way the cover system works seems oddly picky -The fact that enemies can shoot at you while you're moving adds an interesting gameplay dynamic, but can be incredibly frustrating in close quarters combat -This is probably not the case on harder difficulties, but the squad revival mechanic seems overly forgiving -Sometimes the dialog can drag a bit -I thought the music was largely forgettable, but that might just be my personal taste  Bad: -The menu system (it seems really clunky and annoying)  In the end, it's been a very fun game thus far, and the only wholly negative thing I can think of is the horrible, horrible menu system. If you are used to anime (or can stand a very anime-esque story) Valkyria Chronicles will be a fun game."
"99 outa 10. Game is so great you won't even need a reach around.  The story is great, building on real world history to a minor degree. The Darksen representing the jews. It has some rasicsm. It's not all fun and games but it mostly is. Just about everything you deside to do changes the apperance of your units.  Planning ahead or learning from your mistakes. The game is a great experience in a strange tactical gametype. Try it out. More then likely your money will be well spent."
A great game itself but also now a greater port. This game runs well and looks great due to its insteresting artstyle and mechanics. Controls are a little weird at first but after a couple minutes you get used to it. If you like the anime or like turn based startegy this is probably for you.
One of the best ports I've ever seen. +Great controls (Also includes gamepad support if you do not fancy Mouse + Keyboard) +Adjustable resolution +Optimized  Quite literally my only complaint is with the art style itself; playing at 900p feels like it's being rendered at 720p because of the soft outlines. It's all good though!
"I picked this one up based on Steam's recommendation and am very glad I did. As someone who never had a PS3, I never had the opportunity to play this magnificent game until now. The artwork style is very crisp, the gameplay is engaging and creative, and the storyline, though somewhat cliche, is delightful. Here's hoping that Sega ports the other games in the series to PC!"
"Where do I begin...  I played this game when it first released on PS3, loved every moment about it, I played it more than I slept for months on end. I beat the game about 7 or 8 times during the initial rush. It never got dull to me, between beating the game and watching the Anime with it, it was a perfect combination.  The PC Port of this game, as I've played it thus far is without a doubt, the best PC Port of a game I;ve ever seen in action and had the privallege of playing. The gameplay is top notch, perfect 60fps no dips no nothing. Just perfect and smooth. The cutscenes are fluid as they were on the console.  This game has been apart of my life since 2009, and now, since my ps3 is out of service, can live on with me even longer than it has.I don't wanna go into talking about the story of Valkyria Chronicles, but I will say I highly recommend this game. That may be biased, since it is one of my favorite games, but all in all, its well worth the 20 bucks again."
"Oh Valkyria Chronicles, how I've missed you."
"A fun and challenging strategy-RPG. Some questionable design choices in regards to UI and troop movement, but a great overall experience."
"Excellent Game - GREAT that it's on PC. Load times are extremely quick on a good system. Much faster than the PS3. Graphics are identical to PS3, no better resolutions it seems, though there ARE options for it. Just doesn't appear more crisp. Love this game though. Want to see more!!! Bring on the sequel."
"Beautifully crafted and brewed with love.  You go, SEGA! You go!"
Probably one of the most underrated games out there. It is a wonderful masterpiece that feels like an old Final Fantasy game turned into a WWII third person shooter.

Most of these things are really what should be expected from a game on steam these days, so knowing that some ports are coming out with this now makes me happy (there are some that are missing these features that shall not be mentioned here, instead I will mention llamas: Llamas). What's even better than ports coming out with these basic features PC gamers have come to expect? When the games that are being ported are games like Valkyria Chronicles, this game is great! No really! You who are taking the time to read this should really consider buying it, if not for the game just to support the porting of games like this to steam. And also, TRADING CARRRRRDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Disclaimer: You may want to read a review that actually talks about the game itself before purchasing."
"Those who have watched the anime probably aren't too keen on getting this game. If you fall under that category, rest assured that the game is much better, the anime's storyline was butchered into a terrible adaptation.  The game potrays Alicia (the main heroine) as a likeable character with clear motivations instead of as generic tsundere in distress.  Gameplay is kind of like XCOM, turn based combat strategy. Graphics aren't as spectacular, but are uniquely appealing in their own right. Storyline of Valkyria is definitely better as well.  A must buy for fans of Japanese games, support more SEGA games getting onto Steam! :P"
One of the all time best games ported from PS3. Pre-ordered it when i saw it. An amazing story and fantastic game. A must buy!
Played and beat this game on the PS3 when it came out 6 years ago and I am ready to beat it again! I am happy Sega ported this game to the PC and hope they continue to do so with other games.
"Great port.  Now bring on Eternal Arcadia, Sega."
"This is an excellent game, one of the best formerly PS3 exclusives of that generation. The PC port is very good, allowing uncapped FPS and 1080p and very smooth from what I have played so far.  The PC graphic options are limited to framrate and resolution but the unique art style still looks great.  This is a mid-length tactical JRPG that can be quite difficult later in the game but never unfair.  It's a must-have if you're a JRPG fan and even if you played it on the PS3, it's still worth picking up on the PC since all of the DLC is included.  "
Truely amazing game! This was originally a PS3 exclusive but SEGA has kindly brought it to the PC after 6 years.   Pros -60fps and 1080p resolutions accessible through the configuration menu -excellent keyboard and mouse controls so controller is not required -fantastic soundtrack and story -includes all DLC -Japanese and English audio  Cons -cutscenes are a bit dated but was to be expected -Japanese audio does not match English subtitles which conflicts how characters are represented
"Great port in the sea of horrible ports of Japanese ports to PC. Runs absolutely great, have a few weird character model glitches where some stuff is floating in mid-air. This and the in-combat audio is a little muted but going in and changing the audio options around fixed that real quick.   With this gosh dang good port that can run and look great, along with all the DLC. This game is a must have for someone who enjoys XCOM or other strategy titles as it has got a unique set up unlike any other strategy game I've ever played. That and if you have a need for anime girls with guns this is it."
Valkyria Chronicles for the pc is a labor of love. It was an outstanding game on the PS3 and you can really tell that the developers went the extra mile to ensure it's seamless transition to PC. This game is a must buy for any fan of real time strategy or heavily story based games. I highly recomend Valkyria Chronicles to everyone. This forgotten masterpiece is worth playing at least once.
"This game is really fun!  to be honest i had never heard of it before, so i was kinda expecting COD with anime girls but the way the game handles is actually really amazing.  I'd recomend usng controller to play definitely. it's not impossible to play with keyboard (as i've been doing recently) but controller makes things flow easier, keyboard isn't awful, but definitely will take a bit of memorization/time in the beginning.  every chapter takes me so long to complete but im 200% sure thats just me being amateur, but still fun absolutely because it's kinda fun to be pit in the situations laid out in the game and deploy every action u can think of to make things work- the satisfaction of seeing the finally work towards your favor is great... that's kinda most games tho i guess.  buy it!"
"This game was better than I expected, but probably not really replayable. It's not a strategy game (not even in the Fire Emblem sense of 'strategy) as much as a puzzle game, really. There's basically one approach (Mostly 'use Caution on a scout, rush the flag') that will give you an A-rank in a mission. Trying to do something else will probably backfire (Though I'm sure you can finish every mission without ever using a scout, if you're not into tangible or intangible rewards).   I still see a lot of Fire Emblem resemblances, and I feel like the game would have been far better if the semi-generics you can recruit to your squad had a bit more interaction with each other and the main cast beyond their combat barks (something like FE supports) and if every unit you brought on the field got a turn, while CP would be used for extra turns and orders.   The anime is... a thing. The squad has a flying pig mascot character. After you liberate a concentration camp (and the guards massacre the prisoners in retaliation) there's a beach episode. Magical girls are a nuclear weapons allegory.   ...  I actually liked some of the Not!Jews stuff with the protagonists sister."
"One of the PS3's best games makes a graceful transition into the PC.  A gorgeous game filled with great missions, Valkyria Chronicles remains one of the best and most unique TRPGs I've ever played. While randomly generated content often suits tactical games pretty well it's still nice to play a game with battles that feel designed by people and not spit out by algorithms.  Though it may have been originally released in 2008 aside from the low res FMVs the game doesn't feel outdated at all."
All i've dream of... since a few years!
"I will now decipher the events of the first ten minutes of the game that I played while waiting for Nintendo Treehouse's E3 event to get to the cool part.  In the year 1935, the two main antagonist factions from Star Wars (Empire and Confederation) are fighting over titanite because they want to upgrade their Zweihanders, but Jakob, Cimb, and JD farmed all of it. As a result, they had a big war. My backyard, which was neutral ground, was discovered to have a lot of titanite slabs under it, so they came to dominate me. Before that, Robin (from Fire Emblem) sketches some fish but then gets arrested by some Bruh(l) guards, one of which is Severa (also from Fire Emblem), unless you're Gert, than it's just Asuka. Robin gets sent to jail for being voiced by David Vincent.  It's pretty cool."
"Nice TBS game. It's not as great as XCOM or Final Fantasy Tactics, but the battles are long, diverse and there's room for several different strategies, even though there are only 5 classes of infantrymen and 2 tanks.   The story, inspired by World War 2, but set in a fantastic world, is very good, although predictable and with some childish moments. You'll spend a long time going through dialogue and cutscenes.   I played the main campaign once, on Normal (the highest difficulty for New Game), the “Behind Her Blue Flame” DLC (it was great playing as Selvaria, although obviously it was even easier than the main story) and most of the skirmishes (unfortunately, no new maps are introduced in the extras). I spent about 90 hours with this game and could've spent many more if I were after the 9 out of 20 achievements that I didn't get.  P. S. I love you, Rosie."
"  It's a nice game that I enjoyed enough to want to complete but I don't think I'd ever even want to go back.   First thing, the keys are a bit odd to get used to and even though rebindable, they still feel a bit weird to get used to because some actions are bound to the same key.  The game sells itself as a tactical turn-based strategy RPG where after fights you earn money to upgrade your equipment (or purchase side-chapters) and EXP to improve your squad (or acquire new Orders). You can't replay the main story Operations to try and acquire a higher rank for them until you move on to its New Game +. Not too long into this it starts to feel more like a game of memory &amp; luck instead of strategy because throughout most of the game a good chunk of the enemy operatives stationed are only revealed &amp; visible if you let them have a turn and it just so happens one of your guys sees them or if you have a unit run somewhere and they happen to stumble upon them showing where they are.  There's a system in this game called Command Points that determine how many times you can control a unit(s). You'll see these during your turn on the overhead map view. They regenerate by a set amount every turn and can be saved up by skipping the current turn. CP can also used for giving Orders (buffs) and you can use one CP to move a soldier (two for tanks) and decide where to move them and possibly do an action at the same time such as healing, shooting, and a few other various things depending on the class of the unit you chose. Controlling a tank in this game is bugged when using the mouse. When looking around with the tank, for some reason, you waste AP. Normally you spend a very minimal amount of AP by turning but for some reason the game thinkgs you're trying to turn when you're just looking around. A single unit moves in real-time using Action Points which determine how much distance they can cover before the AP are depleted. I don't believe the real-time part works here because way too often there will be invisible walls and little gaps that look deceptive enough for me to think I can walk through, for example a tree close to a wall with what looks like there's space to fit someone through. However before it's too late I stumble upon an invisible wall because apparently either the tree or that wall has a bigger blockage range than it made it out to be and so the AP I wasted trying to go between that small gap is wasted and you can't exactly have do-overs because the whole thing is in real-time. You can save the game and load while you're in the overhead view in case you don't feel comfortable with the turn you've made but doing so becomes real bothersome.  To get a higher ranking in an Operation, the highest being  A , you have to finish each while making the lowest amount of 'turns' possible. With the way it works though it feels more like I'm trying to exploit the system by rushing as opposed to playing a turn-based strategy game using actual strategy to complete the Operation. An example of this is one of the very last missions where a boss is an overly defended tank where I have to keep shooting it until its armor HP is down to 0. I skipped my very first turn to save up CP and let the enemy with its incredibly unstellar AI do its thing without bringing any of my people down to 0 HP. So my turn comes and all I did was move one of my tanks as close to the boss tank as my AP can handle while after exhausting my AP I take aim &amp; shoot the tank, slowly decreasing its armor HP each shot. Because I saved up all that CP in the skipped turn I can keep moving and shooting until its armor HP is down and reveal the boss tank's weak spot. With enough CP I managed to get behind the tank and shoot its weak spot with two attacks thus ending that boss fight within two turns giving me an A rank. It didn't feel like a strategy more than it did a rushed play. You can also almost complete an Operation with one person because most of the main objectives are basically just capturing a specific flag. If you have enough CP and the right Orders and you place those Orders on that single unit you can pretty much make them a possibly bullet spongy killing machine that can just run towards the main objective.  The enemy AI are almost abysmal. During a boss fight, way too often they'll waste their own CP making unnecessary and sometimes completely pointless orders such as the boss making the order for a Heal Request when everyone of their units are at full health. The enemy AI will also often waste CP to control a unit of theirs to barely do anything or something worse that doesn't put the enemy AI in good light. They'll also often waste their own AP literally running in circles and running to extremely dangerous spots &amp; getting instantly killed. It's almost as if you'd have to actually put yourself in front of them for the enemy to act proper.  The English voice-acting is tolerable at best though you can set it to Japanese. The game's story heavy but it's not too bad. Because it's story heavy however it often felt more like I was going through a visual novel and 3D anime episodes more than I was playing a game.  I suppose if you play 'normally' it's not bad but so many of these what seem to be exploits feel like they ruin some of the fun."
"I loved this game to death, and I felt like giving it a small review after seeing it in my library again, so this is by no means an instant like or dislike.  Roughly, I'd say if you enjoy turn based tactics game to any extent you're likely to enjoy this given you look a bit at the preview images and video. It's very much an open book from the screen shots alone. Action-points-esque movement will always have a soft spot in my book as well as intercept fire, even if it can be annoying some of the time. The various classes offer a wide range of deployment choices for most situations though belgian waffle girl tactics are as cheesy as they are great (I personally preferred lancing all the things with a certain armor support).   The story is very 'war is bad' and 'anime' for what it is, but it's executed well enough and written with care regardless. The team took great care in making sure each of the characters had personality of some sort, if not a bit stereotyped at points for the sake of the story. While I'd write it off if it were any other game, I'm a sucker for the type of war drama offered up by it. I personally enjoyed the perspective offered through the main protaginist and his allies journey. Go into it with an open mind and you'll likely be pleased.    "
"-Played the demo on PSN before it's release, liked it.  -Played the game when it was released on PS3 in 2008, loved it.  -Played the game again on PC in 2015, still love it.  Remains one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played.  Surprisingly great port by SEGA, no issues at all."
I really love the story behind it its emotional lovely cute and its about WAR! isnt that interesting? with a unique gameplay with a drawing style on the scenes and thats totally new for me. i recommend this 110% Love it
"Let not its anime style deceive you - Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing strategy game with a deep plot which will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire experience. If this is the first time you've heard of Valkyria Chronicles, do not hesitate to purchase it, for you will be rewarded with a one-of-a-kind gem that will enchant you with its beauty, gameplay and story."
"I read the RPS review of this game which sung it's praises which got me interested and then I saw the game was only £15 so figured it was worth a punt.  I'm about 10 hours in now and really enjoying it - the little story episodes are pretty good (once I'd got past the cheesy anime stuff - I'm not much of an anime fan) and the characters are built up as the story progresses and they're all fairly interesting and well written.  The mechanics of the game are great - a turn based strategy like XCOM but with real-time elements which makes it far more interesting and adds to the action. Accidentally running out in front of enemy units and getting mowed down is punishing you for not checking if it was clear first. The classes all have their interesting traits but I found that generally the scout/shocktrooper were generally the most useful.  There are a couple of annoying things about the game though - it's stable and looks great on PC but very little thought went into using a keyboard/mouse - I ended up using the keyboard a lot for operating menus which seemed fairly dumb. Also, controlling the tank can be incredibly frustrating at times resulting in wasted AP/CP...I'm not sure if it's a keyboard/mouse conflict but you can end up using up all your AP turning in the wrong direction.  Overally, I was very impressed with it and look forward to finishing it!"
"The Imperial force got huge variety of tanks, a Valkyrur witch and several Metal Gears ! And yet Welkin insisting not to use the Valkyria power when he got the chance at the right time.  He really deserves a smack straight to the face !!  Anyway,, I liked the game ,, it remind me of Fire Emblem awakening at some point. It is a shame that apparently we will not get Valkyria Chronicles 2 &amp; 3 here because they are PSP titles :("
"Very good story , fine gameplay worth buying for sure ."
Save the windmills in freedom burger land from the eastern autocratic stalinists satan worshippers in a highly entertaining mix of strategy and third person cover shooter. Better gameplay than Uncharted - BOOM
"Valkyria Chronicles is basicly a traditional war drama, set in a world that resembles Europe during World War II. It's your classic 'evil empire of evilness wants to conquer your country, longing for more power'-story for the most part, where you as a player follow the military resintance group who fights against the seemingly overpowered foe. It is, however, a JRPG after all. So, don't expect a retelling of historical facts or anything as it is still set in a fantasy world and also - while staying down to earth for the most part - adds a couple of supernatural elements later on.  The story doesn't quite manage to stay clear of cheesy plot twists, especially towards the final chapter where it kind of disregards its own logic and artificially creates dramatic scenes just for the sake of being emotional. That aside though, the main plot is easy to follow and has a good, conclusive ending. As one would expect, it touches on topics like friendship and camaraderie as well as your token love story, but also anti-Semitism, betrayal, anxiety and of course death.  What really makes the otherwise generic story shine, however, is the amount of detail they put into the characters. Not only the main cast, but every single character you use in battles has a unique back story and a reason why they joined the military to fight the 'evil empire' in the first place, ranging from a 27 years old songstress who witnessed the inhuman 'hunts' against the Darcsen race first hand, to a 37 years old widow who lost her eatery, or a 27 years old florist who discovered a strange joy in killing the Imperials after her shop was destroyed by them, or even a 15 years old boy who just wants to protect his brother, and many many more. None of the characters, main and supporting cast alike, follow your typical anime tropes. So, fortunately, there is no annoying tsundere girl, no airhead tomboy, and - first and foremost - no cheesy 'this is MY story' hero.  My favorite part of the game is, however, how the game doesn't just throw backstory about the characters at you to give you something to read, no, the individual character traits also play a major role in how you assemble your squad, because some characters just straight up hate each other lowering their stats when they fight side by side, or some of them have pollen allergies for example inflicting a negative status effect whenever they walk through tall grass, others have superior vision during night time, and some even get a damage boost out of pure joy of inflicting pain to the enemy.  The gameplay in itself is pretty much standard turn based strategy. You choose your favorite units for each mission, select them individiually on a top down battle map which comsumes one action icon, and then change into a 3rd person view to directly move them across the battle field. It allows free movement for as long as the unit has AP, which continuously deplete with every step. (I played with a controller to more precisely maneuver my units around contact mines and over obstacles.) You can then choose to take one action with the character like shooting an enemy, throwing a grenade, healing allies, repairing vehicles ect. Interestingly, the character's turn does not end until you specifically select the 'end current action' command (so, move-&gt;shoot-&gt;move is possible and very much encouraged as clever positioning is pretty important). The game generally feels well balanced in terms of difficulty, although the AI sometimes gives the impression of not using their turns with all their units to their full potential.  As in, you - the player - made a mistake and put your units in a suboptimal position . In theory, the enemy units could now kill your commander/ main character with one attack from behind, which is an instant game over. However, they all just waste their turns on attacks from the front or just straight up run into your (automatic) reaction fire and get killed. This is balanced out by the fact that the AI usually has more soldiers at their disposal and can call unlimited back-up units (this still costs an action per unit called).  There is a good variaty of mission objectives ranging from capturing the enemy base, to killing a specific enemy general or destroying a structure, or holding a camp for as long as necessary, to just moving one of your characters through a group of enemies to a specific point on the map. Several optional missions with extra rewards become available as you progress through the story. The faster you beat a main or optional mission the better your rewards, which can be used to enhance your characters' abilties and equipment.   Tl;dr To conclude this review : if you're looking for a game with a beautiful art design, a nice, classic war story with not-so-tropey anime characters, and you're enjoying turn based strategy games like XCOM, by all means, buy this game."
"Amazing story, great art style, and solid gameplay."
The writing is amazing and the gameplay difficult but totally worth it!
"only game that got me off 5 stacking in dota 2 10/10 would wait 4 years for another port.  but honestly if u like turned based strategy, third person shooting, TANKS and raging at video games cause you get some strange enjoyment out of it like i do its the perfect game for you.   pros: story combat mechanics art style    cons:  also UI has lack of mouse controls which are frustrating at first but its still worth it. sometimes ai acts really dumb. WHERE THE ♥♥♥♥ ARE MY SEQUEL PORTS"
"I recently bought the game a few days ago at 25% off for the christmas sale and i have to say it has been my best buy all year. Already i have logged a great amount of hours playing.  First I want to mention that this is a console port so if you are like me playing on a laptop and you get slowdowns just change the resolution down a bit, for me 1280x720 fixed it. Others say that changing the fps limit to 30 will fix it aswell.  Yes it's a long review i really like this game and wanted to give out my opinion on alot of the topics.  Story:  [+] I am 3/4's way through the game and i have to say the story has been fantastic there has been a great deal of character development from both the main protagonist and the antagonist. It is your classic world war plot with a sub-romance but it pulls it off in a very unique way and every chapter introduces a great deal of information about everything mentioned in the game. For those of you like me that don't mind looking in the glossary or info tabs for more information about all the events, characters, places, and weapons. It does a great job of adding plenty of backstory. *This version of the game includes all the DLC bounus missions and content. *playing battles with extra characters unlocks backstory about them - giving you information on why they have the traits they do. *Story answers questions after it presents them or soon after  [-]  *It is a bit unfortunate that it seems a bit rushed at times (there are a few moments where something happened and some of the characters just gloss over it very fast.),  *the chapters can be extremely short especially with most of the beginning chapters just including 1 battle with a few short cutscenes.  *You may not get some references the characters make in the dialouge if you do not check the glossary on the events that happened in the past. *Some of the characters can be forgettable  Gameplay:  The gameplay is a very unique style which i have to say i love. If you have played X-Com you will notice some similarities. It is a turn-based top down 3rd person tactical shooter 'whew'. You start off in the top down command screen where you use your 'CP' given to you each turn to move your units on the battle field. Once you select a unit you go into third person where you are able to move around as much as their stamina bar will let you then you can do an action ie: shoot, heal ect... The game also allows you to choose what upgrades you want for your tank/weapons If you want a accurate sniper you can make it, then you can make a more powerful one and then equip them to different people in your squad for certain fights.  [+]  *The game is very challenging. There is no difficulty setting for the story missions (atleast for the first playthrough it does not seem to give you a choice.)  *the skirmish battles allow for multiple difficulty choices.  *Every mission will be throwing you into a different scenario forcing you to adjust your strategies on the fly and make quick decisions to complete the given objective.  *some maps may seem small but the use of cover and some nicely placed invisible walls make the maps seem 10X bigger than they actually are.  *The game allows you to have 20 uniquely voice acted characters in your squad. at anytime you can swap them out for different characters who become unlocked as the game progresses. In the battles that i am at i have only been allowed a max of 10 soldiers on the field at a time. [i will update if this changes] *Unique playable characters, with their own personalities and voice acting. *The ability to lose characters forever. (yes your characters can die in battle leaving you to actually care more for the extra guys and gals than you normally would) *ability to save in battles (thank you! lol) *give squad members different weapons so they all don't just have the best accuracy gun should you choose to upgrade it. *Class leveling system - You level by classes not by individual so you don't have to worry about not taking alicia in every battle and think she will fall behind.  [-]  *Some of the gunfights can come down to luck or the old RNG, you can be right behind someone and aim for his head but miss Completely only to leave you facepalming and your character getting downed the next turn lol. *No present diffculty option for the story missions. *some smaller map design limits the posibilities of how to tackle a certain situation. *Tank's seem to dominate really easily so they overload the enemy with tank busters  Graphics/bugs: As it is a Ps3 port i was expecting it to not be in a high quality but i was pleasantly suprised. they have updated the PC version to allow support for beyond 1080p but for me and some others higher resolutions seem to cause problems without limited the frames to 60.  [+] *I love the art style in the game, it is very vibrant and colorful *Runs great with no performance issues whatsoever *All enviroments are very detailed and definetly give off the worn battlefield feel *Characters are visually detailed and animated facial expressions and unqiue movements and animations on the field.  [-] *a strange border style to give it more of a picturesque feel. *30 fps on certain resolutions may be noticable to some. *game will crash often if you alt tab during a skirmish   Language?/Voice: This release is in english but it also comes with a japanese voice option. Unfortunatly it seems that the subtitles in the japanese version use the same ones as if you left subtitles on in the English dub. Now for us who can understand a bit of the Japanese language it seems that what they are saying and what the words at the bottom display do not always match. So if you are an wanting to hear the original script or a direct translation you may be better off finding a fan made translation/patch. I am playing the game with the english voices and i have to point out that they did a fantastic job setting the tone for each character. I even enjoy the lines given to the characters you can recruit into your squad, you can tell what kind of person they are just by how they sound.  Sound/OST: From what i have heard in the game the music is great! the compostition Hitoshi Sakimoto put together fits the mood for almost every scene. he said that it took him a total of eight months to complete it and what time well spent. i can only say that the ost is definitely one i will be looking to pick up in the future. Now for the sounds.  [+]  *The game adds visuals to sounds... what i mean is that if you see a tank moving the game will add a 'Vvrrrmm' or 'rumble rumble' next to it in a anime'ish style which adds alot to the art style. the same can be said for any other sounds like an explosion might have a big 'BLAM!' come out of the ground which is nothing less than satisfying.  *I'm not a gun expert in anyway but they sound good enough to me im not going to complain if they sound fake or hold it against them the sounds they use fit the art style and serious tone, it adds a certain charm to the game.  [-] *Some of the voice acting for the English dub is out of synch with the characters facial animations. This can be normal with translated game but in this one it can be very noticable.  Replayability: As this is a linear game i am a bit worried about how i would enjoy this game on the second time around so far the majority of the 'side quest if you can call it that' is just a skirmish battles, it is very 'this is what you have to do now do it'.  The extra characters that you choose for your squad at start are random. my friend had bought the game and i told him he should get a person named Lynn but he did not have her or many of the ones i started with. he had some characters that i had just unlocked in recent missions.  I may update with more once i start my second playthrough or complete the game.  Overall rating: 9/10"
"This is a fantastic game, I played it for hundreds of hours on the PS3. I'm very glad to see it her on Steam finally"
"After witnessed The Walking Dead's ending, i though i would never cry again with a death scene. I was wrong. Boy, i was SO wrong.       Also you go to war with waifu. 10/10"
"This game has been on my favorite's list practically since I bought it. Yes, it is alternate WWII setting, but instead of a bloody dance between super-powers, it is a small country, caught between an aggressive and yes, genocidal opponent and large, super-power type allies that don't really seem to think that this one small country is all that worth committing to. Don't get me wrong - the battles are fantastic, and the tactics of what type of soldier to use where, when, and the micro-tactics of which individual's strengths best fit a role are fascinating, and that's the point - this game is far more about the actual people doing the fighting.    Why are they fighting?   Who are they?   Do they also hate the race that is persecuted, but don't you be taking over my homeland...   Are they horrified by this hatred, and are they helping not only to protect their homes but, like the people under Nazi Germany who sheltered Jews, are they doing it so that they can feel like human beings?   Are they just patriots in neither camp?   Do they come to realize that their hatred had been unfounded, and come to love an individual of that persecuted race?   Are they a member of that race, and are they fighting for not just their homes but for the lives of their families and their people?   Why are they hated to begin with?   - One of my favorite things about this game is the fact that there are no white or black hats - you have to command soldiers who may be a pain to work with, or are terrified, or are so gung-ho that they are practically nauseating. There are officers on both sides that I want to strangle, and others that I feel great sympathy and respect for.  I nominated this game for the 'Villain Most in Need of a Hug' award because of one of those invading commanders (two actually, but one in particular) because they is used as a tool, and thrown away when that is most convenient... Yet they are a person, and chooses to make their final sacrifice all the more meaningful.  And if the touchy-feely-emotional-connection aspect that I'm describing doesn't attract you, hey, you get to deal with tanks and fighters, train them, earn money to improve them and their gear, and play through some truly fantastic tactical puzzles. This is a great game, and may be the finest war-game you ever play - that's for you to decide.  p.s. get the DLC's - they are worth it."
"Valkyria Chronicles - fully turn-based tactical strategy.

Pros: -Visuals -Sounds and scores (sometimes reminds Batman from 1989) -Controls (full gamepad support) -Tactical approach -Unique usage of every class in batte -Replayability   Cons: -Now Steam thinks I like anime, baka  Do not hesitate to buy, when you sick of XCOM."
"This game is a true gem, I completed it on PS3 and I did not hesitate to double dip when I saw this coming to Steam  The game: The gameplay is somewhat similar to XCOM. It is a turn based tactics, in which you have a base where you improve/recruit your troops, and then you send them to missions. In those missions, you have a number of actions available during your turn that you can spend at will, but the enemies will fire on you while you move your soldier during your turn so it feels a bit more active than other turn based games.  The story: It is about a 'reimagined' World War 2, with several similarities to the real war, and some elements of magic. The campaign is quite lenghty and the story carries you nicely through it with its variety of situations, and diversity of characters.  Graphics: Don't expect anything groundbreaking in terms of graphical fidelity, but the art style used more than compensates for its age, they managed to make the game look hand painted, this is one of those games that will stand the test of time due to its unique visual style.  Port quality: Graphic options include: Vsync, Multiple resolution options and framerate cap Fully rebindable keys, with proper on screen prompts. Good in game mouse and keyboard support, though menus don't support mouse navigation. Movies are 720p I've been playing at 1080p 60fps with no slowdowns, smooth as silk.  All in all, the port is pretty good for a game that was never intended to come to PC.  SEGA has done its homework. I was expecting a lazy port like many others are doing lately *Cough* Dark Souls *Cough* Final Fantasy *Cough* But instead and while it could still be better, I have no real complains about it. So I hope it sells well and they port the sequels too. "

Played it on PS3 before and enjoyed it alot. To get the chance again to play it again is awesome!
"After a few years of initally playing it, I was very intrigued to see one of my all time favorite SRPGs to be Re-Released to a Larger Audience on PC. The best part about this is: The Port is actually great for one, and it does come with all DLC released on the PS3 Version for Free, so that is a major plus, because the DLC is also rather awesome. PC Controls are nice, but I mostly prefer to use a controller because I'm so much more used to it for this game. Music is still as awesome as ever. Graphics have aged a bit, but they're still somewhat beautiful. Story is one of the best I've ever seen in an RPG - No - Any Game ever IMHO, which is why I do praise it so highly. Honestly, if you enjoy SRPGs, what are you doing here reading my review? Go buy this game ASAP, it is a finely crafted masterpiece."
"Valkyria Chronicles is more about Gallia than the Valkyria, but tell that to Sega's marketing department."
"It's good to see that this great game finally got a port to PC, and that the franchise in general has gotten some long overdue attention.  The game is well-paced, and has beautiful artwork and graphics for its time (still looks really good roughly 6 years on). It's an exciting game that has the right balance of difficulty of gameplay and focus on storytelling that is too rarely seen. If you're really interested in the story, but aren't a fan of the gameplay (to each their own, right?), then there's a pretty damn good anime adaptation of it made by A-1 Pictures.  It's definitely a game that went largely under the radar, through no fault of its own.  I really hope this port will sell well enough to incentivise the creation of a new game in the series – or at least ports of VC 2 and 3."
"Great port. Except for the 720p pre-rendered cinematics and the fact that the 'lips' are synched to english voice, which is ridiculous.  But glorious 4k, 60+FPS and all that goes along with it. Thanks for betatesting, console-friends.  The game in itself is still really really great. You know it."
"What can I say... this is a must have game!!! I've played the game on PS3 and now its on PC. Beleive me, this a real good game, strategics are logical, artwork is incredilble (If you open your mind and appreciate graphics besides moderns engines). Also, it's 120 FPS, isn't that all about PC master race?! Buy the game, or wait for it to be on sale, you won't regret it. A must have game for your your library."
"+Great port. Runs well with no issues. +Other than the two main characters, the rest are great. Even the variety of squadmates you can pick all have good personalities and voices. Most of the characters that follow you through the game have a solid amount of character development and grow throughout the story in interesting ways. +The combat system is great. The classes really all feel balanced enough to feel essential in some way, but there's still a lot of room to try different compositions. Units are good in different situations against other units in more ways than some arbitrary Rock-Paper-Scissors approach, and by the end of the game you'll know exactly what to do against a composition of enemies. +Mission design is pretty varied. Pretty much every mission has some unique twist that makes you play a little different, and regularly introduces new mechanics and unique arenas to fight in. +Main story alone took me about 30 hours, plenty of content. There are also a number of side skirmishes and little DLC encounters included that I didn't take the time to go through.  +/- The style isn't for everyone. I'll give them credit in that only ~25% of any given tool or item is based on something straight out of medieval times (I mean hey, only a handful of main characters become invincible upon picking up a sword or something), as opposed to the ~70% or so of any given anime, but the game does a decent enough job of being surprisingly grounded in a number of ways that when the anime bullsh*t rears its head (why does the militia's standard uniform for girls involve thigh-highs and a skirt?) , it can be a little jarring.  -While the combat system is overall great, some missions are pretty rough. Due to the nature of how a lot can happen in a single turn, it's very easy for a mission to go from great to failed in a moment. The only way you really stand a chance to get much done in most missions is either by completely wiping out any enemy forces before working on objectives (causing their unused action points to carry over to future turns as they're inactive), or hope that their AI bugs out and wastes their turn (like parking a Tank on top of a group of enemies and watching them start their turn, walk a single step before getting shot by your tank, and then immediately ending their turn). It certainly keeps things tense, but missions also often introduce new objectives and enemy spawns part-way through, which can really screw you up. If you don't save frequently, you're just asking to have to sit through the intro cutscene and dialogue for a mission again, missions that often take more than half an hour to finish in a successful run.  -While the rest of the cast is great, the two main characters are just dull and ininteresting. Male (I actually can't remember his name) is some generic, overconfident, naive young adult who wins every battle he steps into and is constantly complimented on his weird, constantly comparisons of things with nature. Female exists solely to get offended by his weird compliments and serve as a shoehorned romance from the first cutscene. Her main hobbies include being so good at cooking that a princess breaks her sacred traditions to eat her bread for breakfast the moment she tries it. Her character does serve a role later on in the plot, but it's really more of her being transformed into a plot device that really has no bearing on her character. -Every time that ♥♥♥♥ing pig shows up, I get unjustifiably mad. Seriously, somebody needs to smack its VO in the head and tell him that onomatopoeic words for animal noises are approximations not to be taken literally, and that you sound like a kindergartener when you treat them otherwise. ♥♥♥♥ the pig. -I could seriously go on a rant about the ridiculous moments and plot devices in this story, but I understand it's just Japan being Japan for most of it.  Overall, I liked the game. It has its issues, but it was generally really well polished, with breadth and depth in equal bounds. The style might not be for everyone, but it's generally easy to get past, and there's a lot of fun to be had for a good price. Definitely pick it up and give it a shot, considering its price."

"Amazing world, great story, innovative gameplay and mechanics"
Where the hell is the state alchemist when you need him?!?!  THE GOOD Great anime visuals Fun tactical combat Interesting setting that frankly should be visited more often  THE BAD  Dubbed voice acting has its highs and lows. This is more of a meh No multiplayer (for people who actually give a ♥♥♥♥ about that)  THE UGLY Childbirth in a tank
Felt like a virgin playing this  10/10
"Pros: - Controls are smooth. - Story is superb. - Enemies AI difficulty gets harder towards the end of the game. -   AlicaXWelkin   - Graphics are good. Kinda like that comical-vintage style.  Cons: -   Selvaria's Ruhm   -    General Damon    - The price may be a bit steep. Wait for sales if you want to buy it.  Conslusion: A really good game. Note, this isn't a game about military. It's more about moral values which is friendship, love and loyalty. If military is your is your forte, then you migh dislike this game. Overall, the story is superb. 9/10."
"Storyline hinders from a basis WWII in Europe. One small country is faced against two huge super power countries/nations, similar to during WWII when smaller nations faced against both the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.   The story/plotline shows political issues of all sides, some short rom-com, brief comedy jokes, and tactical viewpoints.   And of course... LOTS and LOTS of Anime cliches.   What's not to love about that?  The game processes through a seemingly 3D like Anime in a watercolour style picture. Which brings the look of the game to an oustanding view, and a work of art.   The character designs are very well made, especially the side characters in which the game also adds short brief autobiographies of them. (Unlocked by progressing through the game)  Little side missions and episodes are also featured throughout the game, just like fillers or OVA series from Animes to keep you still watching and following the series. (They are lovely and great!)  The in-game music/soundtrack is very beuatifully well done. Every corner you turn there will be music that'll either bring you enjoyment, or enjoyment in tears! The soundtrack is great!  I've never had the chance to play this game when it first came out on the PS3 all those years ago.  However now is different! I've just recently finished the game and the story and ending brought me to tears.  Other recomendations from me would be the Anime and the Manga of this series. (They all have short/small plot twists that differ slightly from each other but is still worth spending time to watch/read)  Valkyria Chronicles has everything you could ask for. Storyline/plot, Anime-like episodes, side series/episodes, in-game music (&lt;3), a dash of comedy and romance too!  Every minute I've spent in the game so far is unregretable.   I hope they decide to port the other pieces of this series to Steam!  5/5  10/10 Definetly worth that $19.99 or at any price! 100%! Loved it!"
"I haven't been this engaged in a game in ages. It's pretty, it's interesting, and it's challenging. I skipped it while it was on PS3, and now that it's on Steam (for only $20!) I have no excuse.  Buy this game."
"Great game from start to finish. Story was excellent. Romance a central part of the story, with proper characterization, rather than simply 'I love you because reasons', and therefore is not cringeworthy and actually added a lot.   Gameplay is very fun but unfortunately gets repetitive towards the end as the battles increase in length and has some series balance issues (using scouts is equivalent to using a tactical nuclear strike). It never stopped being entertaining, though."
Really good port of Fantastic game (see sega you can do other stuff the just SANIC!) the pc ver is good optimuse for the pc and no bs like some other japenese pc game ports (killer is dead for example).  The game is really is worth you time and money since you get preaty long game plus all the dlc is all ready in this version of the game also there is a dual audio option for voice acting (eng/jap) that isnt dlc.
JRPG ? Check  Run Smoothly ? Check  Anime-like artstyle ? Check  Great Soundtracks ? Check  Controller Support ? Check  Good Storyline ? Check   Dual Audio ? Check  Overall a good port ? FRICKIN YES 10/10 !!!
Literally one of the best

"I usually don't like to review so soon in a game but I'll say this, if you liked Silent Storm or the combat phases of the first two fallouts you're bound to like the gameplay here. Where the storyline is concerned its been good up to now but lets be fair, less than 3 hours and chapter 3 is not enough to judge a game that looks like its hugely based around the story its telling."
"Highly polished port of the PS3 classic ive been waiting for.  Tactical like Xcom and RPG like FFT, this game shines with quality. Just like in Final Fantasy tactics or fire emblem, you play a tactical RPG with story that has lasting quality."
I came to have fun and left with feels.
"If XCOM and Fire Emblem ever had a baby, it would be this beautiful, beautiful game."

"There are over 400 positive reviews within 24 hours of this game releasing, and only a few negative. More positives will be coming in, surely. If you're wondering if you will regret buying this game, let that be your indicator.   I wanted to discuss something else. Nostalgia. If you're like me, and you used to play games that left an impression on you. Games like Lunar, Lufia 2, Grandia, and for me, even Final Fantasy Tactics. (The Tactics comparision had to be made, as Sakimoto, the composer is the same guy.) I feel there are too many games where you are the over powered hero. The ultimate swordsman (Except, you know, your rival) or you are the silent protagonist doing anything you want without a care in the world, such as in Fallout 3. Now, these games are great. They have a place. Valkyria Chronicles does not place you with a group of super heroes. It places you in a terrible position. A war ravaged fictional country, much like in World War 2.   It does not glorify the war. In fact, quite the contrary. The main character, Wilkin, is fascinated by nature. He loves to draw in his notebook the different things he finds. He loves to create, rather than destroy.   Now to my point. With the combination of being a character who only does what he has to do and take charge, it's like any one of us. You could be put in a situation one day where you either have to take charge and stand up for what is right, or just let others push you down. He isn't a bad-♥♥♥ soldier. Far from it. His group, in a way, represents everybody. How politics drag the average people into the most horrible of situations and they either toughen up or die.   And in the end, it wraps up. It lingers with you. I played this game when it came out on the Playstation 3. I rented it. I took it back to Blockbuster. (That's how long ago it was!) And I've been thinking about it ever since. I saw it in the store last week (LAST WEEK) and debated repurchasing it because it was such an amazing game but I heard about it coming out on Steam. I own thousands of games, and this is one game out of a few that have stuck with me emotionally.   If you want a game that will most likely punch you in the heart and then comfort it, play Valkyria Chronicles. Because, really. When is the next game that is going to give you feelings going to come out? They are few and far between.   Also, just play if you're a Skies of Arcadia fan. You'll see."

"What is arguably Sega's best PS3 game, and one of Sega's best games altogether, gets a PC port worthy of its name. The game looks and plays better than ever on PC, and given the low price there's really no reason not to buy this game and support the franchise."
"It runs perfectly on WIndows XP. The game has only crashed once in the six hours I've played, and that's likely due to the aging hardware &amp; drivers on the eight-year-old PC I tested on. This thing is far below the minimum recommended specs, yet it runs like a champ @1280x800.  Compared to the Crazy Taxi port (which explicitly lists XP support) this goes above and beyond the call of duty. Crazy Taxi won't even run properly on the same test machine.  Sega has become much more adept at porting their titles over to the PC platform, and I hope they keep it up."
"I had a great time. Unfortunately it suffers from its anime roots from time to time. Missions tend to be long, sometimes a half hour or more. It starts to cause problems in the midgame.   Chapters 7 and 14 in particular were dealbreakers for me. Long cutscenes followed by a very long mission, followed by a nearly invincible enemy spawning and one-shotting me from miles away, requiring me to do it all again. It absolutely took me out of the experience to have to retry a mission 3 or 4 times before I realize that it just isn't possible using any normal tactics and that those missions were all about prepositioning units to deal with insanely overpowered enemies that havent spawned yet, or else rely on an AI enemy or ally that is similarly overpowered but inconsistent.  The gameplay is hella fun, the story is actually great, and the art style is capital F - Fantastic so it's absolutely worth playing. Just be aware that sometimes the game wants you to jump through hoops instead of shoot people. Don't be afraid to look up a guide if a mission seems to be impossible, especially on the two chapters I mentioned."
"Wow, this is an absolutely *epic* masterpiece that is simply one of the best games on Steam. This is honestly not just a must-play for strategy and JRPG fans, but everyone with a Steam account. I'd like to give a few of the reasons why this game is so great, and I'll close with a couple of slight nitpicks that are good to be aware of before you start to play. Overall, just buy this game!  + The tactical strategy/action battle system is really unique. The game is turn based, but you get to manually control your individual units, so you can place them behind cover, duck down into tall grass, get into position, fire, and then scramble back behind a rock or friendly tank. You’ll be able to command your units’ actions at a very detailed level. It's really satisfying to play a turn-based strategy game where you have so much control over your troops.  + The level of mission variety is incredibly impressive. It's never just about killing all the enemy troops or seizing the enemy camp. You'll sneak through enemy lines with a wounded comrade, slow the advance of a monstrous tank, storm a castle, fight in the trenches, etc. Every mission is different and you always need to stay on your toes.  + Beautiful and unique art style. It looks like a storybook in motion, the character designs are instantly iconic, and your entire company of troops has tons of personality.  + The story is fantastic. It’s quite thoughtful about war, death, camaraderie, and racism. It was really interesting to find that Welkin isn’t the typical anime hero who complains and whines about battle and fighting until he is forced to change his mind. He’s a scientist and a student, but he knows the stakes and he’s committed to the fight from the very start. The art style may seem very “anime”, but the storytelling doesn’t really have any of the “Shinji no baka!” and “Kyaa!” type of stuff that you may be dreading. There are a few brief apperances from a kind of mascot animal and, admittedly, a scene at the beach, but all that is handled with relative taste. Overall, if you like anime/manga war stories like the original Gundam, Gundam 8th MS Team, Macross, or Legend of the Galactic Heroes, this will be right up your alley.  + So much content. The game is long, challenging, and packed with story and things to do. In addition to the main missions, you get skirmish missions to train your troops, and you can unlock extra story chapters, some of which will give you new missions to play. You also automatically get the two DLC missions, which are great. There's a lot here to keep you busy!  + You can play the entire game in either the really good English dub or with the original Japanese voices.  = In order to get the best rank in each mission, the game wants you to complete the mission in a certain number of turns, which usually means that you need to play in a very particular way. I didn't really mind...it depends on how much you care about getting S ranks on everything. It's also true that, if you don't care about your rank, you're pretty much open to play each mission however you want, and you can win in all sorts of ways and with many different deployment options. This will mostly come down to how you like to play.  - The RNG can sometimes be a little funky. It’s frustrating to miss a practically point-blank shot with your lance or tank cannon. This gets better as your units level up, but there will be a few annoying 'how did I miss that shot?' moments.  - The subtitles for the Japanese language mode are actually 'dubtitles'...you're given a transcription of the English dub line, which isn't always exactly what the Japanese-voiced character is saying."
"Great game, much swag. All characters of this game blaze only the pure og dank kush"
that's dope.
Griszle: this game Griszle: is so weeaboo Griszle: its unreal Griszle: he talks to fish in the first 5 mins Griszle: wth Griszle: unreasonble arrest Griszle: the hell is this anime ♥♥♥♥ Griszle: also Griszle: theyre proper ♥♥♥♥ at shooting Griszle: like on par with stormtroopers Griszle: (PLAYING VALKRIA CHRONICLES BTW) Griszle: cheesy dialogue 101 Griszle: 'ill do whatever it takes to protect the people of this town' Griszle: narrator reads proper slow too Griszle: also alicia and welkin gonna bang???

"Story wise: It's like going to McDonald for a hamburger. They deliver, and you get what you ordinarily expect out of a hamburger. It's no Mass Effect but you'll go home happy with a warm fuzzy feeling in your chest, with some fond memories of that chip with the right amount of crispness.    Gameplay: You enter a new restaurant not expecting anything in particular, you have some general ideas what you're getting, but the place bears little resemblance to your usual food joints. They deliver. Not the usual 5-course meal that you come to expect with X-COM but with different and no less compelling twists and turns. Once you know how the different elements of your dish come together, it's easy to swallow everything in a bite. Some say it ruins the enjoyment but others take delight at finding out about such method.   Alicia is a regular Lebron."
"Good Story, beautiful pencil colored animation,"
"I have played it in PS3 when it originally came out. I bought it again on PC, that should tell you something."
"BUY IT, RUNS SMOOTH ON PC, NO LAG EXPERIENCED, IF YOU LIKE TURN BASED WWII THIS IS A GAME FOR YOU TO GET. IF U LIKE ANIME THIS IS ALSO A GAME TO GET. GALLIA TO ARMS ~!!  CONTROLS WORKS FINE FOR MOUSE AND KEYBOARD AS WELL."
Best Valkyria Chronicles of the series. All we need now are the other two VC games. Made a full team of girls. 10/10 would harem again. Jann best girl.
"Sega should have kept making games if they were all like this one. The battle system in this is awesome. The story is good and hooks you emotionally. Not sure how I missed out on this one in the past, but I am damn happy I got to play through it. Even if the story doesnt get you, that battle system will. Can't count the amout of times I was holding my breath hoping for good RNG. Thankfully this also has in battle saves..... Fantastic game."
"If you managed to take a turn-based tactics game that merged the mercenary management of Jagged Alliance along with the research management of XCOM, and then set it in WWII, you'd have something that pretty closely resembles Valkyria Chronicles. While I have a love/hate relationship with the gameplay and the graphics are looking slightly dated nowadays, there's no denying that overall, I enjoyed Valkyria Chronicles. I'm glad they decided to release the game for PC and hope Sega decide to release more Valkyria titles on PC in the future.   http://www.choicestgames.com/2016/02/valkyria-chronicles-review.html "
"I just love this game so much. The story has that charming 'ancient power awakens that will decide the outcome of the war' thing going on, which is an RPG trope that I personally never tire of. But the thing about JRPGs is that their plots and lore are never the interesting thing about them, it's the characters and their personalities and the way they grow and change together. And that's simply perfect in this game. All the characters have real pasts, plans for the future, attitudes, quirks, and feel like real human beings.   Moreover, the character units which in most SRPGs are just clones are instead people with their own biographies, voice actors, lines of dialogue, and even personality traits that actually affect gameplay. This helps you connect so much more with your squad and helps you really care about them. My favourite of the optional squad members is Ramsey, the ill-motivated engineer who always acts like she'd rather be doing anything other than her job.  The game is overall so vibrant and animated, the art style is beautiful, the characters live and breathe, and the storyline, even though it's a bit cheesy and contrived, simply serves as a vehicle for getting to know the characters better. It even brought a tear to my eye on a few occasions, which is what a good JRPG is supposed to do, after all.  The dual audio is a good feature. I'm playing with Japanese audio to make it feel even more like watching an anime, and I'd recommend that to anyone who thinks they might enjoy that kind of thing.  Pick this up if you like SRPGs or traditional JRPGs, or both."
"BUY IT, RUNS SMOOTH ON PC, NO LAG EXPERIENCED, IF YOU LIKE TURN BASED WWII THIS IS A GAME FOR YOU TO GET. IF U LIKE ANIME THIS IS ALSO A GAME TO GET. GALLIA TO ARMS ~!!  CONTROLS WORKS FINE FOR MOUSE AND KEYBOARD AS WELL."

If you like xcom and if you love RPGs you will love the ♥♥♥♥ out of this ♥♥♥♥. You will love it even more if you like the 1930s if it was fantasy.
This game is mad addictive and loads of fun.  It's also a dece port.   Expect a more detailed review once I actually finish it.
You mockin' the power of vegetables?!
"Valkyria Chronicles is by far one of the best games i have played:  - The story: is amazing, sure you have your 'anime 101' some enjoy it and some dont. The story is a reinterpretation of WW2, with fantasy added to the story. as Juck Fames puts in his review: you will enter looking for fun but will emerge with feels  - Gameplay: is a mix between 3rd person shooter and turn based strategy (3rd person x-com i've seen people call it). This sort of combat gets you in closer to the battle instead of just seeing everying from up high, and for me personally being able to control my Squad in 3rd person helped me feel more attached and bring the feeling of war far better. Unlocking special orders you can issue during combat for granting various bonuses is not only immersive but strategically important as you go along to put it in short: Your squad will die without orders from their commander.  - The characters: you as a commander of Squad 7 is put in charge of gathering a fighting force and there is easily more than 40 different characters you can recruit into your squad each with their own name, backstory, strengths and weaknesses. Each character will have set of 'perks' showing strengths and weaknesses for example some characters might have 'Sand allergy' and thus thinking about bringing that particular unit to a desert battle is not a good idea as it will result in damage over time for due to the allergy but brining a 'City born' to a fight in the city will increase his/hers defense. These characters can die on the field of battle and thus you will have to replace lost soldiers.  - each battle scenario is scored with a grade A,B,C etc. and based on your grade the more XP and Currency you will recieve. I am not a huge fan of that as it temps the player to find the quickest way to complete a scenario(you dont have to look far on youtube before you can find a guide that shows which maps can be completed in 1 turn) but i can see the enjoyment of hunting A grades after completing the game therefor i would recommend when first playing this game to take it a bit slower and plan you moves.  10/10 - Im off to do a 2nd playthrough! Squad 7, Move out!!"
" Valkyria Chronicles feels unique, looks gorgeous and is blessed with a great PC port, but its punishingly slow gameplay, unengaging story and jilted controls ultimately ruin what could have been a grand tactical adventure."
"Imperials threaten to kill everyone because they want some precious stone.  But some man told me of this vegetable crisis and how people were hungry. They weren't here to some stupid rock, but MY vegetables.  So I drove a tank and murdered them.   10/10."

i would like to thank the lord for porting this to the pc
Beautiful game with excellent gameplay and good plot.
"The best PS3 JRPG on Steam, ported with love."
"Valkyria Chronicles is better than sliced bread. And I was pretty hyped for slice bread too.  Valkyria Chronicles is a quality tactical turn based third person shooter, a concept unique in its own right and near groundbreaking during the time of its original release. The game is set in a world war II environmen drawing heavily on real world issues to fuel the story with that fantasy JRPG flair to it. The environments and artstyle have that cell shaded appearance and makes the world more immersive and allows the game to age like a fine wine.   The gameplay mixes turn based combat where either side moves their troops and takes turns going after one another. When it is your turn, you actively take control of your soldiers in a third person shooter style, whereby you move based on your stats and then enter a firing mode. The gameplay is mission based and the story component is told through cutscenes and mission dialogue, the mix works well athough it does seem a bit disjointed in terms of the journal setup. The classes are all moderately balanced although you will typically just focus on select characters as they 'carry the fight' and the character cast makes every soldier feel unique. The cast of characters each have their own backstory with priority given to those in the main story arch of course, however completionists will enjoy utilizing all the characters and trying out multiple approaches to beat the missions.   Full recommendation, regardless of whether you are a fan or this knd of genre or not, has tactical, JRPG, and WWII stylized elements all combined in the perfect blend to create an unforgettable gaming experience."
9/10  -1 for filthy Darcsen scum

"if switzerland moved to the netherlands area and had to have a child military to fend off the germans during wwii, and also had a government like luxembourg (constitutional monarchy/grand duchy)"
World War II: The Anime: The Game. 10/10 best fish sketches I've ever seen
I love this game
i highly reccomend this game. YOU LIKE ANIME?? HOW BOUT XCOM? HOW BOUT ABIT OF COMPANY OF HEROS? WELL THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU MEIN FRIEND buy this game its worth the 14 bucks on sale
"This game will make you feel like a boss, and the second you feel that way they will hit you with the harsh reality of war and make you hate life. SOUNDS FUN HUH?! 10/10."
"Let's put out the negative point this game has first, which is the extremely awful tank controls like how you can suddenly have the Edelweiss and Shamrock violently shaking at the slighest push of the wasd. This can easily result in you losing your precious energy bar ridiculously quickly. However, aside from that, I see no other negative point of the game.   The story itself has a nice blend of military action, fantasy and romance.  The game itself has an interesting and fitting art style, with a 'pencil shade' sort of effect applied which gives the game the impression that it's being told from a book, which it actually is and it is not the sort of realistic looking graphics you see in video games these days. Even though the game has third person shooter elements in it, it still retains the strategy aspect of the game. When you start the game, you realise that your units if used wrongly can be taken out easily, forcing players to strategise and plan out their next moves instead of recklessly rushing in to kill off the enemies.  I could go on and on about the positive points but I feel that the points mentioned are the main aspects that I really love about the game. Hopefully they release the PC ports for the second and third installments soon :)"
"10/10 'its like skyrim with guns but turn based' IGN   The good:  -strong story that keeps you interested -Well developed characters including the 200+ side characters (Can remember the whole squads names, likes, firends etc. I could name maybe 4 characters in the whole of skyrim and tell you nothing about them by comparison) -Blend of turn based combat/ RPG progression/ 3rd person action. (these three things mesh perfectly to keep gameplay interesting and skill not just stat based. -Includes all the dlc packs. (actually a ♥♥♥♥ ton of new content)  The bad: -running the game at higher than 30 fps increases the amount units counter attack for some reason (console physics) basically making the game 'hard mode', turning the frame rate higher than 60fps eg 120 fps makes it almost unplayable. Not really an issue just make sure you cap the frame rate at 60 fps. -720p pre-rendered cutscenes. There arn't too many so its not an issue. -certain tactics are downright broken making certain challenging missions super easy ( don't watch guides or you will learn these exploits and break the game) -Lots of upgrades need to be done between missions, can be annoying sometimes.  Overall:  Its a linear story driven game I played for longer than Dragon age Inquisiition. Thats all that needs to be said 10/10"
I can't stop watching these Chinese cartoons.
"I would recommend this game for various reasons:    It has a great story    It has an innovative gameplay mechanic    The art and graphics are done in a beautiful way    It's a great PC port, so the masterrace can play this game without any worries.   "
"This game is hard to find for the PS3 (it was never released digitally on PSN), so it's great to have an option to play it on PC. A good port, with only the low-res cinematic movies being it's only downside. Great if you like strategy and waifus."
"If you like turn based strategy RPG games, this one is a must play! Beautiful artstyle, interesting story and unique combat control makes it a worthwhile buy to add to your game library and it comes with all the DLC the PS3 version have~"
"Very fun game with adorable characters, but it is quite challenging after the first few levels! I have been stuck on the 7th chapter now and have died many many times on this single map (wont spoil it for those who havent played it).   Pros:  The game is very fun in many different ways. The story, though seemingly blending elements of World War II and Final Fantasy a little too closely, is very fun. The gameplay is balanced and this game's length will provide for months of never-ending entertainment.    The anime-themed look of the game's environments and characters work extremely well in 3D; the rendering engine the game uses is superb.    Even though it's an anime-styled game, it doesn't have any of that cliche 'kawaii'/'hot anime girls' garbage that's seen so often in mainstream Japanese Anime culture. The game's content is surprisingly conservative really. It's well-fit for all ages.    The English dubbing of the game is excellent; the voices are superb. No translation errors with spelling or grammar either.    Excellent storyline; you will be very immersed in the game's world after only a short amount of time playing it. The developers put a great deal of good thought and effort into the storyline and the game's universe.    Characters are very well-developed. They all have their own detailed biographies and personalities. You bond with them very deeply as the game progresses, and it can almost be heartbreaking when any one of them dies in battle.    Plays slightly similar to XCOM but with a minor FPS flare (units are not fixed to grids; they can move wherever they want freely.    The enemy AI is quite clever in how it becomes more difficult and adapts to the player's tactics as the game progresses. Any time they permanently kill one of your soldiers (by capturing them when they are unconscious), it makes you feel heartbroken and full of rage at the enemy.    The different gameplay classes are well-balanced and fun to play.    All DLCs from the PS3 version are automatically included. No 'pay an additional $20 for this extra little gameplay package' nonsense.    Game has practically no bugs at all.    Cons:  This list may seem fairly extensive but really the pros are still much stronger. These are all minor complaints. The game's drawbacks are mostly functionality/GUI issues. The actual gameplay and storyline are fantastic and they are the reason why this game is so good. Nevertheless, be wary of these problems if you buy the game:    No multiplayer mechanics; game is exclusively singleplayer. This is considerably disappointing considering the potential it could have as an online strategy game between players.    No escape menus in-game; exiting normally from the game takes a while.    This game requires a lot of patience and forgiveness from the player. Battles take a very long time, and if you lose a battle, you must repeat the whole battle all over again from the beginning (30-120 minutes per battle gameplay time). Very frustrating on the more difficult game levels.    The game has a lot of menus for all different things. A little too many.    Menu GUIs are somewhat unfriendly for a computer with a mouse; all menu operations have to be done using a keyboard, shifting and scrolling through options slowly with way too many keys, rather than a simple click of the mouse.    For a game that has waited some 6-7 years to be finally ported to PC, very few (if any) improvements to the game's graphics have been made.    Controls for moving tanks are quite difficult, and using your mouse to maneuver the tank wastes a ton of movement ability.    Most game config options can only be changed by launching a separate program; this means you cannot simply exit from gameplay real quick and change the control scheme. You have to turn off the whole game and go change the settings separately, then relaunch it. Pretty annoying if you forget the controls.    The game claims to have a war cemetery 'place' that you can visit where you can see the graves and whatnot of your fallen soldiers, but when you go to it, all it lets you do is talk to this old man whose only purpose is to sell you battle abilities. The developers of the game really missed a good opportunity there for players to be able to connect more deeply with the game's characters and story.    Severe bug that disables the computer monitor when you exit out of the game via the windows home button and then try to re-enter the game. The monitor will go black and you will never be able to fix it unless you manually shut down your computer and restart it. Ctrl-alt-delete sometimes works but the last time it happened to me, not even that was able to stop the monitor blackout.   All in all, this is a game that you should not miss out on. Get it! You won't regret it. I certainly don't!"
"This is the reason why I felt justified in being an early adopter of the PS3, and it definitely still holds up after all these years. Valkyria Chronicles uses an interesting blend of real-time and turn-based strategy for its battles, and it works extremely well. Unlike games like X-COM, Valkyria Chronicles is more character-focused; each unit has a unique personality and you become attached to each one of them - it's quite a bit better than Fire Emblem's 'acquire-and-forget' mentality. They all have strengths and flaws in the form of potentials.  Also, the art style is great. I really can't recommend this game enough."
One of PS3's best and most unique games now on steam with a solid port.
"In general, I hate war games. I just bought this one because it had a female protagonist and a good price, and for the first time I've played, I just could not turn off the computer for the entire night!  Everything about this game is incredible: the storyline, the music and, mainly, the awesome battle in turns and strategy, it's just fantastic. It offers you a good level of difficulty, and doesn't matter how many times you die until you get all mission with rank A because the graphics are so marvelous that you just don´t get tired of playing it.  And yes, it's a war game with a lot of female characters (who fancies both men and women), and this is just awsome.  Everyone should try this game for sure!"
"Story: 8/10  Interesting alternate reality WW 1/2 setting with a little extra sci-fi/fantasy-ish additions. Well fleshed out, but not mind-blowing.  Characters: 10/10  Diverse, interesting and realistic characters all around. Really enjoy them.  Graphics: 9/10  Beautiful anime-style graphics in a drawn-looking style. only 9 points because of ps3-quality cutscenes.  Gameplay: 10/10  This one's pretty subjective. If you like strategy rpgs á la Fire Emblem, FF tactics, XCOM, Wasteland, etc, you will probably enjoy it as much as i do.    tl;dr: If you like strategy rpgs and/or anime-style games, this one's a no brainer, probably one of the best out there. Well worth its 20€ and (imo) much more enjoyable than most AAA titles!"
"Fire Emblem meets World War II. I'm in love. So glad I got this at 50% off, but even at 20 your getting your monies worth."
"A great game and dynamic turn based strategy game with awesome level design.  Ranking system is a bit abitrary. Kill all units? Get extra objectives? Who cares? Just finish as fast as possible. Towards the mid game it gets pointlessly grindy though. Hits being pure % based (like any strategy game) but the game never informing you of this fact (no stat info for actual chance to hit).  But the game as a whole from the story and the feel, it is great."
"A Very Good and Overlooked Real-Time Tactics Game, Valkyria Chronicles is a PS3 port to PC which in my own opinion transfered pretty greatly (Besides the save options being in PS3 overlay style and menu systems being odd to navigate) I have no real complaints about gameplay and or anything regarding to characters the story may not be as appealing if you're not into a WW2 type settings.  Overall I would give Valkyria Chronicles a big 9/10 for being a solid and well put together port with minor menu issues and being an a fun game overall.  P.S. if you do plan on picking up the game, Jann Walker one of the members you can put into Squad 7 is a must have he will pretty much make everything you do action wise halrious and even more enjoyable."
"I haven't actually played much of this game, maybe an hour or two, but I feel compelled to share my awe at how the characters in this game react to a full-scale invasion of their country. Everyone's always smiling as they stroll down the street, and regard war almost as though it were a weather event. 'The enemy can't be far behind, but I wanted to apologize for yesterday and baked you this bread. Tee-hee.' (girls must not let minor things such as war get in the way of flirting with the new boy in town)  The amount of optimism displayed is no less incredible: 'I'm sure the village guard (or whatever they call it) will fend off the attackers! Oh look, the old windmill. Sure makes you feel at home, doesn't it?' Are these people r3tarded? There's a g0ddamned army steamrolling the nation, but what the hell - there's always time to stop and smell the flowers. Let us have a picnic, shall we? Then, when the tanks roll in and start blasting down buildings, they go 'I can't believe it!'. *sigh*  Thank you, Japan. That being said, the gameplay is pretty fun, and mixes turn-based strategic combat with real time FPS action. It is quite interesting. I'll probably update this review after I play some more."
It feels like a combination of Fire Emblem and France in 1944. 20/10 would have Marth drive a tank again.
"A cross between Fire Emblem and X-COM, and it is absolutely great. You'll find yourself getting attached to your squad members and get moments where you go 'Don't you dare die on me! I'm sending in a rescue squad to save you now!'.  Lots of variety in the characters too - multiple classes, different personality traits and squad members they get along with."
"A fun tactical rpg. Some missions do get fairly difficult depending on how content you are with poor or good results. Biggest gripe would probably be that the translations are inaccurate at times. Some characters do have slightly differing personalities in English than compared to Japanese, but its not a big enough concern for me."
I own this game. Like I bought it for the ps3 and I still bought it again. BECAUSE ITS FREAKING FANTASTIC! Do you love strategy and action but want a beautiful story that will infect you with the feels. (I actually shed a tear for one of the bad guys. Seriously this game will wreck you.) So shut up and just buy it.
"Fantastic strategy port by SEGA. Amazing art, great compelling story and interesting gameplay pretty much fulfills all the criteria for a great game. Even on normal difficulty some missions can provide quite a challenge and the ability to customise your squad and recover and swap weapons is really fun, even if nearly all the enemy weapons are terrible compared to the ones you can research. I would heartily recommend this game for anyone looking for a fun turn based strategy game loosely based on World War 1."
"by finishing the game, i has already completed the whole media of this franchise (beside the VC 2 and 3) manga (Gallian Chronicles : Valkyria of the Battlefield) anime (Valkyria Chronicles) and the game itself  For the gameplay, You can beat the game for +/- 40 hours of gameplay if you don't decide to accomplish all of the achievement. This turn-based mechanism is quite interesting by separating characters into 5 classes : scout, trooper, sniper, engineer, and lancer with their own pluses and minuses. You need to arrange the right composition of the army to get the best result of the battle (of course you need to get A rank for every map you met). The abilities for each character also drawn my attention Each character has their own story that related to other characters example: if there's a character who had a grudge or hating a spesific character, their ability will develop into hater. and vice versa, if there's a characters who had feelings to other characters, their ability will develop into lover.  For the story, I can find this game has many possibilities of stories, full of emotion and of course a taste of unrequited love you will find yourself neutral in this journey, from Gallian side and for the Empire side  for the music, there's nothing special beside the battle-theme-songs to encouraging and boost your morale in battlefield  to conclude this preview, i want to say that this game is worth to be played and if you are an achievement maniac, the completion for all achievements will be exciting"
"This was a fantastically made game back when it was originally released on the PS3, and it's still an amazing experience now on PC. Of course, I would have expected nothing less from the wonderful minds that brought us  Skies of Arcadia  on the Dreamcast some years before - and it was great to see that the little Easter Egg of Vyse and Aika from that game making an appearance in this one was still there. Naturally, being an avid fan of that game, I made sure they were both in my squad &lt;3   This game does an amazing job of weaving together gorgeous visuals, excellent characterisation, a compelling storyline, and a beautiful soundtrack. It's not without its flaws, certainly, but neither is any great masterpiece - and that is, after all, what this game is. The asking price is exceptional for a title of this calibre, especially given the amount of content the game has to offer. I am only about 30-ish hours in so far myself, and I know I am likely not even halfway through the game yet.   Honestly, if you're at all unsure about it, take the plunge. You'll thank yourself later."
"A unique strategy game that perfectly blends real time strategy, turn based strategy, 3rd person shooter, and RPG elements. To top it all off, the art style of the game is really pretty and anime-ish, which I liked a lot. The story is also really well done. All of the characters in the game, even the non-main characters of your squad, have unique backgrounds that really fleshes them out as characters and sort of helps you form a bond with them. Really liked this part for it is something not found in many games. Btw, there is an option to use either the Japanese or English voices for those who don't like dubs.  One thing I don't like though is that you can't skip or fast forward through the enemy's turn so you are just gonna have to sit there and bear with it. The tank controls can be a bit difficult, which costs you to use up AP unneccesarily. I heard this isn't a problem when using a controller though. Other than these complaints, this game is perfect!"
"A great game, with lots of personality and charm. It's history seems to be well written and it strongly reminds WWII, even in some gear design.  Gameplay is fun and engaging, although until now I've only seen the basics of it. But nevertheless is a challenging game! If you fancy turn-based strategy games, this one is a good try."
"TLDR; There is a reason why this game was ported.  I love this game. I played it when it first came out on PS3 and picked it back up again through steam, thus beating it again. The game mechanics is what brings this game together. Want to use your one scout to take out an army? Go for it. How about a well thought out stratagy to kill everyone in one turn, and pick some flowers along the way? It has it. Just go play the **** thing, and see for yourself why they brought this game to steam."
"Having played Valkyria Chronicles on the PS3, i can only recommend it for everyone that is a fan of original, round based 3rd person strategy.  My personal challenge will be to not ONLY use Alicia to get all the A ranks. &gt;_&lt;  I was a little surprised getting all the DLC too, but that's something i didn't do on the PS3, so i look forward doing that.  "
"One of its kind strategy game, although needs some work with balance. It's story is also good, but it still falls for a couple ani-may tropes which ruins immersion at times."
i love that story..
Awesome Game and one of the best Ports to PC!!!
"I'm writing this review rather late, but here goes.  This game is fantastic. I love it. There's nothing I can really complain about. Everything is paced well, all the classes and the characters feel whole. It's a great port from PS3 there's nothing wrong with this game. It's story is interesting, it's about a fictional WW2 that discriminates on Darcsens instead of Jews. The Empire are basically the Germans and they're coming to invade and even have concentration camps set up. The gameplay is fantastic the battles are unique and the maps look awesome.  I can only hope they decide to put maybe the second or third game on Steam but that's very unlikely. The second game was the worst in the series (but I don't think it was bad it just pales in comparison to 2 and 3,) and the third game never made it into english, (but there's a fan translation out there that works pretty well for owners of PSPs.)"
This is a great game. It has an anime not-quite-WWII setting. The gameplay is a series of turn-based tactical combat missions. The combat includes a 3rd-person real-time movement mechanic that I haven't seen before (and really like). There are 23 main story missions and 5 side mission that unfold as chapters in a book. Each mission is accompanied by several (skippable) cut scenes that tell a well a really nice story. XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a great game with a similar combat system - I like this game better.
"Let me start by saying this game is definitely a must play if you are a fan of the strategy genre and want a storyline.   Pros: Story was great, music score was very well done, the tactical aspects of the game were generally satisfactory, and finally the characters were what brought this series to life. The art is also something I found refreshing and well-done though it may not appeal to those who are not a fan of the paintbrush watercolor art style.   Cons: As with many console ports the controls can be a bit cumbersome, but I found even without rebinding keys that I didn't have a problem after an hour or so. As well some of the mechanics may not always make sense but that comes with the turn-based genre. While the music was good I found there was a lack in variety but it may not bother most people.  Overall: For the price (even without a sale) it was well worth my ~30 hours. I highly recommend this game to anyone who has the patience for a strategy game with a solid storyline."
"An awsome game! And gets even better if you play the game in original Japanese voice (available in setting). And don't worry, you can still play the game as all the text and subtitles are in English.  Never played Japanese games? well, here's a good one to start with.  Good story, good machanic and eventhough its a few years old, felt as good as any new games out there.   In playing this game, some of you might get fustrated by some over-achievers enemy and such, but that's kind of force you to push your imagination further in order to solves the situations which is nice and challenging.   Speaking of cons, during individual battles you can't save! (could before though) And that could ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off as a some battle took quite a while and failing mean repeating the whole thing including Mid Battle Cinematic and dialogues.  But on the up side, That's probably it that might stop any you from finishing the game in one go (Sleeping recommend)."
I wish you could skip enemy turns. But other than that this game is awsome. Played 9 hours straight the first night i bought it
"A memorable game. Fun, challenging, and well optimized for its PC port, Valkyria Chronicles will engage you in a war you never knew you wanted to fight. It takes the best from Third Person shooters and Real Time Strategy games and mixes them together to form an amazing game.   Highly recommended.  Also includes all PS3 DLC."
"This turned out to be a lot better than I expected, well worth the purchase."
How can i possibly review a game that is simply perfect?  Like JRPGs with an epic storyline and simple and easy turn based tactical TPS play style?  Then this game is for you. 10/10
"Thematically, it's like Advance Wars and Fire Emblem got together and had a love child. A heavy dose of tsundere and cringingly corny dialogue, and you have yourself Valkyria Chronicles.  Every soldier on the battlefield is a separate character, with a separate class, personality, different stats and buffs, and different terrain preferences (Ex. sniper Catherine is extremely ammo-conscious, and firing her last bullet will give her multiple stat penalties). Everyone has their own backstory and playstyle, making for an impressive number of combinations with a relatively small roster. (They even have separate voice actors).  The actual gameplay is very solid, while also presenting a very unique mechanic. Each mission is played out in turns, but as each unit is moved, there is real-time reaction fire, forcing you to act quickly *while moving*, but still allowing every action to be deliberate.  A great strategy game, but only for those who can muster an appreciation for the anime/JRPG influences; otherwise, the abundance of quality writing and storytelling will be lost on you.  Lack of a multiplayer option limits replayability, but still worth it."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a really fun game, with an amazing story, awesome theme and great gameplay.  BUT! Be warned! If you don't like random chances, unlucky shots and fatal consiquences based on both skill and even more luck then DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!   It will frustrate you to death, because a random dice roll can throw away hours of earned gameplay, unless you save constantly. But if you can somehow get beyond that, this game is really wonderful."
"I'm waiting for VC 2 and 3 to be released here on steam.   For me it is really really good, it resembles me a lot Advance Wars (turns-based war-strategy game for gameboy advance and DS) but here you can move freely and in third person, it is great :D"
"AN awesome game! Played the PS3 version and I'm happy to relive the memories on PC! BUY IT! THe story is amazing, the music is great, the learning curve isn't steap and the action RPG is just right!"
Visually it is very good. I also enjoy the story and the book form of event presentation. The battles are turn based and in a style original to this game. I like the game.
"Never wrote a review, but this game really made me wanna do it.  First of all, I bought this game for 2 reasons: It's a RPG, and I liked the idea, when it was on sale I went for it. Jackpot. Pros: This game is great, the story, the characters, main ones and the sides, to the point I didn't change my original squad, except once, because I didn't want anyone to leave. As for the gameplay It gives you a nice challange mostly on the later stages that can get quite hard. Also, the way the combat is handled is really strategic, and feels good to play. Cons: For me the only thing I thought was missing was some more ways to interact with the squad members, and the 'encyclopedia' was not enought for me.  Some people may be turned down by the pace, since it's just either cutscenes or battle, but it wasn't an issue for me since nowdays it seems like cutscenes are forgotten. *cof* (MGSV) *cof*  At the end I loved the game, good story, good tatical combat and when you finish it, you feel accomplished. Go buy it! "
A wonderful take on turn based combat with varied missions. Each individual in your squad has personality and character which translates into gameplay fairly well. The progression of both skill and development in weapons/tech feels right and never too slow. Very colorful and vibriant as well.
"I haven't played a JRPG this fun, innovative and with such a deep and interesting lore since Final Fantasy Tactics. You WILL get attached to your units, you WILL care for the story and you absolutely WILL have your skills tested leading your squad. I've barely scratched the surface and I can't get enough."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a good game but, could’ve been a lot better.  Gameplay/Mechanics – First off, soldiers are leveled according to their class rank. That means everyone is dispensable and the only thing you lose is their hidden potentials. If we had a standard leveling system like Fire Emblem, I would’ve cared a lot more for my boys. Secondly, orders are ♥♥♥♥ing OP as ♥♥♥♥. *Goes to chapter 12, uses caution and demolition on Alicia, rush through to the end of the level, kill enemies in camp, occupy camp, ?????, profit. Thirdly, I’m fine with having a standard model gun for every class but can’t we have special weapons? Like good ones and not the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ guns that Cordelia gives you. “The game’s more strategy than RPG” is all I’m saying.   Story – It’s good, moving on.  Characters – There’s only four characters, Welkin, Alicia, Largo, and Rosie. The rest are nobodies that barely affect the plot except for Faldio. They’re all above average characters except Rosie. If you want to learn more about your units, better go to the skirmish, select Welkin, aim at his/her head, shoot, call medic, ????, profit. The biography system is underwhelming. I was thinking “that’s it?” when I first played through the campaign.  Soundtrack – The soundtrack is good; it fits the mood pretty well.  Graphics – Wait, Valkyria Chronicles is 16gb because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 720p cutscenes? WTF? How’d they ♥♥♥♥ this up? If it’s gonna be uncompressed and unhindered, WTF ISN’T IT IN 1080P??? Otherwise, it’s game from 2008, what’d you expect?  Overall – 7/10 Jann X Largo 4life… "
The unit abilities make sense and let you build solutions to the levels like puzzles. The PC port is very solid and doesn't crash. Never gets boring.
"Nice game anyway, if u like RPG and like War strategy game, this game maybe suitable for u"
"This is one kind of a game! Is like mixing the good turn-based RPG style with some aiming/strategy/shooting action!! You really feel in a battlefield with all the nice sound effects (such as your allies calling for help or asking if you are alright!), the difficulty is a bit harder than expected but that is one of the good things!, you actually have to think what your next move is gonna be! (take a risk or play safe) even a single turn wasted could change everything!. Aside from all the sweet gameplay the history is pretty nice, is like watching an anime with a good plot...some drama, love, friendship, etc.  Well to end this, I will just say that i played like 25 hours to just get to the end of the game (damn that freaking last boss is hard as hell). So if you love fire emblem/ advanced wars rpg you really need to buy this! don't even think it twice!"
"Great visuals, surprisingly compelling gameplay, and a fantastic soundtrack make up for a so-so story and characters, and perhaps a bit too much finnicky micromanagement. Also interesting (and very rare) to see a WWII-themed game at least try and address the Holocaust in some way. Also, if you're a bit thick like me, a handy tip - there's no autosave, but you can save your game during a mission."
"Great mix between anime and WW2, turn based fun gameplay and squad customization. all memmbers have unique personalites along with skill sin an RPG type system and it makes for a very engaging story"
"Game, despite its age, is still pretty good and fun to play, and here is a friendly tip, avoid picking susie as a scout, she have humanterian potential wich could prevent her from attacking foot soldiers x.x, everyone else for your squad are good.  this game also come with its expension packs, so its a no brainer to get it if its on sale :3"
"This game is amazing. It's one of those games I can spend hours on without realizing it. I like the characters, art style, gameplay, story, difficulty (Clearing mission is so satifying in this game and the missions never felt like they were impossible to complete.) I could go on. This game is a definite must-have."
"Already loving it. I am barely 1 hr. in, but the playstyle, the story, all of it flows together wonderfully."
"Just finished the game, I felt like all those hours were well spent. And now I'm after achievements and getting the rest of the story missions to A. Would and have recommend to friends who haven't tried it yet. The thing that annoyed me a little bit was the tank controls, and frigging aiming RNG.. but otherwise nothing a little save and load can't fix. This game made me roll in feelings, I may have actually cried once or twice over the story. Memorable characters, great character, story and relationships development. Thank you soo much for bringing it to PC.   I hope to see other Valkyria Chronicles here too.  *NOT-SO-SUBTLE-HINT*  "
"Starts off slow, but after you get used to the mechanics it is a ton of fun. Combat has a nice mix of 3rd person shooting and turn based combat think Xcom-X-Residenit Evil 4. Ontop of that has a ton of dumb rpg menus you can play around in. Ima play a bunch of this game."
"I bought this game because I saw a friend playing it for a few minutes, and thought it was interesting even though I don't usually go for turn based strategy games like this. It was on sale for like...$4 so I thought 'what the hell', and bought it. Finished it about an hour ago, and I have that sunk feeling like after reading a really good book, or playing a good game like this 'well what do I do now?'.  Even though the game has its corny moments, I was on such an emotional roller coaster ride from the beginning to the end. I'm pretty sure this game influenced me to feel every different common emotion--happiness, sadness, anger, tranquility, awkwardness, hopelessness, and triumph.  I'll just end it there. If I had to pay full price ($20) for it just to play through it again, I would do it, no questions asked. If a new game was released and I knew that it would give me the emotions and feels that this game did, I would pay the $59.99."
"Absolutely incredible. Sometimes it feels like the game screws you out of a victory by not providing you with enough information soon enough to react, but other than that, it is a truly amazing experience."
"Anyone who has enjoyed a turn-based RPG, a tactical shooter like X-COM, or just a fun story should absolutely treat themselves to Valkyria Chronicles. The core gameplay is a hybrid turn-based shooter but it gives you the freedom to explore different routes and strategies. The story and characters are presented in a wonderful water-color/anime art style embedded in an old fashion story book. Seriously, this game's got everything: action, strategy, and God damn, even a bit of romance. You should stop reading reviews and just buy the thing. For $20, it's an absolute steal."
I origionally bought this game for ps3 and I was so happy that it came to the computer. I hope they add the second game on here as well
"This is recommended game for the JRPG lovers out there. The storyline is very good. There are sad, happy and angry moments in the game. During battles the game can be really intense considering you will be facing heavy tanks, Invulnerable Ship and an Immortal enemy which can bring huge trouble to you and Squad 7. Timing and positioning is also very important as you have limited mobility. Not to mention ammo consuming for Grenades (Scout &amp; Engineer) and Ammunition (Lancers &amp; Snipers). Enemies have good positioning (hiding and movement). As you play this game you should try to unlock and get as many things as you can but it will also vary on your result in the gameplay. DLC's gameplay are also good but far more difficult, DLC's has a side-storyline from both factions which are pretty good and it does have some somewhat funny yet (mildly) disturbing moments and not forgetting hard battles in DLC's. Overall this game is very good and I hope the next Valkyria Chronicles will be out soon."
"I just got into it, but I love this game!"
"10/10 only game where RNG Jesus likes me&lt;3 *also lot of MLG moments* Oh and RIP Oscar, the sniper, nobody likes you"
"When I got this game for the ps3, I never made time to play it. Now that it's been released for the pc, I completed it after a good 50 hours (I tend to take my time with games). My reaction to it is really positive.   Positives  - Beautifull anime styled graphics  - A serious story with some elements inspired from WW2 - Likeable characters  - The gameplay and music - Most missions  - Good port   Mixed - Some parts of the story - Some people will not enjoy the anime like presentation   Cons - Cinematics are in a lower resolution   I liked this game a lot more than I thought. It is also a fine port (higher than 1080p and 60fps) in comparison with the ps3 version which could only produce 720p graphics. It's certainly a game I wish to play again sometime in the future and i hope sega will come around to produce more of this type of game. I can only recommend this game."
"Amazing game, story, artwork and gameplay are all really good."
"The combat system is a combination of FPS and turn-based strategy like X-com. You have a certain number of 'control points' to spend each turn on units. Each unit has a movement meter and can use a weapon for each control point used. So you can move a unit into position, and fire, and if there's any movement left, move them behind cover. This works better for some units, not at all for others (snipers).   The problem comes in the form of difficulty, unknowns, and RNGs.   -Some missions are easy enough to beat in one try. Others take 5+ tries because of hidden units, surprises in the form of hidden tanks, and general RNG aiming. Or the first half of a mission is easy, and the second half is super hard because of endless enemy reinforcements. Or an undefeatable enemy appears that you have to ignore. Or the fact that a certain weapon does significantly more damage than any other against a special boss, but that you could never know to use. -You have to grind 'skirmishes' in order to not be outclassed by enemies by two levels (which means a lot) at al times.  -When you aim rifle/machine gun/lance/sniper/tank gun, you have a small reticule that shots will land within. This is ok, but for medium range shots, you miss 75% of the time because even though you put your crosshair dead on the enemies' head, it will completely miss. This wastes your control point and, if the enemy is within a 'counter attack' range, will be able to shoot back at you.  -Most of the missions require you to simply capture a flag. That's all.   Despite it's shortcomings in design and thought, it's worth a play. But don't pay more than 10$ for it."
"such game, many awesomes"
"A really good game. The interception fire mechanic is what I like the most in this game, as well as the personalities of the soldiers. Very much worth buying with your money and playing the game with your time."
One of the best J-stratagy games out there. Here's hoping to a steam release of part 2 &amp; 3.
"If you are into war games and love tactical play, this Game is for you!!! The wonderful story of the characters as they face even thougher challenges really draws you into the story. Even the backstory of the antagonist( Selevaria Bles) will really draw you in to love the character! The hours spent into trying to win a map is really rewarding and the balance between gameplay and storytelling is there. If you love anime too, this game is for you!!! overall, i rate this game 10/10."
"Such an amazing turn based strategy game. If you're a fan of the genre, don't mine the chineese cartoon aesthetic and jump right in; Valkyria Chronicels has a lot to give in terms of story, depth, strategy, and replayability."
"This was one of my favourite Sony exclusives last gen - great story, atmosphere, characters and game play and full of heart and charm. A must play game!"
Nice game! 8/10 from me
"I really enjoy Valkyria Chronicles, in spite of itself.  I'm going to start with some of the game's flaws:  Navigating the game's menus are terrible.  The story is pretty terrible. The game continually asks 'Are you sure?' after every selection. You have to go back to HQ after EVERY mission to level troops, upgrade weapons, micromanage who is in play. It's great to have cusomization, but sometimes it goes too far.  There is no auto-save, and you have a limit in the number of saves you can have. Scouts become incredibly overpowered as the maps become bigger and bigger. Movement becomes king, and the Randgrizer that elite scots get dominate the game.  In spite of everything, I deeply love this game. It provides an almost X-Com Enemy Unknown level of intrigue. Each level is akin to solving a puzzle. For a wide array of characters, each one does have some personality and you find yourself attached to specific members of your squad. The gameplay in missions and skirmishes makes Valkyria Chronicles shine, in spite of all of its flaws. When you conquer a particuarly frustrating mission, it feels great."
"It's a beatifull game with a brilliant gameplay and a sweet, funny, serious story, but come on guy... 2nd europan war? Most creative writer ;)"
"&gt;spend whole game training shocktroopers &gt;check out command room &gt;whothe♥♥♥♥iswendy.flv &gt;recruit wendy &gt;make wendy violently kill several thinking, feeling, number-generating human beings &gt;'Heehee... yay...' &gt;wendy best girl"
"This is a simple but very enjoyable tactical action(ish) game. Taking the role of an officer of a standard unit, you decide the best way to arrange and utilize your forces in a series of skirmishes. Added to this plain setup is your own skill in determining limited placements in real time unit movement. This is something that would liven up any sort of strategy game rather than being rather cleverly disguised hex movements.  The art and design of the game is very pleasing, even to non-anime fans. There are anime tropes involved, but being a Japanese production of late that can't be helped. Even so, it's story is rather well thought out even with the more mystical elements in this rather subdued tale of kinda/sorta Dieselpunk action.  I reccomend everyone try this one, and hop that they can port the sequels easily... even though they are on the PSP."
"Absolutely fantastic game, The story A+ The characters A+ The atmosphere A+ The choice and handling of topic A+ The art work work A+ The gameplay A+  Game that surprised me the most in 2015 Highly recommend all to pick it up"
I bought this one on sale because is complete(dlc) compared to the cut content console version I alredy own...
It's Very good Tactical game and nice anime style
"it's a very good and unique game but with a lot of flaws.  PROS:  good/unique story, good gameplay,  good love story,  pleasing anime aesthetics. original japanese voice acting + dubbed voice acting available,  journal entries for characters places and weapons give the world depth, a lot of unique characters to put into your squad  CONS:  classes arent balanced, scouts are too useful and assaults cannot move anywhere game gives you less points than the number of characters you can move per turn tactically its not really that deep(lack of options) the scoring system is based on how many turns it takes you to win. making cool strategic plays meaningless all the characters are basically archetypes with not much depth lack of your regular squad members in cutscenes (if dead, chars could be replaced by generic militia in them) lack of information going into missions makes you go for pointless trial runs just so you know the map and enemy layout"
"OH MY GOD. If u chose the language to japanese, what they are saying is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT to the words shown in the subtitle. Although it ends the same but it just makes me feel weird since I can understand a bit of japanese.  Finished a few episodes, besides what I said, this game is nice actually although the graphics is a bit bad.  The Combat is pretty unique, unlike other rpg, it also required some strategy to win. The story is pretty nice by the way, if u like strategy rpg like civ or other games, u will also like this. I RECOMMEND THIS ONE AND BUY IT WHEN IT IS ON SALE"
Try to shoot an enemy. Character proclaims they're a pacifist. Character doesn't shoot. Enemy shoots back. Character dies.  it's gr8 m8 i r8 8/8  'Let's go get violent for Vegetables!' - Largo Potter 2008
A Very Well Done Strategy RPG Game in the Middle of a World War . Unique Characters and Memorable moments .   As Commander Welkin you are in charge of commanding Squad 7 each of amazing unique characters .  The idea of presenting the Story in a book is very interesting   alot of Customization for your Squads and Weapons to play around with and Skirmishes to gain money and experience  
"Great game, gives a challenge. Can spend weeks on a single level and still be interested.  Only downside? All the long cutscenes that can't be skipped, especially the trailer that plays every time you start the game. I'd like to be able to skip it and not watch it for the millionth time."
Spend 10 minutes watching the AI take 12 unskippable turns running in circles. On 13th and final turn takes the Main Camp - Game Over.  10/10 would rage again.
Pretty much Anime XCOM but with more story. Pretty fun
"Totally awesome, super worth it (the cpu cheats alittle) but it's super fun!..........................................but then i found out that there is an anime versoin of this game..............and now i'm losing my mind!!!! :D"
10/10
"If you are a big anime and turn based combat fan, buy this game. If you are neither still buy this game.  Pros:  +Great plot +Solid game mechanics +Both turn based and tps style gameplay +Did i say great plot? +Alicia Melchiott (waifu &lt;3)  Cons:  -Difficulty curve can be a bit harsh sometimes -Dated graphics (but art style looks awesome nontheless) -Some soldier classes feel a bit useless  5/7 has awesome rule 34"
very fun game this is my first time playing and im impressed very cool art style and very fun combat it's like fire emblem/ advance wars.
"I only got into this game because Japanese doujin artist, RAITA, basically kept telling me to while talking about how 'kawaii' some characters named Alicia Melchiott and Selvaria Bles are. They're alright, I guess, but I think the best character has to be Jann Walker. He must have accuracy of 110% and always ends up as the one to clear the objectives. I think Jann Walker is the real MVP of this game. Sorry, RAITA."
"This is my review after i finished the game, look at my hours. This game need around that number to finished with all of story and a few side stories + skirmishes.   My Rate : 7.5 of 10    Love Tactical Games?or maybe Puzzle ? This game is semi Action and Tactical, You control a Squad,And each turn you can move one by one character in action mode. Action mode is basicly move and order your character to shoot,bomb,heal,etc. And there are also a limit to do it in every turn.   Story :  Its good but not great. The story is really what you can think of. But its really fun to watch, especially if you love Anime.    Main Feature :  - You can buff and spam one unit in one turn to Finish one match (not anytime) But Worth it - Cool Canvas style graphic - You can think this game as puzzle you have many unit with many abilities, you have commands to buff, and you have limit action per turn. To get best (A) Rank you need to think how to finish one stage in least turn. Its exciting.    Other Feature :  - You can save in a battle, so if you think you messed up a bit you can load it.  - The Steam Achievement really makes you want to play it again after finished at least for a grinding lover like me.  - This game using Book for the story telling, so if you think you missed a bit you can re-watched it.   The Bad :  - No Fast Forward or skip Enemy Animation at their turn. So you need to watch them, it really boring if the enemy moves a lot. - Some abilities &amp; commands just to IMBA at the end of the game. It really makes the game easier a lot. - Sometimes the character didn't shoot at the right target and it waste your turn. It really makes me rage load.   Some Tips for play : (Imba buff)    Use Alicia + Awake Potential + Defense Boost + Double Movement Potential it will make you reach enemy base fast, and yeah i use it a lot and easy win lol xo       My Verdict :  If you really like anime, tactical, war, and shooting its worth it to buy it at full price. :) If not just wait for the discount to play it."
"Good Story, just like the Anime."
My tips for this game. Make Alicia charge every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and shoot them in face at blank range  (+).Not a third-person shooter but tactic (+).Animeish!! (+).Very good voice actor and art (+).Gameplay also addictive blasting dude on face at point black  (-).Delay between action quite long and you can even go to kitchen making coffe while waiting for enemy turn (-).The balancing in game is around 95% (why you no head shot marisa. you had one job) (-).Wish they add restart battle button in pause menu i had to shoot welkin tank to restart battle  Verdict: Like tactical game like XCOM? Like Anime and japan? this game should be a gold for you

You control a squad of cute girls to hunt down anime nazis.
"Awesome, unique gameplay, timeless visuals, outstanding soundtrack, lengthy campaign with replay value, tons of unlockables and beautiful design and presentation, moving story with relatable characters. Port really good, especially for a JRPG which tend ported like ♥♥♥. If you don't have a problem manga stereotypes, you owe yourself to try this, it's really one of the best games ever made and on pc, it shines at it's brightest."
"This is a great tactical RPG, combining classic tactical gameplay with 3rd person action. It also has a good story, and you get to choose your team from a huge cast of characters. If you like tactical RPGs, this game is a must-play."
I had a 12 year old kill an entire squad of not germans while a gay man blew up their tanks.   10/10
Great game. 9.5/10. Minus .5 for going on sale when I already owned the game.
Better than codename STEAM
"Valkyria Chronicles..... To be honest i have never played a game like this befor. Sure i like anime and i have read/played some visual novels. But this .... Valkyria Chronicles ... its so good, so amazing so great! Im just ... omg! There should be more games like this.   Anyways: If you like visual novel and or watching anime .... This is for you. If you like turn based 3rd person shooter .... This is for you.  Thus being in an anime, partaking in the story and feeling as if your one of the crew, is just great.  I highly recommend this game! I also recommend watching it in SUB not DUB (Go to settings and change audio to Japanese and add subs for those who dont understand Japanese)  Cons: - Minor sound lag. - Minor aim issue when u get close and personal (use ur brain and its fixed). - Crashing upon exit (lol). - Limited saves, aprox 20 saves (ive used all the saves but tbh its easy to work around). - At a moment you will recive a vehicle (not saying what type and its prety much your main vehicle) during the 'Command Mode' your vehicle will cost you 2 CP. Be warned when driving it at time you may loose your movments and not get anywhere. I recommend playing around with moving your vehicle so that you may understand how to move it efficiently. - If your a profectionist like me then you will spend alot of time reloading saves trying to get your sniper to do impossible shots, and making your troops move efficiently as possible.  Enjoy!  Side note: From the small research i did. I saw that it took over 8month to make and set the music for this game. From this i can make an educated guess that the game must have taken a year or more to make (only a guess i read some stuff from the wiki.). Thank you Sega for taking the time to make such a wonderfull game. :)"
"Completed this on the PS3, and I felt it was a good enough game to buy a second time here on Steam.  From what I've played of the PC port, it seems excellent, and it downsamples very well on my 970.  The main problem is not the iffy AI, or the low resolution of the pre-rendered cutscenes, but the fact that they have a Sgt. Melchiott, and no Blackadder crossover. Missed opportunity there, Sega. Bah, I say, Baaaaaah."
"Great story, great voice acting, and many different waifus to choose from"
"Well worth a buy, hopefully the 2nd on somehow gets a port"
This game was the farthest thing from what I like in games. Or so I thought. Bored in Alaska with my mega ganing PC I had run out of games to play. This game was recommended to by a friend for being like XCOM which I love. This game was amazing from start to end. I pray to sweet baby jesus they bring the later games of Valkyria Chronicles to PC. If you are into turn based games that invlove shooting people in their faces then buy this thing and cry like I did when it was over.
"Love this game's art style and story. Definitely worth the money and time to play it.  I don't have a PSP, so I really hope VC2 and VC3 can be released as PC version soon!"
"This is a great addition, to your gaming libary!"
"A mix of Xcom , Fire Emblem and Advance wars......so its good !!  9/10"
"Honestly one of the best game I have played in a long time. The story isn't anything ground breaking but is enough to keep you interested. But the gameplay is the kicker. A blend of RTS, third person shooter and RPG sounds like a mess but blend into a tactical creamy goodness."
Why don't you already have this?
"Dialogue is cheesier than a triple cheese stuffed crust pizza with extra mozzarella, but the turn-based combat system more than makes up for it. Fun game."

Went all african warlord on this game and sent my militia squad consisting solely of under aged children to war against a superior military force consisting of highly train soldiers. 10.9/10 would recommend
I enlisted and became an officer in one day.  Surrounded by beautiful anime women.   Rosie is bae &lt;3   Please play.  
How can my little shocktrooper possibly be this cute?
Its like Band of Brothers with waifus. Band of Waifus.  9/10 would waifu again.
"Welp, i played this game for straight 9 hours whitout stopping and i must say it is a true beauty. You don't get to see such high quality games much these days..."
"I absolutely ADORE this game! It is definitely, without a doubt, one of my favorite games. I just love the art style, the soundtrack, the gameplay, the characters, the story, EVERYTHING! The story made me both laugh and cry and I was drawn into it from the get-go (although I could have lived without that romantic sub-plot). I still get back to this game at times and still love every minute of it.   However, I believe that the ranking system is completely broken and I wish it had gone in another direction. It is only based on how many rounds you complete the mission on, which means that you can just basically rush it to the finish line with one character, not kill a single enemy, and get an A-rank. To me, that’s just mind-boggling, because why design such an incredibly satisfying combat system with so many different mechanics which make way for so many different dynamics? I mean, when I first discovered that I could kill two or three enemies at once by either placing a bomb between them or carefully positioning my stormtrooper in a way that the missing shots still would hit another enemy behind, I felt like a BADASS. I really took time planning my route, placing my troops on the field and making sure I kill all enemies on as few rounds as possible. For me, it was like playing an intense game of chess.   Many times I would have completely swept the field clean of enemies and completed the mission on less than 3 rounds. I would lean back proudly in my chair after the match and think that there is no way I could get anything other than an A-rank and later see a B or C-rank pop up on my screen. It was so frustrating that I was not rewarded for actually making most out of the combat system and being really skilled at it. All I needed to do was to pick a scout and run to the finish line to get an A-rank. WHY?!?! It is like playing a game of chess with the main goal being to reach the other side as quickly as possible. So you could just pick a chess piece and make sure it reaches the side unharmed, but you would totally miss the whole strategic gameplay aspect which is the essence of chess and what made chess so popular.   The fact that they have a trait on a character that will most of the times, if activated on the field, chose not to shoot an enemy because she a pacifist is just beyond me. It was extremely annoying and it did not suit my play style so I would most of the times just reload my last save until she actually shoots the enemy I want.   It is clear that this game would like to show another side of war that is not centered on killing every troop out there, which I would accept if the gameplay wasn’t so freaking good and if there were actually different secret routes you could take to reach the finish line quickly.   Even if the ranking system is one major issue I have with the game, Valkyria Chronicles still is one of my favorite games and very dear to me. Hopefully we will see a sequel sometime soon!"
"I've completed the game on the PS3, as well as the 2nd game on the PSP. Got to the 3rd from last chapter on Steam, so guess I'll go ahead and give my feedback. =)  Graphics: 9.5/10  Very unique animation. Looks like everything was hand drawn and painted. Probably one of, if not the, most gorgeous styles I've ever seen. The animations as well are very well done, almost like a full on anime (which the series has). Would almost recommend the game on the graphics alone.  Gameplay: 9/10  I loved the gameplay. It gave me the feeling of a Visual Novel for the side dish, and a strategic role playing shooter for the main dish. It was very well planned out and the tactical combat got very intense at some points. This is the second thing that would make me gurrantee recommendations to others. Most, if not all, SRPG lovers will adore this game, me being one of them.  Characters: 10/10  The best part of the whole game. The characters were absolutely amazing. You will be introduced to only three at first, but will increase drastically throughout the story. All the main characters are highly memorable, and even all the side-characters have their own story in the game that you can unlock. Im'ma stop myself before I spoil, but know that this is the main reason I would recommend this series to people.   Story 9.5/10  Just like with the graphics, I was this close (|-|) to recommending the game based on the beggining of the story alone. The story is absolutely amazing, getting detailed from beggining to end. Heck, there was a anime made for the series due to how amazing it was. The only reason, I mean the only reason, I didn't put 10/10 for this series is due to the fact I have seen a select few flaws here and there. If not for those minor flaws, it would be a 10. Then again, most people wouldn't even notice them if they didn't play the game multiple times. XD  Over-All: 9.5/10  I would most definately recommend this to anyone who loves a great story, SRPG, beatuiful graphics, or all of these. Valkyria Chronicles is a amazing game whom's disc I won't be getting rid of for a long time to come.  Nominated for the 'Not mentioned' reward as a 'Great Graphic style' nominee.=)"
+Incredible JRPG similar to fire emblem without tiles. +Nice story. +Excellent OST. +Awesome anime art style. +A lot of units with a great potentials system. +Includes typical anime beach episode.  -AI is horrible sometimes leading to a lack in difficulty  Personal enjoyment: 9/10 .
"Very good, enjoyable and fun game. Great sotry and gameplay. Really cool and unique graphics. If you like turn based strategy with RPG elements then dont miss out this jewel with unique gameplay. For the best experience I would recommend using a controller. And hey there is an anime that you should totally watch. I liked the Japanese voices more, but that is just my personal opinion. For me one of the best games ever worth the full price. (like 40h of gameplay for such a cheap price)."
"It got me as the PS3 version did. Roundbased / realtime tactical mix at it's best with nice painted graphics, music and characters that are worth to remember. The whole progress of the game steps forward as reading chapters in a book. At battles you move your players for a short time (enemy shot back while you do) until your command points are used - then the enemy strikes back. Compared to the console version the videos might look a bit low-res (but still ok) on your full-hd screen while battles even work in high resolutions and it's well playable with controller or mouse/keyboard. I hope even the PSP version from VC2 would be ported and for sure some VC3 in future :)"
"just a short review: pretty much the best game i have played in 2014, with a great story that kept me on edge in places and great gameplay. only problems i had was with the port, fiddley menu controlls and awkward tank driving. all in all 9/10 a must play in my opinion."
"8.1/10 A nice mixup between battelfield and turn based strategy type games.  The story is set in a WOII like setting but in an anime fantasy world. The evil Imperial forces storm into your Shire a like country Gallia to mine the valuable resource ragnite. You, Welkin, a young boy while doing research in nature meet with a young girl Alicia. A few moments later the Imperial forces storm in your village and you have to defend it. Together with Alicia you decide to join the army and fight for Gallia!  The story itself is very predictable, but the gameplay has a nice twist if you are willing to take the time. You play like an rts alike game. You see the icons of all your units and you can order high level commands. But when selecting a unit, you switch to third person and you have to do the action yourself. This is a nice twist on the ordinary gameplay from battelfield, but it can be very anoying due some wonky ingame mechanics. So if you want to do something quick or easily, forget it, that won't work.  The personages are written pretty good they have their own distinct characteristics which makes every team member feel real. When a teammate dies you really feel bad since it was your choice and your fault that he/she died. If a teammate dies they will be dead for the rest of the game. So the lives of your teammembers really are at stake. Unless you lose the battle overall, which means you have to replay the last one or two hours of battling.   Overal Valkyria Chronicles is a decent game about war stories from you and your teammates but the story remains very predictable.  + Gameplay you don't see often it feels fresh, Nice anime graphics style, Good level design, Okay story - Very anoying gameplay hickups, wonky controls, some ingame bugs, pretty big death penalty, not that much replay value  If you like the gameplay idea, you should try it out. But since it is a 50 hour game, I don't expect many will see the end due to the predictable story and wonky gameplay."
+ like Fire Emblem crossed with Advance Wars + turn-based goodness + waifu simulator + androgynous male lead  - only 5 classes :(  but honestly it's pretty much everything i want out of a JRPG/10
"Impulse buy even tho I have it on PS3 already lol. It's alot more convient to play on PC anyway.   Love this game, I'm a big fan of SRPGs like this, Shining Force, Fire Emblem, Advanced Wars and Langrisser. The dialog is a little hammy but the story is solid. The gameplay is what makes it shines love the combination of real time and turnbased combat. I hope they make a true sequel. Also hope Sega keeps bringing over it's Japanese console games....I need some Yakuza in my steam life. haha"
Great game....   **** you chapter 11 ;_;
"Anime tank game with more cutscenes than a Metal Gear Solid game.  It's good, the gameplay is nice, it looks pretty and is an amazingly done port."
Fantastic game. Take it slow and enjoy. I'll play through it again.
"So: '(…)You play as the squad commander of the Squad 7 from a small neutral country placed between the interest of 2 empires in a fictionalized Europe-esque continent -aptly named Europa. As the game goes by you have the chance to select who of of the possible 40+ charcters you want on your platoon, from wihich you have to pick who will actualy fight. Each character has its perks, like alergies or being a lone wolf. Also each character likes being around certain other characters, so you might as well pick someone to go to battle just so the one that is in love with him gets a bonus. You end up shipping charatcers becaause of this so you actually care abou them. It's really good.'   I can't believe this si the way I text my friends... kill me..."
"Reasons to buy this game: Easy to learn, and fun gameplay Tanks everywhere Ramona Linton  Reasons to not buy this game:"
Best ever anime game . Make me a new ideal with Anime Game
"Great, innovative gameplay that mixes elements of turn-based strategy and 3rd person real time combat. The timeless art style gives way to a well-told story that is charming and engaging throughout.  Definitely a must-play."
"Possibly the only reason I regretted not getting a PS3 but thanks to Steam thats no longer a problem. This game is great so if i had to sum it up in a few words think WWII setting, anime visuals, and X-COM style combat."

"Valkyria Chronicles is a RPG that tells the story of a guy and his group of friends, who find an old tank group up to fight against an invading super power. The game is placed roughly in the 1930's and has about the same look and feel as the events that took place during the start of World War 2. There are a bit of fantasy elements as well but not to the degree of certain JRPG's.   Valkyria Chronicles is the single best game I have ever played that is not an fps. This game is easily one of the most beautiful games I have ever had the pleasure of experiancing. The story and the art are 10/10. The strategic manoeuvring of units combined with turn based RPG gameplay, all layered on top of the moment to moment action afforded by real-time controls as players command each squad member and tank in battle. Reminicent of Xcom but with third person over the shoulder and actual aiming. It feels familar but is still unique and approachable.  This game is one of the sleeper hits on the ps3. Not many people know of it do to little marketing at the time, but it is one of the single highest rated games on that system according to both players and game reviewers.  This was ported over to pc from the ps3. It should run really well, even for people playing on toasters. You can play using a controller, or mouse and keyboard. Menus there is no mouse support, must use a keyboard. In game, camera control and aiming has good mouse support and uses WASD to move your character."
10 out of 10. Great story.
"Valkyria chronicles is a bit like XCOM, but with more direct action. Also it is about magical girls duking it out for fantasy switzerland during (Fantasy!) World War II. So the story and dialogue leave a bit to be desired, though they do have their moments.  The other big difference from other turn based tactics games is the unit control. Instead of just directing troops to move and shoot, you take control of them like a lite third person shooter. You move to where you want to go, select an enemy to empty your clip into, then get the chance to move again. Additionally you can spend your actions each turn to use various buffs and abilities as the commander. Another unique touch is that every one of your soldiers has a unique model and backstory, with abilities that reflect their personalities. The writing, again, is not fantastic, but you should be able to find a few characters you like to latch onto  The port was well done. my only issue is that the menus in the game cannot be navigated by mouse. The keyboard controls work well, but it is a bit unexpected. In combat the controls feature full mouse support and work wonderfully. Graphically the game has a great style that stands out and works well, even at higher resolutions. It is all very anime, but the watercolor theme adds a nice touch. The port supports any 16:9 resolution (Leterboxes if you have 16:10 as I do.) and runs very smoothly. The perfomance is far better than I have seen on other last gen PC ports, its really rather impressive."
"A modern turn based JRPG masterpiece. Plays like a cross between X-COM and a light 3rd person shooter. Fun, playful story, surprisingly engaging characters, great music and visual style. Highly recommended."
"Valkyria Chronicles is the perfect game for anybody with a love of the Fire Emblem series, or hated XCOM's silly enemy movement mechanic. Of particular note is the final arena. The developers did a phenomenal job of recreating the pain of living through World War 2 by creating the most arduous, drawn out battle mechanic for an enemy I've ever seen.  If you leave that part out, the game itself offers an entertaining, likeable characters that grow as the story progresses and superb game mechanics. 10/10 the ani-nazis stole my tank."
"Really enjoyed this one. Mostly turn-based with a little splash of real-time-ish components: when you activate a unit, you swap to a 3rd person over the shoulder. Movement is AP based, not time-limited, but units will fire in real-time at a unit that is in movement mode (applies for your units shooting at moving enemy units as well) so you still want to be mindful of cover while you move.  Don't worry if you're not a FPS champ, once you switch to aim mode, enemy units stop getting that free suppresive fire, so you may calmly aim at your leisure (just be quick to hit the 'aim' button when you're done moving, if you happen to be getting shot at there)."
good to play but like a sequel
"This is a game i seriously regret not purchasing sooner. Fresh exciting game with fun combat with a excellent story mode that has events, charachter interaction and customisable units. As much fun and powerful stuff the game gives you the diffictulty is still there as well so be ready for a challenge. Game is a port but they have done it very well other then the odd crash i havent had any issues."
"Anyone who has enjoyed a turn-based RPG, a tactical shooter like X-COM, or just a fun story should absolutely treat themselves to Valkyria Chronicles. The core gameplay is a hybrid turn-based shooter but it gives you the freedom to explore different routes and strategies. The story and characters are presented in a wonderful water-color/anime art style embedded in an old fashion story book. Seriously, this game's got everything: action, strategy, and God damn, even a bit of romance. You should stop reading reviews and just buy the thing!"
"One of the best Turn-Based RPGs of all time. Stylish graphics, amazing soundtrack, addictive gameplay and a good story. There you go: one of the best games of all time."
"A tale of war, bigotry, friendship, and the human condition Valkyria Chronicles manages to combine a captivating story with a unique combat system! 9/10 View the full review:  http://techraptor.net/content/valkyria-chronicles-great-war "
It's possible to beat most missions in 2-3 turns with your super-waifus  10/10
EVERYONE should buy this game! You'd be crazy not to! 10/10
"This is not only a very good tactical RPG , but has a great story as well.  The Tactical elements (with mission ranking from S down to Fail) keep you coming back for more, not only to win the battles but win them in the best way possible. There are also nice elements within the RPG on building your squad up (certain members play better with others ... adding some spice to mission selections) as well you can upgrade your tanks with various abilities.  The story is centre to the game - and has many turns and twists. well worth the time you invest.  All in all this is a superb tactical J-RPG, and if you have never played JRPG's - this would be a super first start.  The Game is well worth the money (this is my 2nd play through ... previously completing it on the PS3).  I definitely recommend this game."
Want to see what the game looks like on PC? Check out my video!  https://youtu.be/DtL9mmCP4vw 
"If you want to play an anime, this is the game for you."
A really chalenging rpg/stratigy game I say 10/10.
"If you haven't tried this game yet, drop whatever you're doing, and buy it immidiately. It's pure gold, and makes me really sad that most games like this will stay console exclusives. So buy it, show SEGA that we love it and want more."
Great game with a great story.
I played once on the PSP long time ago. Saw this on sales. Add in cart without any hesitation! Nice game! Fun to play!!!!!
Is amazing how the Game is still run for the pass 7 years and Steam made it like was still Brand new    10/10
"Amazing game. The music is top quality and the voice acting is pretty good. I've played this game on PS3 and the PC port is pretty good, but there are a couple of problems.   On chapter 15, several times my soldiers would get stuck, walking down stairs and ending up below the map. As it happens, you don't have to go up the stairs to beat the chapter, and it is possible to walk them back up in the darkness, it's still irratating.  Also, tank driving is very cumbersome. However overall, good gameplay, good story, and ok replayability. The addition of various difficulties for the levels helps, but can get a bit dry, since there are a limited number of maps. "
I had a great time getting really in depth with this game at it does a marvelous job of pulling you into its wonderfully crafted world.
Nice little alternative history strategy game. Animu +1
Great port! One of the best RPG's of all time. Beautiful artwork and engaging play style.
Turn-Based Strategy Shooter RPG anime game! awesomeee :O  Can be pretty challenging and unfortunately there's a problem controlling the tank when using keyboard + mouse (main issue is with the mouse) so if not using a controller try to control the tank using the keyboard somehow with least mouse interaction as it can waste alot of action points.
"10/10 Buy even at regular price. On sale? Definitely buy.   I'll make this short and sweet.  Excellent story. Balanced Combat/Units VERY easy to pick up, but takes time to master Do you like Fire Emblem? You will love this game. Skirmish missions outside main campaign let you level up soldiers if you wish. Upgrade weapons/killing named enemy heroes for weapon drops you can equip Beating certain missions and/or getting certain ranks will unlock special weapons You can choose unit combinations for most missions. (more than one strategy for victory) You can replay the campaign with your same soldiers/weapons after first playthrough. Not really into Japanese/anime style? Don't let that stop you playing this game.   Also, anyone who ever played Skies of Arcadia on the Dreamcast or GameCube will recognize 2 playable characters and a certain medic. "
This is a fun game.  This game is fun.
"Nice its mixing RPG theme with tactical and some shooting game good variety and good enchancement the story is less interesting, but still good anyhow"
"An interesting combination of turn based strategy and third person shooter. It's a definite play for any fans of games such as Fire Emblem or Advance Wars with each story map having a different objective and unique idea behind it the game pushes you to try different strategies continuously. The story is an interesting fictional take on Europe during the period of World War 1 and World War 2 as you play as the militia for a small, independent, neutral nation under invasion from the expansionist empire. It deals with some rather heavy themes, getting the closest I think any game ever has to talking about the holocaust in any significant manner. It tugs at your heart strings at times and the battles begin to truly ramp up and against your odds.  More of my thoughts here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt6GrVxyP4s "
"Bought this game during the Winter Sale, but it's definitely worth full price! A truly great video game experience, and my favorite in recent gaming history. Spoiler-free review for the potential buyer; inspired by my recent completion of the main story for the first time, I feel it necessary to gush out my first impressions.    Overall: 9/10"
"Turn based military RPG. I never seen a RPG game like this. I was curious, tried out this game. And.. wow, it was actually fun. People tend to complain about voice acting on Japanese games, but voice acting was nicely done. One of the best voice acting on Japanese games. I'd have believed if it was actually made by US game company lol. The game gets quite easier as time progress, but it wasnt so easy, or hard. I think game balance was done nicely too. Downside is, this game might get boring because there's a lot of walking, and slow tanks.. game is slow. And some, weird story plot, tho story was good enough. I'd say it's worth the money. I had fun playing this game. Get this game."
"After playing this game for a while I've totally fallen in love with it. I got into the anime and the manga after buying this and I recommend both. I'll tell you what sold me, I was looking for a replacement for Fire Emblem Awakening and I found it. You basically get a team of anime character troupes and send them into battle. It's not candy coated either I once had one of my Snipers blown out of a tower by a enemy tank. It kinda sucks when that happens to a sterotypical anime girl.   Like Fire Emblem each character has a set of traits that make them unique. They can have allergies that make them weaker on certain battlefield types or they have really good night time vision, etc. In addition they also pair with other soldiers for added benifits.   For those of us who really enjoy getting into the game's 'universe' there is a extensive character bio and glossary where you can educate yourself on the country your fighting for and the men and women you fighting alongside.  I highy recommend this game, thanks for reading.  "
Awesome game. Amazing art style. Great story.
"I bought this on PS3 but never really played it due to the absurd load times of the PS3.  This PC port has little to no load time and the CANVAS engine has held up over the years and looks great on PC. I like having the Japanese voices, but the english subtitles could have been better.  Overall a great PC port for a game that many might have skipped over on PS3."
"One of the best games I've played on the PS3 now available on the PC that I've died and went to hevean. Sure, only 12.7 hours into it right now since I play a few chapters after work and before going to bed (I don't dare play before work because I would be clocking in 2+ hours late if I even show up).  The graphics is great even if they do use the same ones from the PS3 version.  The story is great, it has nice feels to it. It's, just, so, beatiful... So much so that I got my supervisor playing it."
"I saw the anime way back and really liked it, good story and characters. And then I came across this in Steam. The anime and this game harmonizes with each other beautifully, soft and vibrant water-color, great in-game music and awesome characters (familiar faces and new ones too) &amp; backstory, totally works hand-in-hand with the anime. Did I mention the fantastic voice actors? Looks pretty and all but it's challenging as well (MASSIVE ENEMY TANKS TAKE 30+ MINUTES TO DESTROY). Overall a great game to play! &lt;3  "
Anime like game + epic strategy = epic game. This game can be hard at times (which is a good thing) and I really think anyone should consider getting this game if they like strategic games.
I had no idea what I was getting in to when I started this up. Strategic turn based infantry combat that's great fun.
Valkyria Chronicles is a great turn based RPG with grid based strategy movements. The game will appeal to anyone who enjoys WW2 tank battles and likes to plan strategic moves to overtake the enemy forces throughout the story of the game. Key characters are worth protecting to enjoy their story lines and one liners throughout the game. With full controller support this game will be exciting to play on devices capable of game streaming like the shield.
"A competent port of one of the best games in recent memory. The menu could use mouse support and it's too bad the cutscenes weren't higher quality, but they're very minor complaints. Easily one of my favorite games."
"I remember when the anime came out for this and I really enjoyed it. I didn't realize that it was actually based on a video game and saw that it was released for PS3. I always wanted to play it, but since I never owned a PS3, never had the chance too. Now that it released on Steam, I instantly pre-ordered it and am now stuck on playing it. I love the artwork and how the story is told into chapters like a storybook and the elements in leveling up your units and purchasing upgrades for your weapons and tank. Coming from a PS3 console port, this is definitely done well for doing so. I'm not a big SRPG type of player, but this is a big exception in my book. Love the elements involved. If you enjoy turn based strategy with RPG elements, this is the came for you. You'll not be disappointed!"
It is a perfect turn-based strategy !
"Valkyria Chronicles was the reason I bought my PS3, After seeing the gameplay and how beautiful and unique the game looked I just had to buy the game and I was floored. It has since become one of my all time favorite games and one that I've gone back and replayed many many times. And as soon as I heard that this was being released on steam I was so excited that I had an excuse to support this game and play it again. And after playing through the first few chapters on the Steam version, I am not Disapointed at all. The game runs great, even on my poor laptop, the graphics look nice and updated (though I might be wrong about this). But the Bottom line is you shouldn't miss out on a Fantastic game like this. And hopefully with the support that this port gives towards the VC Series, we might be able to see the other 2 Valkyria Chronicles games re-updated and ported to Steam (Maybe with an Online features :3) If you are a fan of Turn Based Tactics games, this is a must have."
Salinas destroyed a tank with an assault rifle. 11/10 SENSHA MOE!
"Having put many hours into the PS3 version and all its DLC I feel it is worth taking the time to review the PC port of this game.  It is an amazing game that everyone who enjoys strategy games should try. The game is a turn-based srategy game but becomes a real-time game as you move your units - you have a limited number of actions each turn but each action allows you to move your unit around the game map in real-time, avoiding coming under fire, positioning them and attacking. It really makes you use your turns strategically but also think on how to move and position your units. There is also extra depth i nthe form of equipable weapons, upgrades, and personal abillties.  The story is pretty cool too, a unique take on warfare that blends WW2 with magic and mysticism. It covers the woes and tradgey of warfare, persecusion and more. It is really good for a strategy game, making it more like an S-RPG than anything else. The characters all hold their own and even the non-story related characters (most of your playable units) have thier own distinct appearances and personailties, making them likeable (or not, in some cases :P)  The art style looks gorgeous, featuring anime-like visuals presented in a unique water-colour handdrawn style that makes the game stand out from the crowd. It was a breakthrough when it first came out on the PS3 in 2008 and still looks great now.  As far of the PC port of this game does it is pretty ace - you have full control over graphic settings which helps boost this game from its 720p/30fps roots on PS3 into whatever you are capable of running. The game has both controler and keybopard support but I only have tried out a controller so far as that is what I am used to from the PS3 version. The only downside with the PC port is that most of the cutscenes are lcoked at 720p/30fps because they are pre-rendered clips, not running in-game real-time - nothing major.  Long story short - buy this game! It's a great turn-based/real-time strategy hybrid with a solid story that looks amazing."
"All right now we're talking!  Valkyria Chronicles is the epitome of 'under the radar' games in the ps3 era. A lot of people overlooked this gem and I admit I was close to doing so as well until I saw a video review shortly before its release on PS3. The art style was great and the gameplay instantly reminded me of classic X-COM. The added bonus of having a class system with scouts, assault, lancer (heavy), engineer, and sniper made it even deeper and more strategy-involved.    Its not a strict turn based system like X-COM, more like a hybrid where if the attacking enemy walks within sight and range of a defender the defender will open fire automatically...usually with devestating results unless you find cover fast or take that defender out. Between battles you have the opportunity to upgrade weapons and armor, as well as leveling up your classes. Once you get a class to lvl 10 it usually becomes some sort of specialized unit capable of more damage and able to take more punishment.    The missions are set up in a chapter format, and around chapter 3 various things start to unlock. If you ever feel under-powered you can go to various skirmishes to get experience and cash. There are crazy boss battles and even regular skirmishes that require quite a bit of thinking to pull off with out killing any of your squad. By the time you make it to chapter 10 its full on war and the game will punish you if you try to rambo through it.    This game is a mostly flawless port from the PS3. The load/save times are instantaneous, which is an incredible improvement over its console counterpart. However the menu system is a bit odd if you're using mouse and keyboard. It could've been more mouse pointer friendly, its still relavtively easy to navigate but it could've been easier. The increased resolution and framerate is always a plus. Thanks PC!   The game is as fun and challenging on PC as it was when I put dozens of hours into it on PS3 six years ago. At $20, its a great value for the amount of time this classic SRPG will give you. Highly recommended!"
Valkyria Chronicles™ is the best and most fantastic anime-like RPG game I've ever played. The graphics are almost likely drawn by hand. The graphics and arts are all beautiful. The story is a combined dramatic and heartwarming story about war and love that bloomed in war. The music is also very heartwarming and a perfect match for the story because it is also very dramatic. I rated Valkyria Chronicles™ as a MASTERPIECE. My score is 10 of 10. I recommend this game.
The moment I saw Valkyria Chronicles advertised on Steam I've just fallen in love. This game has everything a great game needs to have:  - Great story that u will be sucked into - Numerous well developed characters - Great music and dubbing - It's challenging!! - Emotional  The only downside are the mission briefings that could be a bit more detailed.  All in all I have to say that it's the best game I played recently and one of the best I played in lifetime! SEGA.. Thank You!! :D
Great game. Need I say more?
"Would I recommend this game? Abso-♥♥♥♥ing-lutely. I've wanted this game since its console release, but could never get my hands on a copy. I gotta hand it to Sega, they really came through with this port. Other game companies should take note on how it's done. The tank controles when using a keyboard and mouse are a bit janky, but it's not too big of an issue. Amaing story, and fantastic gameplay."
Bought for 20 bucks. Not too shabby.
" An epic game.  I absolutely loved it. Every Second. That said, I already knew most of the story from the anime beforehand. But that did'nt matter. It was a great joy to play the game nevertheless. Maybe even more, because I met all the characters that I knew from the anime again. And there are little differences.  There's so much detail and love in this game. It's amazing. And it was never boring :) I can absolutely recommend it."
"This is hands down the best RPG I've ever played. More so... the best JRPG I've played. I have never heard of this game before. I had ever played a game like this before. It has blown all my expectations and went above it.  This game gives you feels, happiness, sadness - punches you around and then you love it again.  This game will make you want to go to a bakery in real life. You will go to a bakery --- and you will like the bread. You will like it so much you will love the baker. But in all seriousness... get this game for a rollercoaster you haven't had before.  PS: Watch the credits and post credits."
"Turn based strategy game WITH LINE OF SIGHT INDICATION! GAME OF THE YEAR EVERY YEAR  Quality game with some nuances compared to other turn based strategy games like xcom, but once acclimated you will be rolling. The game takes a few missions to open up."
"Good game, good port, good price.  Nuff said!"
"I never do recommend games in a specific way, and I won't in this case. Except if you like JRPGs. Then I'm telling you to stop yourself from not trying this beautiful, precious game. If only, for it's beauty. But there's more... strategy, story, beloved characters; so yeah, STOP! Also, stop reading too, you're wasting download time. Bye, hope my 'review' serves you well."
"Very well done game with great story. This game has heart, art and a well thought out tactical game to compliment the story."
"Great game, fun as ♥♥♥♥"
"Awesome game, don't know what much to say but I had high expectations of this game and every time I would be surprised by something new from the game. 9/10"
"Its a fun solo game that would be better with multiplayer but oh well...Just note this is fire emblem hit percentages so even though you look like you will hit you will most likely miss, just so you keep that in mind  Players lost in game wont come back either, though you have 5 turns to get to them to save them OR beat the level before 5 turns. if the enemy touches the downed person they are lost for good as well."
"Good game, though I wish there was less grinding needed and/or some notification as to level requirements for certain missions. Though I guess that is what guides are for."
"This game is easily one of my favorite Strategy RPG's as of the time of posting. The graphics are pleasing, good variety of characters, and over 30+ hours of content. The beginning of the game eases new players into the game's mechanics and SRPG Vets will find plenty of challenge. Also, for the weebs, you can change the characters voices in cutscenes from English to Japanese."
Someone named 'Kevin' actually carried me to victory.  11/10
great game great story great graphics 10/10 nothing to complain about just one little thing driving a tank can be annoying sometimes but its no big deal
One of the most engaging and unique stategy games i've ever played.
"Hands down, a fun, stylistic entertaining game, from start to finish.  Wonderful artwork, impressive english va.  I would pay real money to see a 4th version of this game come out, or even an mmo keeping the same stylistic graphic choices they employed for this series. The developers should be damn proud."
"This game will make you smile. Will make you sad, will make you angry.  If you like some of the typical Japan games features, you don't need this review. You already have Valkyria Chronicles or you are just wainting for some sale on it.  If you arre new to this type of games, then by all means buy and play it! You won't be sorry. Beside playing i strongly encurage to watch Valkyria Chronicles animated series by Yamamoto Yasutaka. Just watch out for spoilers by watching all episodes before finishing the game ;) Also play with subtitles instead of dubbing, way more cool ;)  In my book this game is 9/10. Missing one point due to port technical stuff. Basicly cutscenes are reendered in 720p as on console."
Fun mix of Tactics and Third Person Shooter. Graphics glitches need fixed.
"Did cry, many goods. not enough stingers though."
I like the battle mechanics of the game. Story is great too.
i blew up a tank with assault rifles..... 5/5
This game is good.
"Valkria Chronicles is a game like no other. It successfully combines a historical fantasy setting with a deep strategic gameplay mechanic that while being multi-layered, is still easily accessible.  The storyline is familiar (due to the obvious parallels to WWII) but still original and intensely rewarding.  This was one of my favorite games on PS3 and the PC version is just as good and a fantastic bargain. Though the graphics don't really benefit from higher resolution they are still fantastic in style and presentation."
Incredibly entertaining strategy game that I've beaten several times on the PS3 and having the opportunity to play an upscaled version on PC is a joy. Great combat scenarios with endearing characters in a fairly solid war drama that is worth the price for any lover of video game out there.
Frie Emblem + Final Fantasy + WWI / WWII = Valkyria Chronicles    10/10
"I played this back in 2008 I believe, on ps3. I never got to finish the game so I was thrilled to see it on pc. Without going on forever in detail, I'd say its worth the purchase, especially if your in to 'tactical' combat. Charming characters and fun strategic elements mixed with anime style graphics make for an enjoyable experience.     14/ 3 thumbs up"
"I cannot believe I have not found this gem before. It is one of the best genre mashup games I have played. The story is compelling, the characters are dynamic within the narrative and on the battlefield. Some of the most expansive RPG elements for a story based strategy game."
That moment when you're an hour into a battle and a lancer pops up behind your tank.  10/10 would RQ again.
"Very enjoyable game, hope the sequels get ported as well."
"Just as good as on PS3, without half-hour loading times."
"Good port of a fantastic game. If you're even mildly interested in tactical RPGs, strong wartime stories, or just unconventional graphics engines, and you haven't played Valkyria Chronicles, just buy it now.  Be sure to save before battles."
This game was awesome when I played it on the PS3. And now it's even better now that it's on PC. It's a game everyone calling themselves strategy gaming fans must experience.   
10/10  the first game that make feel sad  if i can change the story...
"For an older game this is excellent. I do prefer controller and as such am not having difficulty as some of the keyboard/mice players seem to have reviewed. It is not an instant gratification game or a game with leading edge use of technology. The port work seems to be fairly well done and i am not noticing sound/graphic issues, unreasonably laggy performance, or lack of setting options.  This game focuses very heavily on storyline, unique art animation vs relaistic graphics, and use of strategy.  While some missions and most skirmishes can be done quickly, some missions may take some players over an hour and can make the game seem slow moving. I emphasize again, this is a game for patient people."
A 3rd person RPG/Strategy game with minor FPS elements topped off with an Anime World War 2 theme and concentration camps. What's not to love? It's beautiful for a port. Haven't experienced any bugs at all.
"Being a longtime fan of both strategy games and first person shooters this game is a refreshing new take combining both of them. Besides having one of the most solid gameplays rivialing any of the other mainstream strategy games i've played, it is furthermore enhanced 10 fold by the wonderful story it portrays. That being said you are missing out if you do not play this game, however there is is a major drawback to this game which is that 'WARNNING' it will absorb 20+ hours of your life from start to finish due to the addictive need to know what happens next."
"I wanted to finish the game completely before making a review, I have never touched a JRPG game in my life and I likely wasn't ever going to until I had saw Valkyria Chronicles during the Steam Summer Sale, after watching the trailer on the store page it had caught my intrest with it's intresting watercolour artstyle and world war setting, a glance at the reviews showed a large ammount of positve reviews praising it's story and gameplay, so I decided to jump out of my comfort zone and give it an honest try.  That said, Valkyria Chronicles takes place in a fictional World War 2, two great powers are fighting for control for the land of Europa, the western Federation and the eastern Empire and they are locked in what seems to be a never ending conflict. The neutral land of Gallia finds itself undersiege by the Empire for it's rich minerals known as Ragnite - a rare and ever fading resource known for it's all general purposes -, as protagonist Welkin Gunther and side protagonist Alicia Melchiott, it falls to you to defend Gallia from the Empire and drive them out of your homeland.  There is  ALOT  of plot and narrative in this game, so if you're not a fan of story driven games, then this is not for you, as between each story mission there will be at least 4 to 7 cutscenes advancing character developement and game setting. The story is told through a book called 'On the Gallian Front' which acts as a central menu to cutscenes, missions, headquaters which is where you do your upgrades and research as well as additional information on the world around you.  Of course the game is not all plot and cinematics, there is an actual game here to play, Valkyria Chronicles is rather a turn-based action hybrid game, Like in XCOM you have your units laid out on the map before you, but instead of clicking on them and telling them where to go and fire, you manually control each of their movements in a third person action camera, letting you move and aim freely as you want, so long as you don't exhausted your Action Points, those being represented in a small bar at the bottom of your screen, if you run out of AP, you can't move and will have to end your units turn, nothing is to stop you from moving that same unit again, but it will cost you another command point and will also have reduced AP. I didn't think the hybrid would work to well, but it kind of does, it lets you feel more involved if anything, rather than just watching AI fire back and fourth after giving orders, which is another thing I need to mention.  Orders are special commands that Welkin can issue his team that are unlocked very early in the game, some of these are increases in damage, resistance and other special effects that can help you in your current mission, never ever shun them as these can be huge difference makers in thier own right, however I will openly say that playtesting these Orders wasn't done very well, I won't explain in detail, but let me just say that a lot of missions can potentionally be finished in thier very first turns of the level using a scout (most likely Alicia because she is actually OP) and a combination of certain orders.  But like most JRPGs, the story is why most people would buy a game like this, so what did I think of it? I'm a fan of World War 2-esque settings and it was an intresting take on SEGAs part, I can tell that they tried to approach the game with alot of care and maturity, even going as far to include the equivilent of concentration camps, murder and slavery, not the kind of settings I expected from a company like Sega, but it's good to see that they did branch out of thier safety zones and into something more realistic. They also did a great job of giving the game a likable main cast of characters who all have some personality behind them, making each one stand out in thier own unqiue way.  As there is alot of dialogue, so to must there be good writing and voice direction, I don't have much to say about the writing as I tend not to really notice the writing if I'm enjoying the game enough, I like to learn about the world so I can get more involved in the game, which I was, I can say that the voice direction of the main cast is superb, they all gave a performance as if they was there and experiencing what their character counter-parts was, a big thumbs up for that, but a number of other characters sound like the absolute stock of stock, you know those really cringe worthy voices you hear in actual shows? There are a few present here, but it's easy to overlook them, especially since the main cast of characters are good enough in missions.  Art style gets a massive thumbs up from me, I'm not a huge fan of anime, but I'm a sucker for any kind of cartoonish art style in games, as mentioned it uses a watercolour esque look with an intentional anime art design, the both combine extremely well together, sound direction was also top notch, keeping in touch with it's world war style to making you feel like you're apart of a larger battle in some fights, the soundtrack as well, splendid and superb.  My only complaints come in the form of some tibids of gameplay and a rather weak late early to mid game story. First off for gameplay, get used into the habit of finishing your units turn  AS SOON AS YOU ARE DONE  because when you take control of a character, enemy units that are looking as that unit will fire on you due to what's refferred to as reactive fire, most of the time this will result in cheap hits and could potentially screw you over, so again, finish your action as soon as, there is also no way to speed up or skip the opponents turn, forcing you to observe every little thing that they do, not a huge complaint being a turn based strategy, but it can be noticible.  The late early to mid game story felt so weak to me though, the beginning of the game is so good, you are protecting the countryside land of Bruhl and introduced to your main characters effectively, learn a bit about them and such, then the empire begin attacking the evacuating civilians, like literally killing them, after buying time for the rest of the populace to escape, hope is slowly lost as you are forced to retreat, Alicia and Welkin then proceed to have a extremely well performed discussion of the horrors of war. Later on they would both go on to be conscripted by the military, sounds like it's going to get really rough for our protagonists doesn't it? Well after that, nobody seems to realise that they're fighting a war and it distracted the heck out of me, where was the panic of being young adults thrusted into the military backbone? A young mans uncertainty of being placed as squad leader with these lives in his hands? It's not until around chapter 9 where the story really starts to pick itself back up and by chapter 10 when you are introduced to Zaka (Voiced by the one and only Steve Blum) the cast really start to remember whats happening.  Honestly though, the more I played, the more intrested I got in seeing what happened next in the story after a mission, it definately gets more and more better toward the end as the tensions between the Empire and Gallia highten. The ending was actually really touching.  In the end, I really experimented with this game and I'm very glad I did, It was a surprisingly fun 30 hours of gameplay and I might play through it again at some point, If you like JRPGs, you'll likely love this, if you're a fan of turn based strategy looking for another fix, then I'd recommend giving Valkyria Chronicles a try, challenging, fun and intresting, maybe you should try to kick the Empire out of Gallia."
"Immersed so much in the game, I played it 2 days straight till it finishes."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a somewhat typical S/TRPG (strategy/tactical RPG) that's been wrapped in a beautiful artistic vision and unique gameplay persepctive. Most of the common elements of tactical RPGs are here. Take control of the units you've selected from your squad, place them within your starting area and using Command Points move them during your turn within their movement radius and take one action. Once all the command points have been spent the turn is passed to the AI who does all their moves and then again back to you tiill either the objective is completed or failure on your part.   There are 5 of classes in the game, Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer, Engineer and Sniper. Also there is a tank(s) that you command as well as the different classes. Before each map you can choose what number soldiers from each class you take into the battlefield, some maps may require to load up on certain classes while forgoing a class entirely. Most of the classes are also able to choose between a couple of different weapons/load outs so you can either favour accuracy, damage or status effects. In addition to different classes and load outs there are also various orders to be given in battle (each order costs command points).  The best parts of the game to me were the Characters, level design and perspective. The third person perspective made for a unique experience in a tactical RPG rather than a typical grid. The Characters were great. The design to them as well as their lore all worked to drawyou in to the RPG experience. And lastly the level design. There was a good variety of levels, from cities, to forests and deserts. The levels also had different design elements and objective focuses to make each level interesting as well as replayable.  Some of the things that I was Neutral on was the Story and Leveling/progression system. After each victory you would be awarded a certain number of EXP points that could be spent on the training grounds to level up characters. Leveling up the characters didn't really result in traidtional RPG gains but would be used to unlock various class traits that would affect how that a character of that class would react to certain battlefield conditions. The leveling up seemed to have a minimal effect on things like HP (your starting HP won't be much different from end game HP). I did like that there was a variety of skirmish missions that could be done to grind for more experience or gold.   Some of the things I didn't like about the game were the Story, the interface and randomness. The story was okay, but was very typical of a JRPG. There was only one moment for me in the entire story that wasn't just generic JRPG storyline. Some of the big suprises were not very surprising and a lot of characters took very generic character paths, which is sad cause the I like the characters themselves, they had charm. As for the interface, there are a few things missing from the game that feel like it should be there. You can only save outside of missions, there is no ability to save mid mission and with some missions that are on the longer side, it can be a bit of a pain. As well you are shown how many shots it will take to kill an enemy (body vs head) but you are not given any percentages on if those shots will actually hit the target, so you are told that it will take 4 shots to kill an enemy but you are not told that you might only have a 50% chance of hitting the target. The AI could also be kind of infuriating because there is no option to skip the opponents turn animations (as far as I figured out anyways) and on some of the maps there is a lot of enemy actions to go through. Some of the Keyboard and Mouse controls can also be kind of wonky. Driving the tank(s) with Keyboard and mouse can be very very frustrating. One last thing I didn't really enjoy was that for the majority of the game you could load up on one character class with 2-3 other classes as support to power through the game.  Overall I felt that the game is very solid and definately worth the time to go through. The game can be found on sale pretty often these days for 5-10$ so it's pretty solid value as well."
"Brothers in Arms &amp; new Xcom had a baby,  and it turned out Anime &amp; awesome."
Definitely one of my top three games!
"I can make a squad of gay boys, lesbians, and a bisexual. One squad member is even a masochist. Best game ever."
Best game of this type i have ever played. pros- -cool story -tactical -difficult at times -squad customization -weapon and vehicle upgrades -interesting menus -skirmishes -squad leveling  cons- -port makes some things feel awkward (mostly in the menu though) -your controlled person can sometimes move awkwardly (ex. when you push forward he moves too fast so it can be hard ot position yourself properly) -no option for difficulty in campaign mode
O R D E R  Yeah I'd recommend it.
"This game has a perfect balance between water colour styled anime, strategy game and a 3rd person shooter. If you like anime, jrpg, shooters, strategy, and an amazing storyline, it's your loss if you don't spend the $20. It deserves a perfect/perfect"
"Simply one of the best JRPG's mixed with Strategy and 3rd Person Shooter-esque gameplay that is both challenging and fun. SEGA really outdid themselves with this PC port which has no errors, nor framerate issues. The price of $19.99 is also very reasonable considering it comes with the original game's DLCs for free! If you're a fan of Historical wars and true military games, this is a must-have! 10/10."
awesome game had to buy it since i never finished it in PS3
"I expected an embellishment of the worst that mankind has ever devised, people killing people, but this story is different. It's about borders and bridges, occupation and the timide flying piglet Hans. [review closed]"
"Good game with bad PC controls and some really dumb save mechanics, save after everything you do or be prepairsed to repeat huge chunks of the game."
"Story is ♥♥♥♥, as with all JRPGs. Gameplay is great, its what XCOM: Declassified should have been. The rating system for the missions are kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ though."
"Very enjoyable! Interesting storyline and nice graphics that combine to give a great anime feel. Although the AI is rather disappointing, missions are set up in such a way that the gameplay is still challenging and interesting. Expect to have to restart missions regularly. Story, missions and optional skirmishes combine to give the game a decent length as well."
"This game is absolutely wonderful! graphics, soundtrack, the port is amazingly good and the GAMEPLAY omfg the gameplay is so awesome and challenging, game full of content at the beginning youre going to feel so amazed because of so many thing you can do. Characters... the characters... this is a game were main and side characters are extremely useful, the mixed of this game are the long cinematics and the white frame, that is in the whole game IMO. but that doesnt make the game bad is still very good and enjoyable 9.5/10 :D"
"Phenomenal game. I never had a PS3, so I was unable to ever play this, but I'm extremely glad it's come to Steam. I'm only part way through it right now, but I love the gameplay, art style, characters, everything. Definitely a must buy if you're into strategy games."
Think X-COM but with an anime harem. 12 year old girls viciously murdering alternative-history nazis and then making cute anime faces and expressions.  Also a videogame with an almost direct parallel to jews and concentration camps.  Also also gigantic anime howitzer boobs.
"Never played it (or anything like it) before, now I can't get enough of it! Addictive!"
This was an incredible PS3 exclusive. I loved it. I haven't played much of the PC port yet but it seems like they did a great job at first glance.
Excellent game. Well worth the money. Gets surprisingly tactical after a few hours gameplay. 10/10
I love this game.  Have played a tonne of TBS games but this is my favourite. Please let the other two have remakes and put on PC.
"Pros: Excellent game for an excellent price.  Gameplay is unique and fun. The game is beautiful. The story is engaging.  Con:  The tanks. They're awesome and helpful, but annoying at the same time. They seem to have a seizure everytime I use them, and their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ness is wasting precious AP's!"
"Awesome game but the AI is poor, making the game easy Exelent story too "
Similar elements to X-COM. Great water color art like graphics. Amazing gameplay. Recommended to everyone.
"To me the game mechanic looks not suitable for a strategy game. Not being able to predict/plan movements and attacks is constant source of frustration. This gets even worse since the game actively promotes YLO-like plays to finish the mission as fast as possible.  As for the story, it's mediocre at best and not nearly enough to compensate for broken gameplay. "
A jap port that isn't ♥♥♥♥
"XCOM ragings with anime, waifus (and husbandos), jews and french estonians with english names speaking japanese.  Pls nerf Alicia. - Sincerely, The Empire.   The main character has never driven a tank before. The game portrays the fact perfectly.  Buy it."
For me...I didnt like turn-based strategy game much But for this game I recommend How? -Story is great  -lovely art style  -Don't rush to your enemy's front  -good control (I recommend for using controller)  -lots of upgrade  -likes x-com but TPS  -cute victory pose  -challenging  -enemy can dodge your attack 5-time in roll (lol)  -can headshot   -Every Squad's members have their own back ground story and some of them have a story together   -Free DLC  -Need brains to play  This game is good with controller but no mouse support for using keyboard and you cant skip through enemy's turn So sometime you have to wait so long  P.S. I wonder how 12 year old kids join the squad   Why squad have only small boobs? Where is my Oppai ?!
"Many people have posted their thoughts on this game. To get to the point, after playing the first mission you will be hooked. Easy as that, just buy it...you know you want to.  10/10"
It was quite a long adventure. I'm glad I finished it. Totally worth every penny.
"We should all be glad this one made its way to PC. Having never owned a PS3 I'm glad I had a chance to play it. I thoroughly enjoyed the unique and fantastic gameplay.  + Top-notch turn-based, strategy gameplay. + A decent story. + Unique art style which looks amazing and will ensure the game doesn't look dated for years to come.  - Huge deadzone with xbox controller, small aim movements were a major pain (I knew about the dpad). - No auto saves (game explicitly tells you to save after missions).  Playtime: ~ 36h 9/10"
"Just started playing this game on PC, but I played through the entire game when it released for PS3. It's my favorite strategy game. It runs very well on PC. Must buy!"
"When i found out Valkyria Chronicles, one of my favorite anime series, was coming to pc, i was a little nervous. i wasn't exactly confident in a pc port of the game being of good quality. To my surprise, it was perfect. Everything i was looking for was there. 10/PrettyDamnGood- Give them your money."
"Valkyria Chronicles is an interesting game. The story is rich, the detail put into the characters is deeper than most games today, and the art style is one of a kind. A strange mix of strategy and JRPG, Valkyria Chronicles will put you in charge of a platoon of soldiers. As you progress, you'll be able to recruit more, and will be forced to change your roster as locations shift.  It also has a unique homeage to older SEGA games like Skies of Arcadia by bringing in some recognizable characters into the frey. Though these characters aren't cannon per se, they do add a bit of unique flavor to the game. But even so, Valkyria Chronicles focuses on some interesting gameplay that makes each battle more diffucult than the last. Maybe your team is divided, maybe the enemies have more tanks. Who can say.  The units of your platoon act similarly to Rock Paper Scissors. Consisting of Lancers, Scouts, Assualt, Engineers, and Snipers. Scouts beat Assualt, Assualt beat Lancers, Lancers beat Tanks, and so on. The real odd ones out of this though is the Engineers and Snipers who act as supports mostly. The combinations of troopers is ever changing, and permadeath is a threat if you aren't careful.   Overall, I highly suggest Valkyria Chronicles. While it is an older game, it has held the test of time, and is still better than most things Ubisoft."
"I was not interested in this game. I don't like cartoonish style graphics and games that appear have a very simple plot. Nevertheless I've got this game as a part of a bundle and decided to give it a try simply due to community reviews.  Honestly, I glad I did. Yes the controls are somewhat glitchi, yes, the story does appear to be simple, but, at the same time the game delivers a well balanced strategic element, but most importantly, when you read through the story and give it a though it draws very interesting parallels and observations.  This is an interactive story with game elements (not the other way around) as it is the well crafted, even though simple story that wins you over.  One Grumpy Russian score - 7/10 awwwwwwww, no vodka needed here.  For more reviews join my group at  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview/  "
"This will probably be the most human war-game you ever play. The characters and story are very human, choosing to reflect on what people lose in war beyond the obvious. The most memorable scene involves a civil conversation between the main character and an enemy officer, and while I won't spoil it, the developers made sure that you recognized early on that the people you were fighting were human. They want to go back to their families as much as you do. The art style is somewhat unique (that's a good thing), the voice acting is generally spot on too. I found the story compelling, and you'll want to know what happens next. As for the gameplay, it's a satisfying strategy game with a unique blend between X-com style command and a 3rd person shooter. Rather than simply issue orders, you actually use a command point to take control of a unit directly, guiding where they move and aiming for them. The game is based on WWII, and combat *usually* has an air of realism to it consequently. Don't expect enemies to just watch you shoot them in the face. Some enemies will actually hit the deck if they're looking when you open fire, and if one of your units runs within the line of sight and range of an enemy unit, they (the enemy) will empty the clip, reload and repeat as long as that unit continues moving. This works for both sides though, and so don't expect any unit, whether friend or foe to run through a hailstorm of bullets unscathed... unless it's a tank. Yes, this game has tanks, and realistically, tanks dominate everything else, effective use of your tank is critical to success. It is both a mobile wall of steel to shield your soldiers, and a force of pure destruction. The game has perma-death, but this is generally avoidable since an allied unit can call for a medic if they can get to the injured unit within 3 turns, of course if an enemy unit gets there first that's it. My only complaint is that sometimes the odds end up stacked against you so much (and realistically there is no way they wouldn't be... you're basically Belgium trying to fight the Nazis) that you have to cheese your way through some of the stages. The strategy seems to dip towards the end as well, once history has really started diverge in the game.   This game is both a great introduction to strategy games (and to a lesser extent JRPG's) and a challenge to veteran strategy gamers... while a slow crawl might work in the end, you are graded based on the number of turns it took you, and who doesn't want triple Xp and gold for that A rank?  TLDR; This game is awesome, mixes X-com style command with third person shooter control. Great story, and you get a tank. Who has played a WWII game and not wanted to just mow down the enemy front line with a tank? Now you can... for entirely strategic purposes of course."
"An outstanding port of one of the best games to be released on the PS3 during its lifetime, at a ridiculously low $20 'full price'. Fantastic art style and production qualities combined with very solid tactical gameplay and squad management. Highly recommended."
"I ran a guy over with my tank, yet he still managed to survive. 8/10 game, should have let me hit him with my sword."
"This is how you make a port.  The game is great! Good story, good strategic elements, nice graphics, etc. "
"Solid PC port from the PS3 game, quite well done. The graphics style is quite refreshing and looks good as well. The gameplay is also quite interesting, consisting of a rather intersting blend of RPG/TPS/FPS/TBS elements that make for unique gameplay (although quite abusable in some missions/skirmishes) Haven't completed the game yet, so can't comment much on the story, but so far willing to give it 10/10."
"This game truly was a masterpice.With artistic graphic, interesting story, good soundtrack, and good gameplay. Definitely not regret buying this game."
"Have a tank, shoot everything 12/10"
"Great story, wonderful artwork, interesting combat mechanics. Highly recommended to any JRPG and/or tactical turn-based combat fan."
This game is amost perfect.
9.3/10 would make the female militias moans again in the middle of a battle.
"Awsome Strategy, slow start but this has got to be my all time favourite strategy.   BUY IT NOW!!!"
"This is one of the best RPG's released during the Wii/PS3/360 generation. It was severely overlooked on PS3, but it is amazing game. It's a Strategy RPG, but you have full control over characters in action, sort of like a Third Person Shooter. The story is also really good. I know people will say 'BUT ANIME' however, this isn't your horrible anime of today. This has some great moments as well as great characters all around. I guarantee you that you won't be disappointed. It's well worth the price Sega is asking and more."
"anime world war II with norse godesses instead of nukes   really good game, best SRPG i've played in a very long time"
"Great port to PC, only real issue is with the tank controls tweaking out with mouse input. English voice acting a bit odd at times, graphics are good for its era. Customization of your army is fun but missions can be tricky. You become invested in your characters and really dont want any to get perma death."
Probably one of the most underrated and inovative game I have ever played. A must play.
"FYI THIS IS BEING WRITTEN WHILE I AM ONLY HALFWAY THRU THE GAME!  This game is fantastic. The gameplay is solid and engaging, the graphics are superb, and it is just overall beautiful. The more I play the more interested I am in the characters, and the world. For the longest time I couldnt play this game due to it being ps3, and I am so happy thats not the case anymore. Buy this game. buy your friends this game. Tell others to buy it. This is a JRPG that deserves tons more attention."
"Amazing depth, visuals, and the port makes it feel as though PC is the true home for this game."
I have no words... Its just amazing! 10/10
All we need now is a Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 please sega
I never got to play this on the PS3 but snatched it up so fast when I saw it hit steam since it has just about everything you could want from a game.  Cool alternate history storyline: Check Cast of memerable and unique characters: Check Gameplay that is fun and yet brings new things to the table: Check Tons of codex entries about the people and things in the world: Check Replayability: Doublecheck  Honestly this is going in my top 10 games of the last 10 years easy. Its a breath of fresh air in a genre that usually gets stuck playing the newest Final Fantasy.
Probably one of the better console ports you'd be able to play. I highly recommend it.
"Combat mechanics and interface is solid.  Cel shading and environment renders have had no issues so far  Loved this game on PS3, I hope with the successful launch of this series on PC we will see the chronicles continue, far into the future..."
"This is a beautiful game, both to the eyes and ears and it plays great too. I played the hell out of it on the PS3 and re-brought it on the PC and have been loving it all over again. It's the same glorious game but with no loading times! If only Sega hadn't switched the sequels to the PSP. Who knows, maybe if this does well they will have a rethink on the franchise, port (and translate in 3's case) them to PC and then we can all enjoy them. Advice for anyone that hasn't played before, you get the best rank by finishing in the fewest turns, don't worry about killing every enemy on the map, just hit that main objective!"
"Well considering that I have played 26 hours in a span of 3 days, if you were to ask me if I enjoyed this game I would slap you across the face and question your sanity. In short this game is a huge time waster for people that enjoy JRPGs and SRPGs. Whenever I play this game I get a feeling that only Fire Emblem has made me feel so far. Maybe that's the reason I adore Valkyria Chronicles so much!"
Drives a perfectionist like me crazy as you can only play each story once but it's so satisfying once you full clear something.
"Interesting story amd great world building, but worst tank controls and menu navigation that I have ever seen."
"First and foremost this is behavior we should applaud from a publisher. Even a big one. And even if that publisher takes notoriously bad approaches with other games (DLC's, etc). This one, they got it right. They brought a 'cult hit' PS3 exclusive to the PC and took the time to do it right, without DLC's, and at a reasonable price. I hope it had (and continues to have) great sales and the publisher takes note.  With that out of the way, on to the game. The port to PC is fantastic! I cannot undersell that at all. Obviously gamepad controls are flawless but the keyboard and mouse controls are fluid and what I used. Frame rate never dips below 60 and the game looks superb in modern PC resolutions. The game itself is a slow paced tactical, turn-based, strategy game that looks beautiful and has a rich and deep storyline and characters. But it isn't without it's flaws and is probably going to be an 'acquired taste' for many, if not most. I will touch on a few things below.   Technical hiccups I encountered personally; -I had some crash on exit issues that seem to be related to Steam Overlay. Turning Overlay off stopped it. Though I often just dealt with it because I wanted Overlay for screenshots. And crashing on exit isn't the end of the world, I was exiting anyway! -Minimal tearing on some cutscenes. Non-issue for me personally but I mention it for the sticklers out there. -Steam now recommends a bunch of pervy anime games to me since I poured over 40hrs into this.  Gameplay issues some might have. 'Fair warning' stuff basically; -It IS slow. And failing a mission means going through the same slow steps again. -The game will breed impatience in some. Every mission does have an 'A' rank way to beat it swiftly. So there is this inherent 'feeling' that you can be brazen and act swiftly to beat any level. BUT, these tactics are mostly reserved for the second playthrough with a much much more powerful squad at your fingertips. Patience and caution is the name of the game the first playthrough! -Also on that note, the game will throw new obstacles, tactics, and effects at you each mission. Especially in the second half of the game. Not taking the time to read (also read between the lines of) warnings and plan ahead will result in what feels like a 'cheap' death. But in reality the game lays everything out and you have the time to learn 'on the fly' as long as you're taking your time. I learned my lesson the hard way more times than I care to admit before I slowed down my pace and started thinking like Welkin (protagonist) rather than me the modern impatient gamer.  Regardless of any neglible issue or 'fair warning', with sales at multiple online gaming outlets and here already reaching as low as $4.99USD it's worth the throwaway just to support the developer's behavior on this approach. Even if the publisher doesn't need the money and is huge. This is a rare (maybe only) moment where I can recommend a purchase even if you have no intention of playing. That said, if you DO play it and DO take your time to 'acquire the taste' you will be handsomely rewarded for your efforts. This game was a thoroughly satisfying play and experience and ranks atop my short list of all time favorites. Yes, ALL TIME FAVORITES. It is damn good. The game is fun, lengthy, deeply well written, well voice-acted, beautiful, and smooth. A pleasure. I had great fun in my 40+ hours of play and I still have extras, hard and expert modes, and more left to enjoy should I want to! One last random note; I've never watched an anime outside of Cowboy Bebop so I can say with emphasis that the art style goes beyond that crowd. It really is a lovely game visually.  Easily recommended."
"This is the kind of game, you want to give your time. This is the game you break out the pen and paper to plan for the next combat. This is THE game to play"
"So...  First off, don't listen to the folks who call it XCOM or Final Fantasy Tactics style. This is something else that I can't quite classify. You have a certain amount of points you can spend on actions each round from an overview of the battlefield marking known troop locations and terrain features. Soldiers use one point, your uber-tank uses 2 per turn. You can use the same unit multipe times each turn, but you lose movement every time you do. When you select a unit, you're dropped into a 3rd person position in control of them and you have a meter that is burned while you run/take cover. During this time enemies are shooting at you eternally until you take the one shot you're alloted or end the turn. If you stand there not burning your turn energy, you'll die from enemy fire. When you go into shoot mode, the game pauses to let you line up your shot and take it. Then if you have any energy left you can dart back to cover, or just end the turn.  Between rounds your units heal a little, or a ton if they are in favorable conditions, like a camp. It's pretty sweet actually.  The real unique system here is that every troop you field (and there are dozens to pick from) has a unique set of personality traits that can give benefits and disadvantages during combat. As you train the squad more traits are unlocked, for better or for worse. Some units like others, and this causes special events to trigger when they are close to one another. It's as confusingly deep as any JRPG, but isn;t too hard to wrap your head around.  You can spend XP and cash earned to upgrade weapons and tank modules. There is a set of skirmish maps that aren;t tied to the story you can repeat endlessly for XP/cash, but if you lose a unit in them they're still gone forever.  Bottom line: 10/10. Solid port, fun story so far, and I want to keep playing instead of doing Dad stuff or sleeping."
"The presentation and aesthetics of this game are simply amazing. It looks and feels like an anime, yet narrated like an audio history book. The vignette and color pencil filter also adds to the charm.  The tactical battles are a little different than most, and not always in a good way, but overall the gameplay is very satisfying. The game rewards rushing 1-2 units behind enemy lines to capture points which is not what most strategy games promote. If you can get over this little weirdness, you'll enjoy this game.  A lot of games have challenge scenarios that I normally just ignore, but the challenges in this game lets you unlock new weapons and gain xp/money for the main campaign, so I played them a lot more than I would have in other similar games. This adds a lot to the replay value and there's also a new game + mode.   I normally only buy discounted games but I think this title is worth picking up at full price, If you see it on sale, and don't absolutely hate anime, then definitely pick it up."
"My god is this one of my absolute alltime favorites. When I first heard about Sega porting this over to pc, it took me all of 3 seconds to preorder. This game has by far one of the greatest turn based systems I have ever seen and the port runs just as smoothly as the original console version. Recommend this game to anyone who enjoys jrpg's and turn based strategy."
I play it for the plot.
"Honestly? This is the only war/military setting game I ever liked, ever. In a genre saturated with obtuse masculinity, obnoxious patriotism and armchair general daydreams, this character-driven tale that treats every piece on the metaphorical chessboard like a thinking, feeling entity is worth more than a thousand Call of Duty iterations. That alone, especially if you always wanted to experience the genre but were turned off by the above, is enough reason to try this game.  But I understand that's a very personal stance, so let's speak objectively. The art direction is fantastic, the setting is satisfying and rich, the gameplay is a bit trial-and-error at times but it's only a problem if you absolutely must get that S-rank (remember, speed &gt; efficiency when it comes to that). You're actually encouraged to treat your soldiers as people and not cannon fodder, because their individual potentials synergize with each other and friends will team up against enemies. Also the Steam port won't lose to the original console version in terms of quality and features. So in short: if you didn't play this game on PS3, play it now. You won't regret it."
Just cleared the campaign after 40 hours spent in game and all I want is more more more!!!!!  It is like Fire Emblem with guns. And that is a beautiful beautiful thing. Just get it. After the first three missions you will be absolutely sold on this game.
"If you like turn-based tactical RPGs, you'll love Valkyria Chronicles. If you don't, give it a try anyway, you might change your mind!  Now that I've completed the game, it's time for a somewhat more elaborate reasoning why the game is worth your time.   Visually, the game is very appealing unless you hate anime with a passion. The watercolour style art is pleasant for the eyes although it does diminish the warlike feel a bit.  The sound component is not exactly stellar, but it's far from being bad. Voice acting: Regardless of which voiceover you choose, you shouldn't have a problem with it. All in all, the sound is good enough.  So where does this game get to shine? It's of course the fun and challenging missions. Even though the AI tends to sometimes do ridiculous things, every victory feels like it's deserved. A fair number missions will truly test your strategies, and a few of them will test your patience as well. In particular, boss fights often require some serious thought. Be patient, observe and try things out. And if you do get stuck, the community is happy to help, just ask.  Onto the flaws: It is mostly addressing people who love a good challenge and can appear unpatronizing to an average gamer.  Second, the ranking system, which only rewards a quick completion of missions rather than tactics, which is a bit absurd, considering that a war-themed game SHOULD be a lot about tactics. But still, you can ignore the ranking system, as you can always replay the main story missions (and skip almost all cutscenes in the runs after the 1st) as many times as you like and try to get an A-rank.  The verdict: 9.1/10"
truly loving this game.
Love it.
World War Waifu
One of the greatest games of all time just got better.  Pros:  -Build the ultimate waifu army -Glorious 60FPS -Audrey -Beautiful graphics -Overpowered Alicia -Laura Bailey is a voice actress -David Attenbourgh leads the squad  Cons:  -Non
"10/10, OH MEIN GOTT 10/10!   I CAN COMMAND MY OWN MOESQUAD HOLY GAEB THANK YOU WILL PAY 9000 RUBLES FOR MULTIPLEER PLOX"
This was one of my all time favorite games on the PS3 and I was stoked to see a port to PC as I no long have a PS3. However this game has major framerate issues. The framerate is stable but incredibly slow painful almost. To put it another way I had tie to dodge incoming bullets at point blank range
You play a ragtag militia from Not-Switzerland after the country is invaded by the Not-Nazis who have taken over most of Not-Europe and are seeking artifacts of power from the Not-Aryan bloodline. Along the way there is casual racism against Not-Jews and literal pig with wings.
Worth every penny.
This is one of the best games i ever played and its a must buy no other words are needed
"Great PC port for an amazing PS3 game. Get it if you like turn-based, squad-based, action-based, waifu-based strategy games!"
"So what is this 'Valkyria Chronicles' everyone's fussing about? Is it another Norse mythology thingy? Not in the slightest. 'Valkyria Chronicles' is a (former PS3 exclusive) Turn-based Strategy JRPG heavily inspired by World War II.  The story is set in the continent of 'Europa,' which is basically Europe in the early 20th century with the borders redrawn and a few fantasy elements thrown in here and there. The continent is currently embroiled in its second 'Europa War' waged between the Federation in the west and the Empire to the east. Caught in between these two superpowers is the nation of Gallia. A tiny principality of less than a million people which is caught in the crossheirs of the Empire, who're lusting after Gallia's vast reserves of Ragnite (the setting's all-purpose Phlebotinum). However, Gallia has one big thing going for them: EVERYONE AND THEIR MOE LITTLE SISTERS ARE *REQUIRED* TO HAVE MILITARY TRAINING.   Enter Welkin Gunther (who's first and last names I keep getting mixed up), a Gallian university student who returns to his hometown of Bruhl just before it gets sacked by the Empire. After escaping Bruhl with his adoptive sister, Isara and his (not immediately) obvious love interest, Alicia, Welkin enlists in the Gallian Militia in order to defend his homeland. This being a JRPG, you probably have guessed that it will have at least some of the stock JRPG tropes, but I'll digress.  Battles take place on two 'layers,' a map from which you issue 'orders' (which are usually buffs that you can grant to your units) and select units to control. Upon selecting a unit, the map zooms in and becomes a third-person-over-the-shoulder-shooter-ish-thingy from which you'll have to transition from moving to aiming/firing at enemies (you can't move and shoot at the same time, kinda like 'Resident Evil 4' to an extent).  Your infantry units are made up of five classes: Scouts, who have the most mobility of your troops, but no baseball bats. Shocktroopers, who can deal lots of damage to enemy but lack mobility and have little accuracy. Lancers, who--WHY THE HELL DID WE NOT INVENT EXPLOSIVE ORDINANCE THAT COMES OFF THE TIP OF A LANCE HERE IN THE REAL WORLD?!--are your anti-tank guys. Engineers, who lack southern accents but make up for it in the ability to disarm mines, repair friendly tanks, and set up cover. And Snipers, who *aren't* compelled to throw jars of urine at your foes. In addition to these classes, you also have a tank called the 'Edelweiss' (not so 'small and white' this time).  But to conclude, I think 'Valkyria Chronicles' is a very solid JRPG with some interesting ideas and is quite worthy of the attention it's been getting. Buy it. It's cheap compared to how it was when it first came out."
"First off, I was never fond of this type of games. Strategy yes, but this is the first turn based game that could convince me. And it did well. This is one of the best games, if not the best, that I've ever played.   Cons:  -graphics (for those who need high end graphics; I'm fine with it) -Skirmish maps are the same as campaign, just without the story background  Pros:  +Story (Epic) +Gameplay (Easy to learn but still challenging enough, especially when meeting new foes) +Characters (Deep) +Soldiers and Weapons (plenty)  +Anime/Drawn Style +DLC's included +Customize soldiers, weapons and TANKs (go Edelweiss!!!)  I highly recommend this game  11/10  Drive these Imperials back out of Gallia !! Squad seven move out !!"
"Exceptional game. Every unit is unique and has backstory, advantages, and disadvantages. Kind of a mix between visual novel and SRPG. One of the most in-depth tactical games I've ever played."
"Excellent game. Not gonna lie, the story is cheesy and over-the-top goody goody, and many of the scenes are almost nauseatingly PG, but even so its a story that makes you care. If you liked FFT, you'll love this. Because its much better. Unlike the generic characters you get in games like that, these are characters that can die under your command and you will get to know as individuals through combat. Each character has unique slogans, sayings, and skills that will make picking your squad agonizing each time.  As to the gameplay, watch some of the videos and you'll get the gist. Its basically perfect.  So in summary. Not a great story, but great characters, and fantastic gameplay."
fapped all the way through 32/32 faps great experience even though it was painfull a boner of the size and shape of japan
"I brought my own tank and got made an officer, GG.  No, but seriously, this game is amazing, hell, you even get all the DLC. The only BIG problem is for me that its sequel (which I hear isn't as good, but nevertheless) has yet to be announced to be ported to PC. Why is this related to this game? Because no matter how good a game is, you can only play through it so many times.  tl;dr: For every minute that you do NOT buy this game, a puppy dies."
"Highly recomend for anyone who is into strategy games. It is hard to play due to the strategy required to survive, but gradualy gets easier as you get the hang of it. Though it is like chess, you can do all ot more for choosing your next move. The story is amasing as well (they also made an anime of this game, and its just as amasing)."
"New review:  Honestly, I don't know if I recommend this game or not. It has a lot of good things, but is has a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t too. The most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t thing are the invisible walls. I mean, If you shoot with a rock or a wall near where you aim, some bullets hit that obstacle, even when you clearly see that the bullet didn't hit them.  Original review:  It's like Fire Emblem with guns.  The PC port runs great, you can use the mouse to chose the units and aiming... but you can't use it for menus. Why? It's stupid. Another thing that sucks is the UI. If you could use the mouse in menus it would fix this.  Aside of that, the game is a great turn-based strategy game, where you select a unit and then control it, making it run, shoot or any other thing the unit type can do.  This game is more forgiving than Fire Emblem in the permadeath topic. If a unit dies but you touch it, a Medic evacuates it so it doesn't die, but if the enemy touches it, hes dead. The good thing is that you level up the unit types, not the unit themselves, so if someone dies, the lost is not big, unless you liked that character.  One think I don't really like is that you control the units more than you do in Fire Emblemm, and you depend more on luck here. For aiming you have on circle, and the bullet can go anywhere inside of it, so you may aim to the head but miss the shot. It's the worst thing in the game by far. It wouldn't be that bad if the snipers had a smaller circle and you could shoot rockets without being at 1 meter of the target. The enemies had this, so they can miss a lot too, but it still sucks. Later on you can upgrade your weapons, so they are more precise, but until then...  Chpater 7 is cancer, but there are cheats avaiable.  I recommend the game if you like turn based games and you don't hate anime."
"Excellent. Slow to start, but picks up in a big way. 9/10"
"This game may not be for everyone, especially those who have no patience on cutscenes or those who hate losing so much. If you can get by pass that flaw, you're seriously awesome for trying. But if you judge the game based on negative reviews, you'll be missing out a lot from this gem.    Gameplay"
"This is one of those few games. Those few games that can draw emotion.  This is one of those few games. Games that can perfectly execute that brilliant ballance between turn-based combat and real time combat. If somebody tells you this is an RTS, they're not wrong. If somebody tells you this is a third person shooter, they're not wrong. If somebody tells you this is a game where you blow ♥♥♥♥ up, well tell them they're stating the obvious because you blow ♥♥♥♥ up in like 90% of modern games. In all honest, this is a wonderful game with great gameplay. My only beef with it is it's use of traditional anime tropes and plot twists you can see from a klom away. Play this game. And when you're done go watch the anime."
Its like if your personal waifu war involved an actual war.  9/10
Very competent port from the PS3 version and at a price which is more than decent (it even includes all the original DLC).
"Havent finsihed , but very fun and unique Stratgey JPRG. Would bake a loaf of bread again"
"At first I really enjoyed the game. The battles are fun, and I enjoyed the strategy involved in completing a scenario. Though I always wondered why I could never get an A rank, so I read some guides to see what I was doing wrong. Turns out, speed only matters. So all you really do, is take some scouts, run up to everything, and shoot it point blank in the face. Thats it. Or have an objective you need to capture on the other side of the map? Just run past everything with your scout, go to the objective, and shoot everything in the face. A ranking.   It really takes the fun out of the game. So I just play it how I want to, slowly and planned out. I have more fun, but get less experience and money. Which just means more skirmishes. I'd recommend the game despite this. It really is enjoyable when you dont worry about the rank after the battle, and I enjoed the storyline as well."
"Banged already on PS3, so what are you waitin` for? Like my friend said:'This game is Militaristic, Tactical with Anime-like graphics - it was made for a people like u' 20/10"
I can finally play Fire Emblem on my PC!
"Great game overall, great story, great characters, great gameplay.  The only downfalls are that the menu controls are garbage(if you use mouse and keyboard) and the sequels are PSP exclusives."
"A very solid tactical RPG/strategy game in the vein of X-Com. Vakyria Chronicles puts its own spin on things, allowing you to directly control the members of your squad as if it were a third person shooter. This makes the game quite engaging as puts you directly in the battlefield instead of just being a cold detached overhead observer.   Your units all have their own personalties (some better than others) and quirks, such as hating city environments, 'fancying' a certain gender, or claustrophobia, all of which have an effect on that characters stats or their squads stats. Additionally money and experience earned on missions can be spent to upgrade your units and their gear.  The game is quite story heavy at times, luckily it's actually a pretty good story with decent writing, better than 'Oh no, aliens are attacking, kill them. Oh no, more aliens!' in any case. The setting is essentially 'WWII but not actually WWII', pitting Western democracies of Europa (definitely not like Europe in any way, don't be silly) against the East Europan Empire which is Soviet Russia or National Socialist Germany or something. Sometimes you might wish they would hurry things up so you can get back in the action, but the story is engaging enough that you probably won't want to skip the cutscenes. The voice over work is pretty good overall considering it's a dub, at the very least it isn't distracting. Battle SFX are good as well.  Some people probably won't be able to look past the anime-esque artstyle although it's not as in your face as some other games. This is a port and it shows: limited graphics options and the controls are bit odd. The mouse can be used in battles just fine but for whatever reason it can't be used to navigate menus. Tank controls definitely leave a bit to be desired at times as well.  Overall a solid 8.5-9/10."
Fire Emblem but with TANKS
"Great game, I only wish they would make more of them. even watched the anime after finishing the game. This is a MUST HAVE!"
My only regret about this game is that the other two in the series have yet to be ported over to pc. Awesome tactical game that comes loaded with a bunch of dlc goodies for no extra charge.
"valkyria chronicles is indeed challenging the beginning ops were easy but from late mid-game it got hard characters are very binded to one another although lacking complex emotions and stuff it's passable lore is simple as well, valkyries, warmachines powered by some magical stone i'd say the same with the gameplay and game engine above all, the best quality about the game is the simplicity, i love how Welkin and Alicia portray a heartwarmingly normal romance, haven't seen that in a while most plots nowadays involve characters with their tryhard 'unique' personalities/traits  "
10/10 Homer best character.
"Pros: Touches on issues not usualy examined in WW2 like games.  Well built combat mechanics Interesting story  Cons: (my personal observation, may be different for others) The computer seems to bend the rules of the game slightly because it's a computer. For example, very rarely does the computer fire a shot that will miss. A sniper will spam body shots until your unit dies. Out of the blue, a tank on the other side of the map will somehow get line of sight on one of your soldiers, get a perfect headshot and kill them instantly with an Anti-Tank round, which would have had limited ammo. That is just not done in warfare. (picture me continuing this rant, I won't waste your time.) Some soldiers have metal alergies which cause them to lose health whenever they are near metal. I won't even start on how many problems there are with that.   Nuetrals: There is a lot of down time between combat missions (like an actual military unit I suppose). This downtime is spent watching videos or clicking through visual novel type sections. Still a good story, but drags on a little.  Interesting selection of soldiers, each with a different voice actor (so far) and personality. Some have no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Some are perfect. There are also references to other games with the charcters (see Vice and Aika)  Conclusion: You decide weather you want this game or not. I liked it myself (except for those tanks taking out my snipers in one shot. NO I WILL NOT LET THAT GO, NOR TAKE MY ANTI-PSYCOTICS!!!1!!!1@!14253$!@%$#^)"
"It's a dieselpunk setting, with mixed WW1-interwar-early WW2 levels of development. They have superheavy tanks to put the Ratte to shame but flight is still in its infancy. Unfortunately, the storytelling ends up being typical JRPG fare and the of the game kills any chance at a grittier, more realistic approach to storytelling that could have been done. A big disappointment to me, and I felt the same way about Shadow Hearts, taking an awesome, dark steampunk setting and turning itto to the usual save-the-world quest, as if people won't want to play it otherwise."
"I plyed this game to death on PS3 years ago, but I find myself playing it all over again now that it's on Steam. The characters are just so enticing, the story so enthralling, that I can't seem to put it down."
"Great Game, fun tactics, Scouts OP"
Got arrested for drawing a fish. 10/10
An absolutely amazing JRPG. Arguably the best one I have ever played.
"If you like Tactical RPGs, and can appreciate the *very* Japanese style, you're in for an awesome game."
A real diamond in the rough. Unique art and gameplay. JRPG story with a lot of heart.  It's a PS3 cult classic and the PC port is great.
"This is a really enjoyable game with what appears so far to have a good story line. For gamers like me who have missed this title on the PS3, the gameplay is a hybrid of XCOM and Fire Emblem. The game progresses through cut scenes and you play the combat missions(which are extremely enjoyable), after the first couple of chapters you will gain access to the 'barracks' where the player can upgrade weapons and recruit new members etc. where the fun really begins! Well worth the price for anyone looking for a fun and challenging stategy game."

"I played this originally when it came out on PS3, as well as the second game on PSP. This series is by far one of the most innovative iterations of an SRPG and is tactically challenging, while being extremely fun. The story is interesting; the characters unique. The leveling system is also a lot of fun, as you level the class rather than the individual character. This means that you spend more time getting to know each characters strengths and weaknesses rather than trying to level up individual favorites. The graphics might not seem like much, but they are actually quite beautiful and done with a water color pallete in mind. Each character has a set amount of movement and actions, which can be increased through leveling. Items and weapons are created in the weapons development area. I personally find this game to be one of the best of last generation RPG's, and one of the best games of last generation consoles."
Chinese Cartoon World War 2 in which not Belgium fights off not Germany. Marina is best girl. 10/10
Tons of fun
"It was a great game on PS3, now it's even better on PC."
Made so many army waifus...I don't mind a little rough love now and then C:
great port from ps3. great story and mechanics love the world war 2 style
"Finish PS3 version and play World War Moe again now in 1080p and 144fps.  No rebalances, straight port from PS3.  Scout rushes and order abuse still works.  Can't even see the loading screen.  Can't even see the saving screen oh god is it broken, dayum digga, u save so fast.  Savescumming.  Why are you even savescumming?  Edy still best girl.  There is no VC2, do not bother.  11/10. Someone tell Sega and their marketing to not be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and put VC series on non-mobile and non-portable versions."
"A wonderful tale of love and bravery. As an RPG and strategy game enthusiast, this game provides the best of both worlds through its unique combat system and engaging story.  Valkyria Chronicles is an innovative and amazing game, and the PC port gives it the detail and resolution it deserves."
Great game!!! Feels just like when I was playing on the PS3 but better!!
"Even if you hate RPGs with a passion, or even SRPGs in particular, this game is unique enough and charming enough to be enjoyable as it does away with a lot of tedious grinding and other such common problems. The battle system is quite unique and the individuality of the potentials for each character, granting positive and negative effects is both strategically very fun and also makes you love the characters more. It brings a lot of dynamics to building your team and really makes you care if a key person dies in battle. The main cast cant die permanently but secondary characters can, though it isnt as much of a pain as other permadeath systems as you're given 3 turns to touch the fallen character with another character, who then calls a medic to save them.  It has a huge cast of really varied characters of all ages and walks of life, most of which are very lovable and funny with a couple being pointedly jerks to the extent of also being amusing. There are some truly epic set piece battles like nothing I've ever seen in a strategy game before, they're absolutely intimidating and overwhelming at first and give a fantastic sense of achievement when completed. It's dual audio but the dub is extremely high quality so you can feel absolutely safe to go with either option."

"Welkin wishes he were a bridge. No context needed, 11/10."
"Simply put, one of the finest strategy RPGs ever made, and certainly the finest of the last decade. Excellent story that illustrates the comraderie, politics and horrors of war better than most hollywood movies(yes, even with the anime character designs), and gameplay so engaging and satisfying that you'll never get tired of figuring out the puzzles that are the strategically minded levels in this game.  Easily a 10/10 in my book, and more than worth 20$ if you've never experienced this gem from the ps3, or if you've since lost your copy and don't feel like browsing around for a used copy."

"Pop pop pop, watching anime nazis drop.  It's a really fun game honestly. Fun, lots of hidden content.   Aiming has issues now and then if you are up close to an enemy and my save file mysteriously vanished but it's still fun to play. A lot of hours worth for the price."
"One of the most unique and fun strategy games ever, also anime artstyle 10/10"
A unique take on strategy with enough real time action to keep you on your toes. I already had this for the PS3 but wanted to have it for ease of use on my PC. Quite a steal for only $20 compared to the other shovelware that has come out recently. 9/10.
A fun take on a jrpg strategy game. I liked the artstyle and the gameplay
"Loved this game to death on the ps3 and certainly will enjoy it again on the PC. Great characters, great story, and very unique artstyle. The PC port comes with all DLC, and even the DLC themselves felt very well designed."
great port from ps3. great story and mechanics love the world war 2 style
Chinese Cartoon World War 2 in which not Belgium fights off not Germany. Marina is best girl. 10/10
Tons of fun
"It was a great game on PS3, now it's even better on PC."
Made so many army waifus...I don't mind a little rough love now and then C:

"WOW. This game totally surpassed my expectations.   - TANKS! - WW2esque/steampunk setting - Great character design, weapon design and tanks designs - The game graohics looks like it's on a painting and it works wonders.  - Very engaging story - Amazing strategy elements: units have traits (eg. hates the desert/loner) and different specialities (scout, lancer) - Really utilise cover, weapon range, weapon specialities, armor ratings, elevation etc as strategy elements - Enemies shoot you as you move. Cover became really valuable. - Great team battle system becase they can support each other as they attack - It's a JRPG  I can't think of any negatives  11/10 Can't get myself to play a different game at the moment"
"The absolute best strategy/rpg from the PS3 era is out on the PC at last. I loved this game on the PS3 and it is just as good now on the PC. The art style is great, the music matches the scenese perfectly. You owe it to yourself to play this game if you are a fan of strategy/rpg games. It even includes all the DLC from the PS3!!"
Im going to tell you now the port of this game is bad allowing only the most basic of feature needed to let it be played on a pc but the game itself is still more then good enough for me to recomend picking it up if you are a fan of either RPG or tactical strategy games. I have played through the game at least once a year for the last 4 years and havent gotten sick of it yet. The aesthetic is put together well and the combat is well polished. It is decent in length with each playthrough of mine lasting about 15-20 hours but i dont know how much the dlc adds
"Pros: Touches on issues not usualy examined in WW2 like games.  Well built combat mechanics Interesting story  Cons: (my personal observation, may be different for others) The computer seems to bend the rules of the game slightly because it's a computer. For example, very rarely does the computer fire a shot that will miss. A sniper will spam body shots until your unit dies. Out of the blue, a tank on the other side of the map will somehow get line of sight on one of your soldiers, get a perfect headshot and kill them instantly with an Anti-Tank round, which would have had limited ammo. That is just not done in warfare. (picture me continuing this rant, I won't waste your time.) Some soldiers have metal alergies which cause them to lose health whenever they are near metal. I won't even start on how many problems there are with that.   Nuetrals: There is a lot of down time between combat missions (like an actual military unit I suppose). This downtime is spent watching videos or clicking through visual novel type sections. Still a good story, but drags on a little.  Interesting selection of soldiers, each with a different voice actor (so far) and personality. Some have no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Some are perfect. There are also references to other games with the charcters (see Vice and Aika)  Conclusion: You decide weather you want this game or not. I liked it myself (except for those tanks taking out my snipers in one shot. NO I WILL NOT LET THAT GO, NOR TAKE MY ANTI-PSYCOTICS!!!1!!!1@!14253$!@%$#^)"
A really really good Japanimation game. Pretend your computer is a PS2/3 and step aboard!
"I will write a better review later on after playing some more of this, but since it is currently on sale, i wanted to write this for those interested but not 100% sure.  This game is a turn-based game in which you have limited amount of distances you can travel and thus you have to think like a strategist. Planning your route and plan of attack, is vital. Failure to do so, will result in either you losing because your soldier was a derp and ran out of energy to run to cover, or you simply losing comrades who will not be revived. It is tricky, but there are many ways to skin a cat, and for this, there are many ways to win the battle.   There are various classes of soldiers to use in battle, each with their own strengths and personalized weaknesses. There is ways to grind for exp and money, while it is never needed, it is good for things in general.    The Art style, is very unique looking and while it is not a 4k texture package with 60+fps and all of that modern stuff you hear, it is a nice change of pace and it honestly looks good, period. The outer white line that borders the video, can be odd at first but it gives off the effect of you being in the story.   Speaking of story, there is a nicely done story for this game which I am still learning about, but it sounds like one that has potential for a lot of good, and bad, things to happen. Also, the game has a 'episode' like feel to it. What I mean is that to play the game, you go to this book and 'Play' the episode. Doing this will either cause a video to play and can be skipped, or you will see a fe wshort clips that ends in a fight.    overall, it's a great buy, the price is cheap, and the game is amazing. Is it 10/10? I don't know yet. Maybe, maybe not, but for the current price, it IS worth it."
Excellent game. One of the best ports.
One of the best games I've ever played and I hope they put the other Valkyria games on the PC.
"Excelent game, can get frustrating at times when istep on a landmine :)"
"Valkyria is a game in the vein of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, at least at first glance, with turn-based combat that emphasizes cover as well as permadeath for your units. While XCOM focuses on a series of randomized missions, however, Valkyria has missions that are hand-crafted, with enemy positions and events all being pre-determined.   This means that every mission is highly linear, though also that it comes with its own unique challenges. Each mission feels almost like solving a puzzle, figuring out how to optimally utilizing your units, reloading a save if things go badly (and trust me, you will want to save, a lot, even if doing so takes a chunk of the tension away).  Each mission, or chapter, basically feels like an episode of an anime. You get a series of cutscenes elaborating on the plot, followed by a single battle containing some unique gimmick to master or overcome, like traversing an exposed desert with little cover (which conveniently enough has sandstorms obstructing vision at regular intervalls).  While the linear nature of the missions can be seen as a detriment, i found it enjoyable to have each new mission throw something new at me, approaching it more like a puzzle than a strategy game. The game also keeps this up for around 30 hours, so you are in for a lengthy experience, considering it is all linear story. This also means that the story is what drives the game forward. Thus, if a story about the harsh reality of war, viewed through a light anime-lens (which takes away a lot of the shock and horror you'd expect) does not sound appealing, then the basic gameplay might get dull in the long run. If you  do  like anime-style storytelling and turn-based combat, however, this is a game i will highly recommend, especially for the asking price (even more so during sales)."
This game is awesome! Not very far. I'm not very good at it but it's fun.
HD port of one of the best games ever released on PS3.   Just buy it! It's worth it. 10/10
"A successful merger of both Fire Emblem and Xcom types of gameplay, menus are a little janky but ignoring that it's absolute perfection."
Amazing! I love this game to its core.
"Having missed out on this game when it first came out (On account of not having a Playstation 3). I am blown away with the content. All I can say is this. If it sounds appealing to you, jump on it because it proves true on all it's promises. My biggest hope is this... That the other entries are also ported. I would buy them on the spot. I have not found myself so into a game, in such a long while. The story, gameplay, and art is all awe-inspiring."
"If you missed out on this wonderful game when it released on PS3 originally, you definitely should grab it here on team!  Apart for cutscenes that still run in 720p and some gameplay oddities on higher framerates, this is a very good port of the original and remains one of the best games I've played.  Highly recommended"
Solid port of a great PS3 game. More please Sega...
I can't stop playing this game. I played it on the ps3 and now on the pc. The main difference between the two is that on the pc there is virtualy no loading screens. The gameplay and story on this game are great. Thank you SEGA!
"I love this game on the PS3, so I decided to buy it. Now I can enjoy my favorite game on PC and tinker with the files to modify guns &gt;:3"
"Fantastic port of the ps3 game.  Valkyria Chronicles is a turn based rpg set in Europa, loosely based on Europe during the early years of World War II. It has very fun and fluid gameplay, a good amount of customizable squad options, and a very well done story narrative   A must for anyone who likes anime's,rpg's, and turn based strategy games"
"Absolutely wonderful game which should be a must have in every decent gamers library!  Played it on the PS3 before that and bought it for PC without hesitation. Great story, beautiful visuals and innovative gameplay. The battles play similar to XCOM: Enemy unknown and relies a lot on tactical thinking. If you're looking for a story driven game with good gameplay this is the game for you."
Game is amazing. Perfect blend of stratigizing and pure force. This game incorporates xcom mechanics with third person shooter ideas. Overall I think this game is great. But so I can't be compeletly bias I will write pros and cons. Pros: -Great story line. -Great characters and character development. -Combat can be puzzling and complex -If you do not enjoy the puzzling and complex idea. You can go guns blazing. -Customizable team ability to switch them out in middle of operation. -Able to upgrade and progess team you create. Cons: -In some cases glitches can be found. (Shooting at a wall even though the circle is not near the wall.) -Enemys being able to get nearly imposible shots off onto you. -No ability to save in middle of operation. (I had to give up progess in a operation because of time.)  Everything aside if you like civ 5. I would say this game may perplex you. If you play xcom this game will do more then delight you. If you like any third person shooter/turn based game if you don't play this game you are missing out. But that said if you do not like turn based games. Do not buy this game. If you do not enjoy third person games but can tolerate the aspect of turn base. I suggest to buy it. The game was worth the 20 dollars I spent on it and if it was 10 more dollars I would even buy it then.
"The year is 1935 and your nation is being invaded by an imperialistic superpower.  This game, it might have some cheesy dialogues, and the English voice acting doesn't win any medals, but this game has a good storyline telling of an alternate Europe where the second war for Europe just broke out. And the story tells like a real war. A war where your nation is the underdog. A war, were your soldiers have names, their own histories and they can die. Sometimes a death actually feels like a loss, not a statistic. I found myself going the extra length to help my wounded.   The easiest way to describe the gameplay would be to say it combines turn-based tactical movement with jrpg style characters and menues in between battles. The learning curve over the first four or five battles isn't bad, it lets you get to grips with the game mechanics and understand how the battles actually work. Learning is easy, mastery is hard. And perhaps that is my only itch with this game, its not simply challenging, it is hard. By chapter VI, without revealing the storyline, you better have grasped tactictical movement and management or your soldiers will suffer.  To summarize...  The Good: -Driving and well told storyline -Challenging gameplay -Well made learning curve -Decent research, leveling and upgrade mechanic -The troops are more than mere numbers and names -Rewarding victories, more so if you do well  The Bad: -MIght become too difficult for the novice -Poor English voices, but you can switch to Japanese with English subtitles -Potentially frustrating at times due to losses or loss of key character  The Neutral: -This is a ported game, limited saving options -Music and sound effects are ok, but nothing to write home about  Bottom Line:  -This a good game, not excellent, but good. 4 out of 6 on a die roll."
"This is honestly one of my absolute favorite games of all time. If you are a fan of turn-based strategy games, I would highly recommend giving this game a look. It offers a unique take on the genre with a combination of standard turn-based strategy and 3rd-person-shooter-esque gameplay, and it creates a beautiful world in which every single character (even non-story ones) has a unique personality and identity. The story is perhaps not the most revolutionary, but it is still compelling enough to keep the player interested until the end, and it creates a number of intriguing protagonists and antagonists. This is a game which may have flown under a number of gamers' radars when it came out on the PS3 in 2008, but it is more than worth a look for fans of strategy games. It's a fresh approach to the turn-based strategy genre and an overall beautiful game.   Story-wise, the game is fairly decent, although it admittedly isn't exactly on the level of a BioWare game. The game is set in a fictional version of Europe in a small nation called Gallia which is caught between two warring super-nations to the east and west. Gallia is a neutral nation, but as it holds great mineral wealth the eastern Empire one day invades. You'll be leading a regiment of the nation's militia forces in battle to defeat the Empire, who are rumored to have a near-invincible mythical being known as a 'Valkyria' on their side. There is heavy emphasis on the characters in the game, and although some of the character development is perhaps a bit predictable, the game does an excellent job of really bringing each character (even the minor, non-story ones) to life and giving them distinct personalities.   So, the concept of the game: your role is to carry out the actual battles between the militia and the Empire. Battles are turn-based and proceed by moving your units one-by-one throughout the battle field. Where this gets interesting is in what happens after you select a unit on the overview map. Once a unit is selected, the game changes into a 3rd-person shooter: you will be able to move the unit in a 3D environment and must avoid enemy fire while moving into position to execute an attack. During their turn, a unit will only be able to move a limited distance (represented as the resource 'AP'), and they will get one attack per move, during which you line up their actual shot yourself. This may seem slightly strange, but once you play the first few missions in the game it will all make perfect sense. It's a battle system which is fairly unique in the world of strategy games and is executed very well. Perhaps the only thing I'd criticise is the inability to see a preview of some enemy positions on the map when you are choosing which units to deploy before a mission, but that's far from a game-breaking flaw. The mouse-and-keyboard controls are more than serviceable, and the game also supports using a gamepad, which may feel slightly more natural, but is by no means necessary to enjoy the game.   Part of the fun of the game is in building your squad that you will be leading into battle. You can select from five classes of units in the game: scouts (high mobility but low power), shocktroopers (high offense but low mobility), lancers (anti-tank units), engineers (can resupply and disarm mines), and snipers (low mobility and defense but excellent range). You also have one tank in your squad, which you must keep alive at all costs (failing to do so causes a game over). Perma-death is a feature of the game (once a squad member dies, they're gone forever), so fans of Fire Emblem should feel right at home here.   The game becomes a bit like an RPG by allowing you to hand-pick the units to use in your squad and how to upgrade their equipment and provide experience. Each of these units will have unique inherent characteristics (called 'Potentials') which will activate during battle and either increase or decrease their combat capability in certain situations. For example, one unit may get improved attack when firing on a particular unit class, while another one might receive reduced defense when crouching behind sandbags, while still others may suffer a steady HP drain when in a sandy environment. These inherent qualities make you genuinely have to think when selecting the units to use in a mission, and they also do a very good job in bringing the characters to life and creating their own distinct identities even without them playing roles in the story. You can start to feel quite attached to the characters in your squad over the course of the game, particularly with the threat of perma-death looming in each engagement. You can also buy a number of upgrades for each unit class, including choosing different paths for weapons to be used by that class in battle. For instance, you can choose to equip one lancer unit with an anti-tank rocket, while another could use an anti-personnel mortar. Finally, when levelling up units in the squad, you level up entire classes at a time, which removes the need to babysit certain units to level them up (a la Fire Emblem).   In terms of graphics, the art is absolutely phenomenal. Everything looks like a painting in motion. This is one of the first games I've seen that manages to make war look beautiful. The soundtrack does a very good job of bringing the game's world to life, although some of the tracks can become slightly repetitive. Still, it shouldn't really be a cause for annoyance, since the music is still quite good (composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, composer of the music in the Final Fantasy Tactics Advance series and for FF XII).   Overall, the main campaign can take maybe 20-50 hours to complete, depending on how much time you spend customizing your squad and performing side missions for extra experience. For replay value, you are able to freely go back through the campaign missions after completing it once. There are also a number of side-missions (called 'Skirmishes') which you can complete on various difficulty levels. The higher difficulty levels for skirmishes are also quite genuinely challenging, and give you a real sense of accomplishment when you complete them.   So, my verdict. This game is a unique experience, and it's a very good strategy game which fully deserves your attention. If you are at all interested in turn-based strategy games, I completely suggest giving this game a try. I could not recommend this game more highly.   I'm so happy that it's come to Steam since it didn't really get enough exposure on the PS3. So, would I recommend buying this game? 100% YES."
"Set in a World War II-era conflict on the fictional continent of Europa, this tactical RPG features excellent gameplay, a wonderful story with a colorful cast of characters, beautiful graphics and a stunning soundtrack. Absolutely worth playing."
It's turn-based strategy with some RPGs elements set in anime fantasy WW2. What's not to love?
"Its a very fun, interesting, and challenging game. I recommend it to those who like Visual Novels and Tactic Games"
"Do NOT save DLC progress over your campaign saves!  One of my favorite games and I was overjoyed to see it on Steam. I did not hesitate to buy it and nor should you if you like Japanese RPGs. Good story and gameplay, perfect with an Xbox controller. Only problems I have had is the game minimizing infrequently. Some DLC missions should have been intergrated into the campaign since doing them does not contribute to your experience or funds in the campaign (DLCs are accessed from Extras in the main menu)."
"I am basing my review off the gameplay, I don't believe I have enough play time to judge the story line quite yet. Turn based action gameplay is fun, and very enjoyable within many games, but this game adds a third person shooter like feel to it making it all the better. Graphics are great, and the option to choose between English or Japanese voice acting is a nice little extra. All in all, from what I have played of this game so far I would recommend this game to my friends. Simply just for a new play style unlike other games I have played."
"This right here is a classic. It has absolutely stunning art direction and visuals, beautiful music, an interesting setting and story, a huge cast of characters, and it's all placed in a fun SRPG third-person shooter. And it plays even better on PC! It's seriously a really good port."
"The music alone get's me excited to play this game. It's simplistic combat system has an allure I can't quite place. Still, fan of the anime or not, this is a fun one that I suggest you do not pass on!"
This is thus far a seemless port to the PC. This title is amoung my top 5 games that I have played. The artwork is unique and adds a perfect asstetic to the telling of such an amazing story. I continue to recomend this game to anyone showing interest. Here's to hoping that they do the same with the 2nd and 3rd installments as well. The sales would surely speak for themselves!
"This is a port of the wonderful PS3 action strategy game. But this isn't just any old port. This is a real-deal PC port. You want 1080p@60fps? You got it. Want it even bigger? No problem!  OK, so settings aside, this game is really fun. It has engaging combat with memorable characters in a lore-rich (if not particularly original) story. This also includes all the DLC that was later released for the original PS3 title, which is a nice bonus.  I would say that the best experience comes from using a controller with the voice acting set to the original Japanese. This game is pretty damn Japanese, but it's bearable in part thanks to its sketchbook-style art and fun gameplay.  My one major gripe is that it is currently not possible to set any sort of anti-aliasing or anisotropic filtering. It's not a big deal, but it would be nice to help smooth out the now high detail edges. Additionally, major cinematics are still from the pre-rendered PS3 version which is a bit jarring when transitioning between gameplay and watching something.  In an ideal world, this game sells so well that HD ports are brought over of Valkyria Chronicles 2 (available only on PSP) and Valkyria Chronicles 3 (available only on PSP in Japan)."
"Nice Turn based strategy RPG , the story is noticeable, and the artwork &amp; voice act is amazing ! theres also a japan voice ver. in setting (which is good) cause most jrpg became lousy when the game dubbed to english and no setting for voice.  please port Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 to STEAM too ! definietly buy it!"
"Initially, I was impressed by the tactical depth of the battles and the funny writing. Soon however, I was blown away by the strategic possibilities.   This is a game that successfully incorporates some of the best parts of games like Fire Emblem, Advance Wars, and Final Fantasy Tactics in 3D. This is the game that Battalion Wars should have been.  Pros: Tactical and strategic depth Interesting characters Some of the best systems for pseudo-real-time strategy Japanese voices with optional English subtitles (Try it!) Challenging difficulty Upgrades visually reflected on character models, including the tank(s) Comic-book art style complete with 'ratatat' machine gun sounds and 'vroom' tank noises represented by colorful text.  Cons: Some politically incorrect characters Only a few classes Lack of individual unit customization   Caveat: I haven't finished the game yet. "
10/10   Had it and came incredibly close to beating the PS3 version years ago. More than willing to do it all again on this version. Runs smooth and had Steam Cheevos.   One of the best SRPGs I've ever played.   Let Sega know there's a market for this great series by buying up this version!
"I was really on the fence about buying this game, but now that I have played it I understand why my friends keep talking about it. The storyline is enthralling, which would be enough to make it worth the meager 20 dollars required. But then the strategy makes it so much better. Its like a telltale game mixed with great strategy. I did not want to be wasteful and buy a game I would never play, and I would say this game was well worth the money. It does not have rediculous graphic requirements, nor should it. If you want a story driven strategy that is 10/10 great then you found it. Even if you are just looking around for any game then this one might turn you on to another genre entirely. 10/10 love it, never had a game move me this much, not even The Walking Dead(the Telltale series)."
The animation detail (chalk and stone or w/e it's called) it's really awesome for something that's this old to be of a port. I reccomend getting it ASAP just in case Sega brings over the rest of the series. Overall I think they did a fine job I'm loving every moment of it. I wished JRPGs were this unique and not following the basic turn-based layout. 10/10!
"Let not its anime style deceive you , Valkyria Chronicles is a great game and have a great cinematic experience. I had the PS3 game and it remains one of my all time favourites. Glad SEGA sega decided to release this game on Steam. Well play SEGA."
"Great Game, works just as well on the pc. Works with DS3 Tool and a PS3 controller perfectly."
"Easily one of THE best porting jobs I've seen on PC in a long time.  VC can be a challenging game (one of the earlier missions is obscenely difficult for where it is, but once you get past that it seems fine). If you've played Frozen Synapse you'll have a vague idea of how movement/combat works, but without the rewind mechanism - so it's important to get things right first try, because there might not be a second chance. With a variety of troop types and other mechanisms in play, the selection of your squad can mean the difference between victory and defeat, so the game has you on your toes from the start - and it's as unfair to you as it is the AI! The trick is in minimising the effects of the game's quirky approach to turn-based combat.  It also has a reasonably interesting story, at least as far as this type of game goes, so that helps it be fun."
Favorite game on the last generation of consoles and favorite overall of the last 5 years.
"Created by the team that made Skies of Arcadia, Valkyria Chronicles is a very unique SRPG that invokes the kind of creative spirit that was present at Sega during the years of the Dreamcast. The art style is like a drawing that has come to life and here on PC it is better than ever running at 4k really shows how beautiful the graphics are. It will no doubt endure long after all of today’s realistic style games start to look dated. The soundtrack by Hitoshi Sakimoto is just perfect.   The game itself is a really interesting hybrid of turn based commands, real time movement/aiming, character management and a jrpg story. Squad members in the militia all have their own likes and dislikes that make them unique personalities (Vyse and Aika are among them) and which also have game-play repercussions in battle. In addition to this if a character dies they are gone for good which makes each encounter more tense and rewarding as you fight to keep every person from Gallia alive.  The game originally released on the ps3 during 2008, unfortunately it was criminally overlooked despite being a critical success it was a commercial failure. The result was that the sequel moved to the Sony psp and the 3rd game? It was never released outside of Japan. Luckily the game is getting a 2nd chance here and it is a perfect fit for PC considering the success of things like Enemy Unknown.  So if you like titles such as Xcom, Fire emblem, Final fantasy tactics or of-course Skies or Arcadia, then Valkyria Chronicles is the game for you."
"Running very smooth in my old computer. i have been played this game in ps3 , and play VC2 in psp. decent strategy games , hope VC 2 and VC 3 will out to PC."
"A wonderful game on the Playstation 3, and a top quality port for lucky PC gamers. Technically the game runs very well even on less powerful hardware, has very good control options, and despite the games age still looks as lovely today as it did years back on PS3. It also has a suprising storyline and tackles some rather dark themes.   A strategy game that is unique in style and also in gameplay. It's fun, challenging and a bargain at the price. Well recommended."
square please take notes on how to properly port a game to pc
If you like predictable anime tropes and turn-based strategy this game delivers on both fronts
"Still worth playing through since its release. Whilst not *as* good as the PlayStation 3 version in terms of control-fluidity, it is better than I had dared hope for a port. Definitely recommended for everyone from anime-fans to strategists. Valkyria Chronicles is a uniqe experience that I keep coming back for year after year."
"I loved this game before, and it is just as I expected on the PC. The art style is great, the gameplay is one of my favorites of all time, and the added achievements are a great bonus."
"I'm not going to do a full review because I think a lot of people already covered the main points.  Simply put, this game is amazing for a £15 game. Definitely worth getting.  I would like to correct someone else's review...  They complained about the lack of in mission saves.  But you CAN save the game at any point on the map screen during missions. You could, if you wanted, save scum by doing so.  There are other ways to break the game such as getting the Ruhm weapon (a sniper heavy machine gun, basically) from the DLC or using certain combinations of orders to become essentially invincible. It's pretty much up to you to make sure you play in a way so that you will enjoy the game.  "
"This is honestly one of my absolute favorite games of all time. If you are a fan of turn-based strategy games, I would highly recommend giving this game a look. It offers a unique take on the genre with a combination of standard turn-based strategy and 3rd-person-shooter-esque gameplay, and it creates a beautiful world in which every single character (even non-story ones) has a unique personality and identity. The story is perhaps not the most revolutionary, but it is still compelling enough to keep the player interested until the end, and it creates a number of intriguing protagonists and antagonists. This is a game which may have flown under a number of gamers' radars when it came out on the PS3 in 2008, but it is more than worth a look for fans of strategy games. It's a fresh approach to the turn-based strategy genre and an overall beautiful game.   Story-wise, the game is fairly decent, although it admittedly isn't exactly on the level of a BioWare game. The game is set in a fictional version of Europe in a small nation called Gallia which is caught between two warring super-nations to the east and west. Gallia is a neutral nation, but as it holds great mineral wealth the eastern Empire one day invades. You'll be leading a regiment of the nation's militia forces in battle to defeat the Empire, who are rumored to have a near-invincible mythical being known as a 'Valkyria' on their side. There is heavy emphasis on the characters in the game, and although some of the character development is perhaps a bit predictable, the game does an excellent job of really bringing each character (even the minor, non-story ones) to life and giving them distinct personalities.   So, the concept of the game: your role is to carry out the actual battles between the militia and the Empire. Battles are turn-based and proceed by moving your units one-by-one throughout the battle field. Where this gets interesting is in what happens after you select a unit on the overview map. Once a unit is selected, the game changes into a 3rd-person shooter: you will be able to move the unit in a 3D environment and must avoid enemy fire while moving into position to execute an attack. During their turn, a unit will only be able to move a limited distance (represented as the resource 'AP'), and they will get one attack per move, during which you line up their actual shot yourself. This may seem slightly strange, but once you play the first few missions in the game it will all make perfect sense. It's a battle system which is fairly unique in the world of strategy games and is executed very well. Perhaps the only thing I'd criticise is the inability to see a preview of some enemy positions on the map when you are choosing which units to deploy before a mission, but that's far from a game-breaking flaw. The mouse-and-keyboard controls are more than serviceable, and the game also supports using a gamepad, which may feel slightly more natural, but is by no means necessary to enjoy the game.   Part of the fun of the game is in building your squad that you will be leading into battle. You can select from five classes of units in the game: scouts (high mobility but low power), shocktroopers (high offense but low mobility), lancers (anti-tank units), engineers (can resupply and disarm mines), and snipers (low mobility and defense but excellent range). You also have one tank in your squad, which you must keep alive at all costs (failing to do so causes a game over). Perma-death is a feature of the game (once a squad member dies, they're gone forever), so fans of Fire Emblem should feel right at home here.   The game becomes a bit like an RPG by allowing you to hand-pick the units to use in your squad and how to upgrade their equipment and provide experience. Each of these units will have unique inherent characteristics (called 'Potentials') which will activate during battle and either increase or decrease their combat capability in certain situations. For example, one unit may get improved attack when firing on a particular unit class, while another one might receive reduced defense when crouching behind sandbags, while still others may suffer a steady HP drain when in a sandy environment. These inherent qualities make you genuinely have to think when selecting the units to use in a mission, and they also do a very good job in bringing the characters to life and creating their own distinct identities even without them playing roles in the story. You can start to feel quite attached to the characters in your squad over the course of the game, particularly with the threat of perma-death looming in each engagement. You can also buy a number of upgrades for each unit class, including choosing different paths for weapons to be used by that class in battle. For instance, you can choose to equip one lancer unit with an anti-tank rocket, while another could use an anti-personnel mortar. Finally, when levelling up units in the squad, you level up entire classes at a time, which removes the need to babysit certain units to level them up (a la Fire Emblem).   In terms of graphics, the art is absolutely phenomenal. Everything looks like a painting in motion. This is one of the first games I've seen that manages to make war look beautiful. The soundtrack does a very good job of bringing the game's world to life, although some of the tracks can become slightly repetitive. Still, it shouldn't really be a cause for annoyance, since the music is still quite good (composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, composer of the music in the Final Fantasy Tactics Advance series and for FF XII).   Overall, the main campaign can take maybe 20-50 hours to complete, depending on how much time you spend customizing your squad and performing side missions for extra experience. For replay value, you are able to freely go back through the campaign missions after completing it once. There are also a number of side-missions (called 'Skirmishes') which you can complete on various difficulty levels. The higher difficulty levels for skirmishes are also quite genuinely challenging, and give you a real sense of accomplishment when you complete them.   So, my verdict. This game is a unique experience, and it's a very good strategy game which fully deserves your attention. If you are at all interested in turn-based strategy games, I completely suggest giving this game a try. I could not recommend this game more highly.   I'm so happy that it's come to Steam since it didn't really get enough exposure on the PS3. So, would I recommend buying this game? 100% YES."
"Set in a World War II-era conflict on the fictional continent of Europa, this tactical RPG features excellent gameplay, a wonderful story with a colorful cast of characters, beautiful graphics and a stunning soundtrack. Absolutely worth playing."
It's turn-based strategy with some RPGs elements set in anime fantasy WW2. What's not to love?
"Its a very fun, interesting, and challenging game. I recommend it to those who like Visual Novels and Tactic Games"
"Do NOT save DLC progress over your campaign saves!  One of my favorite games and I was overjoyed to see it on Steam. I did not hesitate to buy it and nor should you if you like Japanese RPGs. Good story and gameplay, perfect with an Xbox controller. Only problems I have had is the game minimizing infrequently. Some DLC missions should have been intergrated into the campaign since doing them does not contribute to your experience or funds in the campaign (DLCs are accessed from Extras in the main menu)."
"I am basing my review off the gameplay, I don't believe I have enough play time to judge the story line quite yet. Turn based action gameplay is fun, and very enjoyable within many games, but this game adds a third person shooter like feel to it making it all the better. Graphics are great, and the option to choose between English or Japanese voice acting is a nice little extra. All in all, from what I have played of this game so far I would recommend this game to my friends. Simply just for a new play style unlike other games I have played."
"This right here is a classic. It has absolutely stunning art direction and visuals, beautiful music, an interesting setting and story, a huge cast of characters, and it's all placed in a fun SRPG third-person shooter. And it plays even better on PC! It's seriously a really good port."
"The music alone get's me excited to play this game. It's simplistic combat system has an allure I can't quite place. Still, fan of the anime or not, this is a fun one that I suggest you do not pass on!"
This is thus far a seemless port to the PC. This title is amoung my top 5 games that I have played. The artwork is unique and adds a perfect asstetic to the telling of such an amazing story. I continue to recomend this game to anyone showing interest. Here's to hoping that they do the same with the 2nd and 3rd installments as well. The sales would surely speak for themselves!
"This is a port of the wonderful PS3 action strategy game. But this isn't just any old port. This is a real-deal PC port. You want 1080p@60fps? You got it. Want it even bigger? No problem!  OK, so settings aside, this game is really fun. It has engaging combat with memorable characters in a lore-rich (if not particularly original) story. This also includes all the DLC that was later released for the original PS3 title, which is a nice bonus.  I would say that the best experience comes from using a controller with the voice acting set to the original Japanese. This game is pretty damn Japanese, but it's bearable in part thanks to its sketchbook-style art and fun gameplay.  My one major gripe is that it is currently not possible to set any sort of anti-aliasing or anisotropic filtering. It's not a big deal, but it would be nice to help smooth out the now high detail edges. Additionally, major cinematics are still from the pre-rendered PS3 version which is a bit jarring when transitioning between gameplay and watching something.  In an ideal world, this game sells so well that HD ports are brought over of Valkyria Chronicles 2 (available only on PSP) and Valkyria Chronicles 3 (available only on PSP in Japan)."
"This game is fantastic. I'm not a huge fan of anime but the art style won me over with it's steam-punk ish look. The game does a great job showing that you are not leading faceless and disposable soldiers but individuals who all have their own personalities and traits as well as written bios if you want to learn all you can about every character. The game also is supposed to pay hommage to both the German and Allied sides of WWII and both sides are humanized without removing some of the barbaric things both sides did to each other (there is a mission where you liberate a concentration camp, just as an example). The gameplay is a mix of turn based and real time where you position your soldiers then aim their weapons and while you are doing anything but aiming, enemies can shoot you and vice versa.   tl;dr get it because it does a good job with the history, has good characters, there's an option to enable Japanese language with English subtitles, and the gameplay is unique. I can't recommend this game enough."
I honestly felt this game would be terrible. My assumption were it was another knock off game made to profit off anime fans. Rather surprisingly the game and features are executed beyond my expectation. It is a strategy game that is turned based like x-com but there is more to it than just what x-com brought. So far so good unfortuneately remember to manually save as there is no auto-save.   I like the game. Alot of customization and upgrading. It does feel like losing team members is a rare occurence as long as you keep them in pairs.
"This is THE game that tempted me to buy a PS3 and I never dared hope it would be ported to Windows. Years later I find myself streaming it from a Windows PC to a TV via a NUC running Steam for Linux and playing the game using an Xbox controller with a chinese rip-off wireless receiver -- the mind boggles. Many thanks to Valve, the Linux kernel team and, dare I say it, Sega!  This is a fantastic port of an absolutely wonderful game. The pseudo turned based combat is just brilliant and the artwork stunning. The story has plenty of pathos, balanced by cooky humour. If you like strat, you really must buy this game."
"This is a wonderfully unique game with a fantastic art style.  I was instantly hooked after playing the demo on the PS3, so I bought it for the console.  Lent the game to a friend who was also hooked and bought his own copy.  Lent the game to someone else I couldn't remember and effectively lost the disc.  Bought another used copy for the PS3 so I could keep playing.  PS3 died.  Tore apart my PS3 and repaired it so I could play this game again.  PS3 died again.  Got a professional repair job.  Played Valkyria Chronicles for 5 more hours before the console kicked the bucket again.  Now it's out on PC, and I have purchased yet another copy. This time, I hope the enduring PC platform will finally let me finish this brilliant, fantastic game. When I first fired it up on PC and started on my first mission, I was instantly hooked yet again. This game is right up there with Final Fantasy Tactics as a game that I will keep purchasing on every platform it gets released on, and that I can keep playing over and over.  $20 is a great price. I would have paid more. I consider it a discount since this is my 3rd purchase of the title. It was a no-brainer for me, and after 2 play sessions of getting reacquainted with the game, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase."
"VC veteran here. In a time where most Japanese games are poorly ported to PC, Valkyria Chronicles breaks that curse. After the first couple missions, the PC control layout is easy to get used to. For those new players interested in trying this out; I highly recommend this for the story, art, and great gameplay.  Pro's: -Instantaneous saving. -All DLC comes with the main game.  Con -Tank control by mouse is glitchy, so use only the keyboard for tank combat. -There's no clear way to get back to video/optimization settings (but I'm happy with the graphics thus far)."
I love this game. The port to PC was done very well. I have no complaints.
"Pretty fun turn-based strategy game with lots of text to read about your characters, the world and the equipment they're using. The story is engaging, though the characters range from one-dimensional to super interesting. The 'difficulty' in missions has mostly to do with incomplete information, where enemies will surprise you with set ambushes, unexpected environmental effects and other such nonsense that will likely lose you battles, a lot like the Fire Emblem series. Similarly, once you know about them, the battles are usually fairly simple. If the game gave you a better sense of what was dangerous and give you the option of taking risks instead of springing deadly effects on you, the fighting might be more interesting. Nonetheless, worth a try."
"Graphics looks amazing, gameplay is immersive and intensive. plot is rich and well developed. One of the best turn-based strategy RPGs out there for PCs. 10/10 would buy again and looking forward to the release of VC2 on PC."
it a great game that take out all the boring parts of a strategy game (and is pretty fast for a strategy game) it also has an anime which sort of lead to my buy this game.
"Damn playing this game is making me forgot about time! so interesting with storyline, music, art, gameplay, EVERYTHING!!! worth to buy!! Finished the game, watched the anime, the story complete each other"
"I love it. I never heard of it, let alone played the console version. Thanks for the rather quality port. It transitions rather well, other than a few awkward control issues using keyboard mouse.  Tactical RPG, WW1-2 era technology, unique (to me) combat system. Mind blowing art. A bit wordy on cinematics, but you can skip them, or enjoy them. I've found they aren't tedious (at least the first time through)."
"Best Story driven Strategy game todate i'm very happy they have released this on Steam There are a lot of games that while contemporary are regarded as 'classic' or 'masterpieces', but don't hold up well when you go back to them years later. Their luster fades, their novelty no longer feels like anything more than a cheap gimmick, and modern successors do what they did better. Valkyria Chronicles is not one of these games.  Every bit as fresh today as it was in 2008, VC is perhaps the most singularly inspired tactical RPG to ever come into existance, seemingly arising out of nowhere with wholly unique gameplay, a fully realized setting full of fantastic worldbuilding, and a cast of characters as memorable as they are lovable.  If you love strategy games, RPGs, or just games that are truly original, you owe it to yourself to experience one of the best games ever made."
"Great 'old school' style turn based JRPG strategy game! Takes me back to my PS2 and Dreamcast days!  I have never played this game before on PS3, but I have have always been a fan of JRPG type games. So when I found out that sega was going to port this game over to PC I got pretty excited because I had heard good things about this game when it came out for PS3.  I'm not very far into the game, but so far the game is showing great promise. I love the way the game is illustrated. Meaning that the animated scenes kind of look like a painting(in my opinion). Now the animated scenes are not what I would call 'current gen' graphics. I would assume this is because of the amount of work that would have to go into rerendering all of the animated scenes (and there are alot of them) would simply not be worth the effort. While these scenes look 'old' it simply does not bother me. The rest of the game looks very nice and has obviously been updated. I even went as far as to tinker with it a little bit with sweet fx mixed in to increase the saturation and the sharpness. Although with this game I didn't find myself wanting to turn up the saturation much because this game looks good in my opinion being somewhat 'washed out'  The controls for the game do take a little bit to get used to. It is only because the mouse cannot be used in the menu's. Once you get used to it though it really is not bad at all and honestly the way the game is set up it would actually be harder to get around the menu's with a mouse in my opinion. While you cannot use the mouse in the menu's it can be used while in combat which is huge, because at first I tried using the keyboard to aim and it was way to touchy to aim efficiently.   The story so far is interesting, but I cannot elaborate on it too muchon it, again because I am not that far into the game. It has the typical JRPG type feel and it is noticable in some of the dialogue, but in all honesty I have really missed it as of late being on the PC and not have owned a console since the PS2.  I would definitaly reccomend this game to anyone who likes JRPG's and turn based strategy type games!  Also, not sure if anyone else knows about it or recognizes her or not, but Aika from Skies of Arcadia is in it! When I found her in the recruit list I got pretty excited! Skies of Arcadia was and still is one of my favorite JRPG's of all time! Now i just need to wait and see Vyse!... I need to dig out my dreamcast and play that again."
"A good port of an old PS3 game. Strategy with a tiny bit of TPS mixed in. Anime as hell, but not too much so. A definite buy."
"Great port of one of the best PS3 game ever made.  With a good plot, interesting characters and varied gameplay it gives an experience unlike any other game you have ever played.  A must play for any JRPG and/or strategy game fan."
"Amazing game. If you like turn-based strategy shooters (Hogs of War, anyone?), this is a must-buy. I already had this on PS3 before it was released on Steam. Did not regret buying it twice. PC version comes with all DLC included. It's a great port that runs very smoothly. Just keep in mind that it's best played with a controller."
"Great game, decent port from PS3."
"Loved this game on console. Had to get it again for my good o' PC.  -Graphics wise, about the same as the console version. Would've been nice to have a graphics boost, but then again there is a limit to what cel shading can do. (Then again, I am using a Samsung 60'' HD tv as a computer monitor) -It's nice that you get all the DLCs with this version of the game. -Loads insanely fast on my rig (Win7 64x, i7 3.4ghz, 16g ram)  A note to Sega - Please release 2 and 3 also. I'd buy it in a heartbeat.  Side note: Low game time, does not really mean low game time. I like to play games in offline mode and really have no need for achievements."
"This game is seriously underappreciated, the story line is solid, the gameplay is solid, and overall feels like a classic strategy rpg"
If you like predictable anime tropes and turn-based strategy this game delivers on both fronts
"Still worth playing through since its release. Whilst not *as* good as the PlayStation 3 version in terms of control-fluidity, it is better than I had dared hope for a port. Definitely recommended for everyone from anime-fans to strategists. Valkyria Chronicles is a uniqe experience that I keep coming back for year after year."
"I loved this game before, and it is just as I expected on the PC. The art style is great, the gameplay is one of my favorites of all time, and the added achievements are a great bonus."

A great game for turn-based rpg fans.
"I really enjoyed this game. It's a Strategy RPG with Third Person shooter elements thrown into the mix, think XCOM: Enemy Unknown but with manual aiming. The gameplay is fun and intuitive, and the maps are both unique and challenging. The game doesn't have many random factors; the success or failure of a mission largely depends on your positioning, aiming and movement. Your success or failure of a mission isn't really influenced by the RNG at all, which makes this game fair challenge-wise. There's also a quicksave option in the middle of missions, where you can save at any time during the mission and revert back to the save whenever you feel like it. It makes the game much more convienient to play through, as you can go back to an earlier point in the map and try out new strategies without having to play through all of it again.  The story is pretty nice, although I find that it's rather cliched and has small lapses in logic at some points. The cast of the game is generally likeable, but what I find nice about the game is that every character in your squad has a unique personality. Your squad members all have their own little quirks and habits, and it's reflected in their skillset and profiles. For example, one of your squad members is a masochist, and may get a stat boost if he falls below half health. There's also another member who is a pacifist that baulks at the idea of killing, and can't move after performing an attack. More often than not, I find myself picking a character with a sub-par skillset because I like their personality.   I'd strongly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy-RPGs or RPGs in general. It's really cheap as well, less than a third of the price of a normal AAA release. To sum up, it's a great game, a great port, and a must-buy for anyone that enjoys this genre."
"Valkyria Chronicles is one of my favorite games of all time. I would strongly suggest it to anyone who enjoys JRPGs or tactical strategy.  You get to handpick the members of your squad from a well-sized list of recruits and you can equip them with different guns and upgrade the guns as well. 5 types of soldiers, and it's your choice whether you want to have a balanced force on the battlefield or if you want to spam shocktroopers. You also have a really badass tank you can roll around and obliterate your enemies with.  The game has a very good plot and I was personally touched by the story. You will love the characters by the end of this. I would give it a 9/10 in gameplay(the only reason I'm not giving it a 10 is because I do feel that they could've done a little more on the customization side, perhaps by allowing you to create-a-recruit and also sometimes the AI is a little dumb and will sprint into your intercepting fire, killing themselves like morons), and a 10/10 in the story."
One of the best reasons to own a PS3 is now on PC
"Wonderfull. Play it with HiRes textures, HiRes Icon, PS button, 4K Downsampling with GeDosato and SGSSAA. So beautifull, and gives more experience than when I played on my PS3 years ago. Love It. Great Price too."
"Running very smooth in my old computer. i have been played this game in ps3 , and play VC2 in psp. decent strategy games , hope VC 2 and VC 3 will out to PC."
"A wonderful game on the Playstation 3, and a top quality port for lucky PC gamers. Technically the game runs very well even on less powerful hardware, has very good control options, and despite the games age still looks as lovely today as it did years back on PS3. It also has a suprising storyline and tackles some rather dark themes.   A strategy game that is unique in style and also in gameplay. It's fun, challenging and a bargain at the price. Well recommended."

A great game for turn-based rpg fans.
"Even if you hate RPGs with a passion, or even SRPGs in particular, this game is unique enough and charming enough to be enjoyable as it does away with a lot of tedious grinding and other such common problems. The battle system is quite unique and the individuality of the potentials for each character, granting positive and negative effects is both strategically very fun and also makes you love the characters more. It brings a lot of dynamics to building your team and really makes you care if a key person dies in battle. The main cast cant die permanently but secondary characters can, though it isnt as much of a pain as other permadeath systems as you're given 3 turns to touch the fallen character with another character, who then calls a medic to save them.  It has a huge cast of really varied characters of all ages and walks of life, most of which are very lovable and funny with a couple being pointedly jerks to the extent of also being amusing. There are some truly epic set piece battles like nothing I've ever seen in a strategy game before, they're absolutely intimidating and overwhelming at first and give a fantastic sense of achievement when completed. It's dual audio but the dub is extremely high quality so you can feel absolutely safe to go with either option."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a game that didn't recieve nearly as much notoriety as it should when it came out on PS3. It features a brilliant combat system that is a ton of fun to work out strategies for, and the story does an excellent job in supporting it. If you are looking for a strategy game to scratch an itch of that sort, Valkyria Chronicles should be right up your alley.  Now in terms of the port to PC. Given its a Japanese company (whoes track record for PC hasn't been very good) porting, its far better than I expected or hoped. The game supports resolutions up to 4k (I'm running on 1600x900) and you can either set the game to 30fps or your monitors refresh rate. It looks excellent running at a buttery smooth 60fps, and from what I understand it works just as well at 120 fps. The keys are fully rebindable to boot. However, options don't stretch much further beyond that. And just a note, the pre-rendered cutscenes are in 720p so you will get jagged edges on other resolutions.  Besides the resolution you're stuck with the graphical fidelity you've been given (which is extremely pretty), although that shouldn't be too much of an issue. The game was originally running on a PS3 and doesn't approach intensive in the performance department. But as always, make sure you can run it before buying the bloody thing.  The port isn't perfect, but its serviceable, and in terms of performance and the included DLC, is objectively better than the PS3 version. If you missed out on it the first time, or are looking for an excuse to experience the game again, get it. Its an absolute bargain, and will provide a good amount of fun."
"If you missed out on this wonderful game when it released on PS3 originally, you definitely should grab it here on team!  Apart for cutscenes that still run in 720p and some gameplay oddities on higher framerates, this is a very good port of the original and remains one of the best games I've played.  Highly recommended"
exquisite game with a huge amount of heart and charm. it's rate to find a title that is as endearing as this one
Solid port of a great PS3 game. More please Sega...
I can't stop playing this game. I played it on the ps3 and now on the pc. The main difference between the two is that on the pc there is virtualy no loading screens. The gameplay and story on this game are great. Thank you SEGA!
"I love this game on the PS3, so I decided to buy it. Now I can enjoy my favorite game on PC and tinker with the files to modify guns &gt;:3"
"Fantastic port of the ps3 game.  Valkyria Chronicles is a turn based rpg set in Europa, loosely based on Europe during the early years of World War II. It has very fun and fluid gameplay, a good amount of customizable squad options, and a very well done story narrative   A must for anyone who likes anime's,rpg's, and turn based strategy games"
"I got the Valkyria Chronicles manga books, didn't even knew it was from a game ...  I have not finished yet the game but ...  - Manga style - Turn based combat RPG - So far so good story - Awesome cutscenes with some funny/badass situation - Japanese full audio with english subtitles - Customizable squad members and gear - TANKS ! - WAIFUS !!!  Go and get it ! :D"
"wow fist time i saw this game i was like yeap that seal the deal for me getting a ps3 and was hoping it would come to pc, but now it here and it great love it 9/10"
A unique combination of SRPG and TPS. Very fun and engaging combat with a great story that is very much WW2-inspired.
"It took me a few mins to get over the menu being navigated by keyboard. The soundtracks and story line will definitely suck you in especially with the situation between Russia and Ukraine nowadays.  For those who haven't played the game on PS3 before, this game is a hybrid between turned-based strategy and FPS. While it's your turn, the enemy will stay where they are and start shooting at you, so find cover! Once it's their turn, it will be vice versa. So it matters where you place your units during the fight."
I honestly felt this game would be terrible. My assumption were it was another knock off game made to profit off anime fans.

"This is THE game that tempted me to buy a PS3 and I never dared hope it would be ported to Windows. Years later I find myself streaming it from a Windows PC to a TV via a NUC running Steam for Linux and playing the game using an Xbox controller with a chinese rip-off wireless receiver -- the mind boggles. Many thanks to Valve, the Linux kernel team and, dare I say it, Sega!  This is a fantastic port of an absolutely wonderful game. The pseudo turned based combat is just brilliant and the artwork stunning. The story has plenty of pathos, balanced by cooky humour. If you like strat, you really must buy this game."
"This is a wonderfully unique game with a fantastic art style.  I was instantly hooked after playing the demo on the PS3, so I bought it for the console.  Lent the game to a friend who was also hooked and bought his own copy.  Lent the game to someone else I couldn't remember and effectively lost the disc.  Bought another used copy for the PS3 so I could keep playing.  PS3 died.  Tore apart my PS3 and repaired it so I could play this game again.  PS3 died again.  Got a professional repair job.  Played Valkyria Chronicles for 5 more hours before the console kicked the bucket again.  Now it's out on PC, and I have purchased yet another copy. This time, I hope the enduring PC platform will finally let me finish this brilliant, fantastic game. When I first fired it up on PC and started on my first mission, I was instantly hooked yet again. This game is right up there with Final Fantasy Tactics as a game that I will keep purchasing on every platform it gets released on, and that I can keep playing over and over.  $20 is a great price. I would have paid more. I consider it a discount since this is my 3rd purchase of the title. It was a no-brainer for me, and after 2 play sessions of getting reacquainted with the game, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase."
"VC veteran here. In a time where most Japanese games are poorly ported to PC, Valkyria Chronicles breaks that curse. After the first couple missions, the PC control layout is easy to get used to. For those new players interested in trying this out; I highly recommend this for the story, art, and great gameplay.  Pro's: -Instantaneous saving. -All DLC comes with the main game.  Con -Tank control by mouse is glitchy, so use only the keyboard for tank combat. -There's no clear way to get back to video/optimization settings (but I'm happy with the graphics thus far)."
I love this game. The port to PC was done very well. I have no complaints.
"Pretty fun turn-based strategy game with lots of text to read about your characters, the world and the equipment they're using. The story is engaging, though the characters range from one-dimensional to super interesting. The 'difficulty' in missions has mostly to do with incomplete information, where enemies will surprise you with set ambushes, unexpected environmental effects and other such nonsense that will likely lose you battles, a lot like the Fire Emblem series. Similarly, once you know about them, the battles are usually fairly simple. If the game gave you a better sense of what was dangerous and give you the option of taking risks instead of springing deadly effects on you, the fighting might be more interesting. Nonetheless, worth a try."
"Great game.  &gt;Obviously beautiful artstyle and presentation.  &gt;Unique take on gameplay that proposes a blend of third-person shooter and turn-based strategy.  &gt;Awesome soundtrack; one of the few games where I actively go on YouTube out of the game to listen to the music. &gt;Compelling story, even if it has it's fair share of tropes and cliches (but those aren't inherently bad; the people ♥♥♥♥♥ing about cliches are critics. I encourage them to write a 100% original and revolutionary story).    As for the cons: &gt;An almost game-breaking bug in a mission where you have to scale a wall to destroy mounted cannons, there are ladders that you have to climb and the ones closest to the cannons make you fall through the map when you climb to the top. Thank god the ones further out work. Still annoying. &gt;Besides the few set locations where you can crouch behind sandbags and in trenches, and going prone in grass, there isn't really a cover system. This stands out more in the city missions where, in other games where you can take cover around corners, is non-existent in this game. Makes me wonder why people compare it to XCOM in this regard. &gt;Units don't really interact or support each other in any tangible way aside from either: A: Support resupplying other units with ammo as you walk near them, which refills after the enemy takes their turn anyway. B: Having the capacity to heal other units, but again every unit is capable of healing itself just as efficiently C: Firing their guns at the target you're shooting at if you're standing close enough to them. Some units have different relationships with others, such as being friends with or being racist against, which affects certain attributes when in close proximity.  And the biggest con in my eyes, and I'm sure in others' as well, is the broken beyond belief mission-ranking system that prioritizes sheer speed over anything else. This encourages the meta Scout rush strategy over any other strategy in any mission that requires the capture of the enemy base, which is a good 70%~ of the missions in-game minus a few huge story missions. I'm sure the devs didn't intend for gameplay to turn out this way, and if you play the game disregarding the scoring, it's extremely enjoyable. Unfortunately, the scoring also affects how much money and XP you earn to allocate towards troops and equipment, and missions are non-repeatable/non-radiant (which means no grinding), so it's sort of necessary if you want to get to the end-game weapons before New Game +.   I guess the S rank stands for Sonic, considering both games are made by the same dev. The same dev that's autistic when it comes to speed.  Regardless of how elaborate I was in my explanation of it's flaws, the pros are constant throughout the game and easily overshadows the bad parts. I give this game a 8/10, and being a console pleb that doesn't play PC often since I have a toaster laptop, this is one of my favorite and stand-out entries."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a game that didn't recieve nearly as much notoriety as it should when it came out on PS3. It features a brilliant combat system that is a ton of fun to work out strategies for, and the story does an excellent job in supporting it. If you are looking for a strategy game to scratch an itch of that sort, Valkyria Chronicles should be right up your alley.  Now in terms of the port to PC. Given its a Japanese company (whoes track record for PC hasn't been very good) porting, its far better than I expected or hoped. The game supports resolutions up to 4k (I'm running on 1600x900) and you can either set the game to 30fps or your monitors refresh rate. It looks excellent running at a buttery smooth 60fps, and from what I understand it works just as well at 120 fps. The keys are fully rebindable to boot. However, options don't stretch much further beyond that. And just a note, the pre-rendered cutscenes are in 720p so you will get jagged edges on other resolutions.  Besides the resolution you're stuck with the graphical fidelity you've been given (which is extremely pretty), although that shouldn't be too much of an issue. The game was originally running on a PS3 and doesn't approach intensive in the performance department. But as always, make sure you can run it before buying the bloody thing.  The port isn't perfect, but its serviceable, and in terms of performance and the included DLC, is objectively better than the PS3 version. If you missed out on it the first time, or are looking for an excuse to experience the game again, get it. Its an absolute bargain, and will provide a good amount of fun."
"After putting over a hundred hours into the ps3 version, I didn't even hesitate to buy it again. Absolutely fantastic game.  Here's to VC 2/3 appearing on pc soon!"
Alicia blitz too op
I could go another round!
Simply put a Incredible good port and such an Awesome game holy hell BUY IT well if you like JRPG / Action / tactical games :P
I have played the sequel on the PSP and like it (sadly i didn't finish it and wanted to also play the 3rd version which I hope makes it way on to PC) I'm glad I ordered it yesterday (yay I saved $2.) any way this is a fun game and possible one of the best games from SEGA in recent years and I would recomend this to any one that wants to try something a bit differnt because this isn't your typical turned based JRPG but a little something different. I liked the fact that I was reading Megatokyo and in one of the rant DOM was saying how much he liked the game.Now stop reading this 'horrible' review and start playing the game already.
"If you ever need an example how a good console-to-PC port should be, look no further. This game was extremely underappreciated and underexpected when it came out way back when, so opening it up to a broader audience at lower pricepoint is very good for the series. And hopefully SEGA sees the signs this sets, as it occupies top seller at time of writing this.  Technically, it's not the new gold-standart by any stretch of the imagination, but it's definately one of the best ports i have laid eyes on so far. It has actually working, good Keyboard+Mouse controls - which work really well with the gameplay being strategic map and third person. Though, gamepads are just as supported and it plays basically like the console version we remember playing. On top of that come modern resolutions surpassing the original PS3 one, alongside FPS/Vsynch and windowed Options. So some adaptability to individual parameters is possible, unlike most console ports out there. Similiar for sound and keybinds. Not super fleshed-out, but satisfactory.  The game as such is a good mix of turnbased strategy and third-person action RPG. Using a top-down tactical map, one selects and places their units on the battlefield and then controls them individually in a third-person view. During this time, moving them around consumes Action Points and you get 1 opportunity to shoot/grenade/heal/repair/etc per unit every time you control it. Taking control of a unit costs Command Points, once you're out of CP, your turn ends and the Enemy takes theirs in the same fashion, except you will only see them move pieces that you have visual contact to with one of your units (you'll also see it from that unit's point of view) otherwise you'll be left in the dark with questionmarks indicating possible, rough enemy positions and and out of sight moves just showing 'Shuffle, Shuffle' sound effects. This effectively acts as the game's variant on Fog of War.  Your squad will consist of 6 different unit types usually. Scouts have the highest AP, so they will be able to quickly cover a lot of ground and take objectives or give visuals on areas of the map, like camps or streets. Schocktrooper are less agile then Scouts, but they carry MGs instead of the Scouts' rifle. This enables them to make short work of infantry, while also being armored against MG and rifle fire. The third class are Lancers, which are usually the only way to take out armored targets (like tanks). They are also very slow and armored against explosives, which luckily includes tank shells and mortars. The other fast-moving class are Engineers, who are able to repair tanks and sandbag-barricades as well as disarm mines. In exchange, their direct combat abilities are weak in both offense and defense. The last group is the snipers, who have the lowest AP, but also the highest firing range, accurace and anti-infantry damage. That's only 5 and the sixth kind is not so much a group, as you only get a single Tank. It obviously destroys Tanks, Infantry and Obstacles alike, employing shells, mortars and MG fire while also being able to run over sandbags or bust through (predetermined) walls.  There's a whole lot of tinkering to be had between the different roles and who specifically you assign to your squad and deploy, as individual recruits have different traits like e.G. pollen allergy that makes them less effective in forested combat zones or terrible/amazing night vision boosting/reducing their accuracy in the dark. Also, friendships with other recruits are to be considered for bonus team attacks.  RPG-like upgrading of weapons, units and traits exists, but it's mostly linear so your toys just get better and there's no wrong options to take. Not frustrating like other systems, but also no noteworthy variety.  The game also looks great, even for it's age. Only the prerendered cutscenes are a tiny bit lacking on higher resolutions, as they are still only in 720p. As for the story, it's mostly just an anime-ish war story in alternate universe Europe around 1935. As with most things, that's down to taste and hit or miss, so no further comment on that.  All in all: Solid game, good port. Also automaticalyl includes the content that was originally offered as DLC on the PS3. Well worth the money. You can pay more and get less for it elsewhere."
The best game since Resident Evil 4. That's pretty much all there is to it!
"Decent port.  not great but decent enough without any ridiculous console limits such as resolution or framerate cap.  SEGA usually put out a decent console port and this one isn't different.  runs smooth 60fps at 1440p on my setup from the get-go.  plus they actually listens to thier customer feedback and attempts to fix any existing bugs post release.  The game is awesome. it's a turn based strategy RPG game with little bit of third person action/shooter elements thrown in. combat-wise, it shares a lot of similarity with xcom enemy unknown.  if you're fan of xcom, definitely give this one a try.    + native resolution support + 60FPS+  + optional Japanese audio + the game itself  - realtime cutscenes run at crappy console resolutions(720P i think)"
"Another Winner for Sega. A deep yet easy to learn strategy title. The graphics are really pretty and painting like. This proves that it is not always necessary for a game to strife for photo realism and still have great visuals. The story is deeply engaging, something you would not have at first glance with all the kuai going on.  My only little complain is that the game some times is a bit slow to engage, e.g. when selecting units on the maps or the player phase begins, this should be a bit quicker."
This is my first recommendation of any steam game I have (I have way too many) i've only played a handfull of missiions but from what I played I did not want to stop playing the port is great in my opinion not one crash in almost 4 hours of straight gameplay and the graphics are perfect due to the art style nothing that will blow your mind but i'ts better than almost any port I've played.
"WOW. This game totally surpassed my expectations.   - TANKS! - WW2esque/steampunk setting - Great character design, weapon design and tanks designs - The game graohics looks like it's on a painting and it works wonders.  - Very engaging story - Amazing strategy elements: units have traits (eg. hates the desert/loner) and different specialities (scout, lancer) - Really utilise cover, weapon range, weapon specialities, armor ratings, elevation etc as strategy elements - Enemies shoot you as you move. Cover became really valuable. - Great team battle system becase they can support each other as they attack - It's a JRPG  I can't think of any negatives  11/10 Can't get myself to play a different game at the moment"
"The absolute best strategy/rpg from the PS3 era is out on the PC at last. I loved this game on the PS3 and it is just as good now on the PC. The art style is great, the music matches the scenese perfectly. You owe it to yourself to play this game if you are a fan of strategy/rpg games. It even includes all the DLC from the PS3!!"
"Their are some early bugs, but if you can work past the couple of them (which will hopefully be patched out) this is a great narritive and Turned based combat experience. The fighting is interesting, the story is deep and dark, and the RPG elements add a lot to customization. I have not finished the game but so far I am enjoying it very much.   (Played with a 360 controller btw so I am unsure how keyboard would work.)"
"Great game -Characters are actually characters with their own voice, personality, specials, and story -Top down strategy with third and first person action per unit -Story is fully fleshed out -Artwork was and still is unique at the time of inception (2008), though not the best in quality  Cons -So far the only large problem I've noticed is that tanks have issues driving up inclines, never had that with PS3 ver. -Graphics could have been touched up for higher res. monitors -random number god hates me -Needs a PC sequel, either more into galia vs Imp or Fed vs imp. (VC 2&amp;3 were psp sequels)  Hope they release VC2 and 3 as a bundle on steam, unless they get greedy and port each one seperately, inwhich case i'd sugest just getting VC3"
exquisite game with a huge amount of heart and charm. it's rate to find a title that is as endearing as this one
"One of the very few single-player games I was willing to soldier through 60+ hours in order to beat the game. In short, this game is really good, but not without its fair share of issues as well.  The combination of a tactical strategy game mixed with third person shooter mechanics to some degree is really interesting to see and somehow managed to pull off quite well. To be quite frank, there isn't much to talk about the strategy portion of the game and instead the third person portion takes up most of the spotlight. The real strategy is mainly figuring out how to make the most of your turn doing as much damage as possible to the enemy without getting your soldiers horribly murdered all while completing your objectives as fast as possible. In strategic mode, you are presented a map with the positioning of your soldiers and any enemy within line of sight with the badges on the top of your screen represents your total command points for the duration of your turn. Assuming direct control of a foot soldier will consume 1 command point while tanks consume 2 command points and any unused command points at the end of your turn will be carried over to your next turn. During third person mode, you have an action bar that will slowly deplete while moving around making positioning the key to your troop's survival and you can only perform one action per command point, all while taking interception fire so don't you even think about idling. You can take control of the same unit multiple times, but you can not move as far when moving them for the first time and your walking distance will continue to get smaller the more times you use the same unit to the point where they can only walk 2 steps until the beginning of your next turn. I can't properly critique characters in stories and I'm not going to pretend to, but for the most part I liked them to say the least, even the side characters you are able to recruit to your squad. Death of squad members are caused by enemy contact with their bodies or if none of your units are able to reach them within 3 turns after incapacitation so if you happen to have some sort of personal attachment, I'd suggest you be a bit careful. Sure, you can just restart the mission from a previous save file, but that defeats the purpose of permadeath and there will be no reason for you to be crying over their deaths. Oh, and the story is good. Just like characters, I can't properly critique story without spoiling anything so that's all I will say.  At this point, I'm starting to run out of good things to say. First off, you would think new game+ would provide a more challenging experience. Instead, the difficulty of the AI does not change accordingly and in reality, the only thing that makes the game difficult is how to A rank every mission (a.k.a finish the mission as fast as possible), which most of the time involves bum rushing the enemy with fully upgraded stats and equipment turning Valkyria Chronicles into a puzzle game instead of the original intention of being a tactical strategy game. Now that I think about it, the AI doesn't feel dynamic anymore once I started my second playthrough. Even some of the special orders you aquire throughout the game kinda breaks the balance of difficulty at times so I mostly have no reason to use them since character and equipment upgrades already make you pretty powerful if you play smart. Speaking of difficulty, there have been occational difficulty spikes here and there, but once you're able to figure it out, congragulations, you have experienced the sweet taste of victory despite the overwhelming odds. On a technical standpoint, I have experienced drops in framerate at times making movement a bit clunky, but hey, it's not a twitch shooter so it's tolerable, although it's a bit annoying regardless. I did try playing some of the challenge missions and the English dialog seems to be bugged so I got nothing but silence so I tried the Japanese voices and somehow, they worked. What? Oh yeah, and there is no mouse control in any of the menus, but it's only a minor nitpick at best. Some of the options like locking framerate and resolution requires you to open a separate launcher in order to adjust those settings.  Overall it's not a brilliant port, but it's competent and hey, at least it functions properly, unlike a certain cinematic AAA rooftop jumping simulator."
"Would highly recommend if you like turn base strategy games. You are Welkin a nature lover and soon to be leader of squad 7. Make every turn count because it could mean the difference between life and death for your squad, the art style in my opinion is beautiful and the story enjoyable. Each character has there own unique personality and different perks that can be used to your advantage based on the environment that the battle is taking place and there are many squad members that you can hand pick. 7/10"
"The best turn based strategic game I played this year ,easily surpass the latest xcom games imho The balance and degree of freedom is just perfect "
Great game A few annoying bugs though that cost you a rank/grade.  Then there's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ like the tank missing at point blank range. Waste of two CPs.
"Colorful Oil Painted artstyle, interesting scout driveby combat, characters that are easy to love.  Dont use lancers and get your bang 4buck game right here"
"Beautiful, compelling and full of heart. A wonderful and challenging game. This game engaged me in a way I haven't been engaged in years. The characters are well crafted and the story is incredible. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a rewarding story driven experience set it a beautifly crafted world."
"The critically acclaimed PS3 title 'Valkyria Chronicles', inclusive of all DLCs, was ported over to the PC by Sega and released on the platform late last year. It is a turn-based squad strategy game incorporating strong flavours of a third-person shooter.   The game is set in a neutral and non-partisan fictitious small country, Gallia, situated in the continent of Europa. The land is rich in the mineral ore Ragnite, a much sought after ingredient due to its vital properties that see it being used both as fuel and medicine. The Empire, an alliance of autocratic Eastern Europan nations, declares war on The Federation, an alliance of democratic West Europan nations, to kick-start the Second Europan War (EWII). The Empire has its sights set on Gallia's ragnite rich deposits.  You play as Welkin Gunther, a Gallian and son of celebrated war-hero, General Gunther, as you command a troop of organized Gallian militia soldiers known as Squad 7 whose job is to thwart The Empire's advances in Gallia. During the course of the playthrough you command foot soldiers and tanks as you set forward to complete objectives and, thus, win battles in the process. The game is divided into chapters which is further sub-divided into small episodes.   First things first, the game is gorgeously good-looking. The art-style is inspired by Japanese animes while the visuals are unique, feeling as though the entire game is a sharp watercolour painting brought to life.   The game has five combat Classes; namely Scouts (Rifle), Shock Troopers (Infantry), Lancers (Anti-Tank), Engineers and Snipers. In addition, you also get to control Commanding Officer Welkin's tank. All equipment is upgradeable, relying on XP points which are gained as missions are completed. The Combat system is an amalgam of turn-based and third-person elements. You deploy a squad of your choice and each time you click on a squad member, the camera pans to third-person and he can be moved to an appropriate place. The camera then swings back to the bird's eye view of the map allowing you to plan your next move. Combat is challenging and is easily the best part of the game. Level environments are well-designed and test your strategic skills to the hilt.  The game's setting is inspired by real-life incidents, with a mix of fantasy and fiction elements thrown into the mix. The plot is, frankly speaking, nothing to write home about. It's B-grade anime with trope characters and a cliched predictable story. There are a few instances in the game where the plot impresses but, highly unfortunately, those are few and far between.  I really liked the game. The war-setting negated some of the cheesy anime moments and the combat was fun and challenging. I'm glad Sega ported this over to the PC. Valkyria Chronicles is a definite recommendation from my side, if just for a refreshing change of art-style and grueling turn-based gameplay."
"I sent a teenage girl from a bakery into battle during WWII. I gave her a gun and some grenades. I stacked motivational speeches on her to boost her stats. She captured the enemy base in a single turn.  German war tactics are trash, Blitzkrieg ain't got ♥♥♥♥.  This is true warfare. "
"This game is by no means a masterpiece but it definitely gets close. The art may turn off some because 'hurr durr weaboos get out' but the core of the game is still great. Strong gameplay mixed in with a good, albeit somewhat cliche, story and mixed in with so many characters that get fleshed out as you play.    Gameplay  The gameplay is a very unique mix of tactical shooter and rpg. It starts with a deployment team, letting you choose what kind of mix of units you want. The variety is pretty well balanced, with 5 units not including tanks.   Scouts are capable of taking less damage and being able to move much more than the other units.  Shocktroopers are the backbone of your squad, taking the least damage and holding the line.  Lancers are the designated anti-armor unit, capable of destroying high threat targets with some support.  Snipers are a coin toss. You either hit or you don't, but later on they bring some better numbers and become a vital asset.  Engineers are crucial as well, being the only class to repair tanks which are your driving force of your squad. You get access to two tanks, one in the first half and another in the second half. The first tank acts as the main driving force of your squad, being able to take tons of damage and deal tons of damage. The second tank has the ability to change weapons according to what kind of battle will take play. More enemies? Flamethrower. More armor? Tank rounds. Etc.  The enemy AI however suffers from some hiccups, sometimes moving back and forth without accomplishing anything or moving into enemy sightlines to be gunned down.  And of course almost every attack is RNG based so some frustration will be an emotion present.  Movement is very XCOM-esque, where in that game you choose a person and tell it what to do. In Valkyria Chronicles, you become the character and dictate every move it does. This allows for a ton of micro-management for hardcore gamers looking to break this game.   There are also miscellanous things that make the game flow much smoother such as base camps. They allow you to withdraw and deploy squad members. This lets a sniper that was shooting from base to teleport to the new battle zone.  Another thing is squad leader bonuses and attributes. Some characters, primarily the main characters, provide a bonus to your command points that let you make more moves with your units. Their lives are crucial in improving effectiveness of the whole squad. That said, the main characters have some of the most powerful traits, a concept I will talk about in a second, which means that you have to weigh the options and know when to risk one of these squad members or keep him/her back. An aforementioned mechanic is character traits. Each squad member has certain traits that let them perform better or worse. These traits are all pre-determined. This makes some characters much stronger than others in some situations. For example, there is a trait called Child of Nature. This makes some characters act better in places with more vegetation such as forests. It also however makes these characters weaker with paved roads, such as city fights. Mixing and matching these characters to fit your next battle is both challenging and fun.  There are also abilities called orders, which can be used with command points. They grant bonuses, heal allies, and attack enemies depending on the order. These orders can turn the tide of the game and possibly save your allies. Some of the stronger orders, however, cost more command points meaning that your squad will be slow to advance.  Overall the gameplay promotes strategy, tactics, and a little bit of luck to win through these fights. Many bonuses are offset with penalties, and finding the right balance is what makes this game so much fun.    Plot/Characters  The plot is basically this: An autocratic nation similar to Russia and a democratic collection of states are constantly at war with eachother, and the main character's homeland is independent. Mr. Fake Russia decides to attack your nation due to the high amounts of a certain resource in the nation's land. The plot overall is pretty fun and sometimes takes you deep into the meaning of war and such. It may come off as a bit pretentious and glorified in what happens but it's still a decent plot for such a good game.  Every single squad member you can recruit has a personality, history, and relationship with others. The best thing about how they do the characters, is that they don't shove it down your throat. They don't tell you what happens to all of them in the main story. You have to look for it yourself in the logs of them. This makes it so people that don't really care can just focus on the main squad and the game, where others who are curious about the others can investigate their relationships. Their friendships with others even becomes a gameplay mechanic, where if you have someone who likes someone in close proximity, they gain a boost in stats. Which is pretty realistic imo.  Also any squad member that isn't part of the main group can die and never be recruited again. This makes the management of each character's health pretty important in the game as to not sacrifice a certain strong character such as Vyse.   Music  Pretty good overall. Music is composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, who has done scores for many games such as Finaly Fantasy XII, Tekken 6, and Final Fantasy Tactics.    Miscellaneous  There is a choice between English and Japanese dubs for the game. English does more to give accents to some of the characters, such as giving an Irish accent to Catherine O'Hara. It's preference but it's nice that they give you an option  The cutscenes are pretty nice for 2008. The visuals are akin to watching an animated water colored painting, resulting in some pretty unique and outstanding visuals.  That said, however, some may see the colorful watercolor visuals as an affront to war games. The setting, if read without any visuals, is actually pretty gruesome in the amount of death that entails. The visuals sort of cushion that, letting people that don't like the tense and dark atmosphere of other games but still want a game like this.   The camera is third person. While this isn't inherently bad it also sometimes makes some of the sightlines a bit wonky at times.   There is also a skirmish feature which lets you go to previously played maps and play them out, earning money and experience points. They also cut out the dialogue making these games much faster.  There are also two 'side campaigns' in the game. One being Edy's Mission: Enter the Edy Detechment, which feels a lot more personal with the characters. Albeit it does not include the core members of the base game very much. It gives more character development with certain characters and provides seven more missions, the initial mission and the bonus six challenges that follow it. There is also a side campaign where you play the game as if you were in the position of the Imperials, named 'Selvaria's Mission: Behind Her Blue Flame' It gives introspective on the Imperial's, and Selvaria's, thoughts during the war against Gallia. All of these missions also give something for the player in the main game, giving another incentive to play them out.    Final Thoughts  Overall the game is very strong. Many critics give it the acclaim it deserves tbh. A fresh look on tactical squad shooters and a decent story, fitting music, massive amount of fairly well developed characters, and fantastic visuals for both its time and now. Its occasional stupid AI and my own frustration with this game make me give it a 9/10  "

"Best anime and ww2 tematics game i ever played. Story,Tactics,Balance,Anime and that brilliant engine. 96/100 where pc Azure Revolution?"
"Valkyria Chronicles is clearly a fantasy WWII where Scandinavia doesn't exist, Hitler isn't a thing, Stalin is a still evil but a twenty-something pompous ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with multiple personality disorder who's upset his siblings made fun of him...or something. It also has optional, free save-scumming DLC but that might just be a personal issue.   The combat in VC, where you'll be spending most of your time, is a modern take on the old Final Fantasy Tactics, SRPG except with guns. It does away with the tile/grid based system and makes it into a more open style where your characters can go where they can, with distance restrictions based on class and instead of over head camera, it's now third person. Moving is about the only similar thing compared to traditional TRPGs, though. Usually, you can do two things during a characters turn, move and attack. In VC, though, you can move, attack, heal, hide in the environment (tall grass, behind sandbags, from view), and retreat from the battle to call new allies - all in the same turn. While attacking, you can a few things depending on class. While all classes can shoot/launch rockets (normal attack), other classes can use grenades or repair the tank. Engineers can even disarm mines while in movement. Detonating mines can also be done in movement and doesn't end turn, although it's not as effective as when an engineer does it. Healing also works similar to attack whereas you can't heal and then aim for someone. The interesting thing of note is, while moving, there is crossfire. No more will you or your enemy look upon your attacker and say, 'Hey, hit me'. Now they will say, 'if you don't kill me, I will kill you before you get here'. Every attack is also a counter attack so it's a very offensive based game with defensive in mind as well. It's the best of both worlds and the combined worlds are great!  There are 19 chapters (including prologue) and about 25 battles. There are also an infinite, although with pre-programmed AI, number of skirmishes to 'grind' exp and money for all those late game weapons and level required potentials and orders. Across those chapter and battles you meet a diverse cast of characters, some of which are distinguishable from each other and you stop the invading Soviets from invading Estonia (or Lithuania/Latvia).   Story wise, the scenes are short for those who just want to play and not watch but that also means a lot of things get rushed. The love story (as all RPGs have) feels slightly rushed. The game takes place over seven months and the story scenes take place over 22-24 days - if you get the special reports which are easy to get so I'm including them - over that time frame. I can't but wish a few more reports or other special scenes were including with the game so help to alleviate some of this but that could be because I'm all about story and character development which, while strong for the 12 or so main characters, is weak for the rest of the cast and must be earned through various battle strategies. It's a shame, too since a lot of the characters have interesting backstories and interactions with each other.   Visually, the game was built on an engine that as, so far only been used for the Valkyria Chronicles games that SEGA calls the CANVAS graphics engine. Its whole point seems to be to make everything look like a watercolored wonderland. Assuming you find war to be a wonderland, of course. The only odd/annoying thing about the engine is the border of everything is uncolored and is just an outline. It's not a major deal but it just seems unnecessary. Why not finish it? Characters look anime-ish so typical Japanese video game-ness here.   When it comes to music, it's wonderfully atmospheric. Many of the songs are orchestrated. Sadly, most of the songs aren't even heard. There's really only six or songs that get any sort of recollection out of me. Fortunately, the whole soundtrack is available in new game plus so give it a listen if you want to. Usually, I like to add official previews or downloads but I can't find any NA versions so here's an  RPGFan.com  review that's better than anything I can write on the OST as well as a few previews. Or, ya know, go to unofficial Youtube channels.    RPGFan  [www.rpgfan.com]   I picked-up Valkyria Chronicles because I wanted a game like Final Fantasy Tactics that wasn’t a game I've beaten 7 million times. I've tried a few and they ended-up being boring, mundane, mistakes. I currently have nearly 60 hours of playtime and I'm still not done with the new game plus and achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ing (although my drive died and my net sucks so 25gigs is painful). I finished the game in 50 or so hours before I went NG+, so there's a low price per hour. It's not FFT, it's not better, but it's doesn't have to be and no one should expect it. But it's good for the same reasons and then some."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a tactical RPG by Sega. More than that though, it's equal part game as it is story; half the entertainment comes from what happens outside of the battlefield.  Unlike a game such as Mass Effect however where the story is driven by the player, Valkyria Chronicles takes a more classic 'Kinetic' approach; there are no major decisions to make, yet watching the characters interact with each other in a Light Novel-esque approach definitely adds another layer to the game.  There was clearly a lot of effort put into making the story what it is; there are mysteries, foreshadowing, drama and suspense at all turns. Even the way the game is presented - as a book where you flip from page to page to select episodes/missions - is well organized, and helps players keep track of what happened and when.  But more than just the format, this is the kind of game where you start to grow for the characters. Not just the main characters either; there's a major involvement when it comes to selecting your squad. With dozens of members to choose from, even team members of the same class will not perform the same - they will have different likes/dislikes, different people they get along with, and different lines, somewhat in the vein of Fire Emblem. There is room for both the RPG fan who likes finding strategies and synergies, as well as the more casual RPG-er who wants to put together what is essentially a family. No, the secondary characters don't have many lines (there are dozens after all), but they each have their own touches that make them come to life; do you pick the character who has average traits (but gets boosts when near allies), or do you pick the character who has good traits (but hates your main character's guts)? Do you prefer the British sniper who provides boosts to her friends, or the lone huntress? There's a lot of fun to be had picking out your squad... and a lot of tearful partings, as it is possible to permanently lose your members in combat if they are not rescued after losing all their health.  As a game, Valkyria Chronicles is both challenging and fun. However, there is such a thing as a 'right' way to play, which is what prevents this game from being excellent. The issue stems with the ranking system; completing a mission faster means extra rewards which means less trouble further down the line. This makes it very tempting to 'save scum' before risky plays, as the game lets you save mid-game at nearly any point, including right before chance-reliant accuracy checks. This isn't helped by the fact that you CANNOT repeat Story Missions; if you lose out on the bonus experience of a high rank, you have to go and farm special skirmish battles to make up the difference. It is not that skirmishes are boring (some are quite fun), but no one wants to be pressured to do them because they missed a bit of EXP. You are also tempted to save-scum because you rarely know the exact layout of the battlefield beforehand; do you use your sniper? Can you even use one? If you have too many shocktroopers, will some get left behind on this map? The decision is a bit uninformed... unless you save right before deployment.  The 'right' way to play this game would be to adopt a 'try to save everyone' mentality. It gets very tempting to charge into gunfire when it is possible to restart at any point, but the game really is a lot more involved if the player is forced to carry out rescues over bad decisions rather than restarting before the decision took place. As well, players adopting this mentality should consider starting missions with underneath the maximum number of troops in order to call in what is needed further down the line; you can either take 5 turns to move a unit to the front line, or call them in halfway through the fight for two, for instance.  Other than that one flaw of the ranking system, the strategy involved in planning out your advance is fairly solid. Not only that, but the game will throw some fairly impressive looking challenges at you, from open fields to towns to trench-filled war-zones, and it is easy to slip up. Yet there is immense satisfaction in winning; even getting a low ranking, being able to make it out rewards the player with more story and new ideas on how to approach different situations.  Also, the game has a distinct lack of bugs. Grenades tend to go where you want them to, I've never had a scripted event occur incorrectly, and characters do not tend to get stuck in terrain or anything of the sort. Overall, it's a very well-polished and emotionally involved RPG; what is there not to love? This is a game that is definitely worth picking up at some point - to some, this game will be snagged at a 75% discount, but this is the kind of game you could justify biting the bullet and paying a little more for about 40 hours of good ol' strategy/RPG goodness.  Alright, so maybe the main character IS a bit of a Gary Stu, and some of the plot twists are a little predictable. Despite that, many of the game's more emotional moments hit right on the mark, and many of the villains become quite interesting as the story develops. I'd be hard pressed to call it the best story evar (some characters could use a little more depth and there are occasional inconsistensies), but heck if it doesn't give you a little tug at times. If one does become a fanboy, there's an anime based off the game that follows a similar storyline to quell the hunger."
"im not a fan of this type of game, but its is really well made"
"A game tipe tactics with a really lovely story, just like gonna hurt your kokoro"
Always dreamt of a third person srpg with non-tiled movements which this game have. 8.5/10
"9/10 for this amazing gameplay, graphic and port. But I would be willing to give this game another 5 points if it has DLC or even online feature :) Don't you dare compare this game to AC-Unity, this game wins in every aspect you can think off!! Plus: Nearly perfect port from the PS3 version Minus: Can't think of anything yet, will update this review once I made decent progress on the game. Hope: VC 2&amp;3 to be ported as well Not Hope: VC 2&amp;3 not to be ported Do I recommend this game? If you're an idiot, NO!!  Edit: It appear the DLC is already inside the game, my bad. So yeah, 14/10 would recommend this game.  PS: it may be a wild hope, but this game would be so nice if it has online feature XD"
"Yes! Totally yes! If you like strategy/turn-based games, you should grab this one. They did a good job with the port, it's not excellent but it's very good. And I think you'll probably love Alicia :3  12/10  AND WATCH THE ANIME, YOU FILTHY SCRUB."
"Finally a great singleplayer game, this game made 2014 make a little better after all the s@#t that we saw.  The Good  +Story The story has a nice pace and keeps begging you to continue playing (after a session i looked at the clock and it was 2:00 AM O.o) There's action, comedy and drama. All used in the right time in the right place. It's kinda similar to WW2 but don't expect anything fancy such as Call of Duty, you are a comander that is just trying to protect your country and keep you and your teammates alive.  I like to compare Gallia to Finland. Why? Because both countries had to defend themselves against a bigger country with more military power (Finland defended against a USSR invasion in the Winter War and won).  +Characters Nice character development, your squad becomes from people who couldn't understand each other to a big united family. Unfortunately not all characters are shown in the cutscenes (only the main ones, the secondary units you can choose only appear in battle). But the characters that appear have their own unique personalities and traits.  +Gameplay It can be difficult in the beggining since the battle system is different from other games, if you ignore the basics you will have your ♥♥♥ kicked. But once you understand the game mechanics the A.I. can be defeated easily (sometimes). I can compare it to XCOM: turn based, each unit can move for a limited distance and can only fire once. The only difference is that you have a X amount of CP at each turn, selecting a unit to control consumes 1CP point (2 CPs if it's a tank). There are missions that you'll say 'really?! That was easy!' and other missions that you'll be sweating because the enemy has 3 tanks in your face.  +Graphics Unique artstyle. I'm happy that the developers tryed to create something unique and beautiful without trying to use super hyper mega ultra realistic graphics (I mean if you want realistic graphics, why not just go outside?)  +Soundtrack Nice. The right music in the right moment feels great.  +Bonus SEGA included ALL DLC that was released for the PS3 version for free, they could have been greedy like some companies *cough* EA *cough*.  The not so good -RNG (random number generator) Sometimes the random values can ruin the moment. Ex: each weapon has a orange circle that represents where the bullets may hit, so you can get lucky and hit the headshots you need or the RNG will troll and 90% of the shots miss.  -some bugs Some users reported some bugs that even prevents them playing the game, but that's only a minor part. If you find an issue go to the forums you'll find some people eager to help."
"great art, story, and gameplay."
amazing gameplay amazing story amazing characters amazing dialogue amazing japanese voice acting amazing port  NEVER EVER 
"I am enjoying this game and the storyline, I bought it on sale and I would pay full price for it, Its a game that I will try and get my friends and my brothers to buy it or i will get them a copy for birthdays or christmas because i know they will enjoy it as much as i am, its a game i will play game+ even game++ im 60HRS on so far, I am playing another game atm so when my friends arent online I will be getting back to this one as i have the time."
Good game with a nice PC port. It's a turn base Stragy game that happens in third person point of view.  every aspect of the game is good overall
"Good Storyline, Visually Appealing, Nice Soundtrack, However, do be good at strategy games are you may end up having to repeat 2 hours worth of work again. "
let's make some fresh bread (this is what xcom should have been)  moink
Perky and motely crew of soldiers fighting in a WW2 fanfiction...obviously a buy!
"Valkyria Chronicles is one surprise after another. I for one did not expect to be hooked into this game within a few mins of the story unfolding. The story is outstanding with great character development. Many feels are held within this title. One that will not be forgotten for some time.   With that being said, the art style of the game is unique as is rarely done with many AAA titles today. Which adds a unique feel to the storyline and how everything plays out. There are many great things about this title that I love. However, there are some things that are somewhat troublesome from a Console (30 FPS) port to a PC (Limitless FPS). This was of course a PC port from the console version that was release quite some time ago, and is a pretty well done port to say the least. However a few things I have to nag on.   1. Poor Cut scene quality: Most of the cut scenes in the game are at their native created resolution from when the game was developed at 720p. This makes it somewhat unbearable when it comes to monitors that have standard 1080p or even higher. If it weren’t for the development for the story, it can be eye straining after a few hours.   2. FPS Bugs Galore: This game is somewhat based on animations keyed on FPS. Seeing as the base game and all the animations were based on the console maximum 30 FPS, increasing the FPS to today’s standards of 60+ on PC and you start getting animation glitches and gameplay altering problems that make the game somewhat more aggravating. For example, Im running at 144hz meaning my fps will be 144 or higher depending on Vsync options. Characters will speak, turn their heads in response then “immediately” snap to another direction. This is not a game breaker but can be somewhat irritating if you’re trying to figure out what the character was trying to do. This issue persists on any FPS higher than 30. Another problem with that is that Tank movement and other “Gun Emplacements” or enemy tank fire will result in an instant death in almost any instance. Since the game is FPS action based. A machine gun from a tank firing say 7 rounds on 30 fps would practically double or even triple to 14 or 28 shots in the same given time if it were fired at 30 fps. Tanks will sometimes even snap and spin in circles due to the increased fps. This makes the later missions almost impossible as turrets snap and fire faster than miniguns at your characters or the scripted movement of a tank that 'has' to get somewhere simply cannot due to overcorrection sometimes leaving you having to alt f4 as the turn will never finish.   Overall the game is great, with a few PC port issues, it is definitely well worth every penny if you are one that loves great stories, in a anime looking environment. Many feels in this one. Of course, there is an official anime based on this game as well, that you should check out if you end up beating it and need more Valkyria Chronicles. ;)"
"I'd like to say that while the story isn't the most original thing out there, it's still fun and moderately entertaining. The art style is extremely unique and satisfying, and leaves nothing be desired in that regard. The gameplay itself is awesome if you're a fan of turn based strategy. I'm coming from a HUGE fondness of XCOM, Front Mission, Final Fantasy Tactics, etc... and this game is in a similar vain.  While there are certainly deeper strategy games out there, this one achieves an awesome balance of playability, challenge, and novelty."
nice game for relaxing after long stressful works
"When you have to account for the allergies of a 20-person team so that the MC can become a schoolteacher and his girlfriend can get some work done on her buns, if ya know what I mean *wink*"
"A very good example of turn-based and real time strategy hybrid, I definitely recomend this game to fans of the genre.  + Combat mechanics are unique and works really well. + English voice acting is really good. + Story is a little cheesy but it will carry you to the end. + Lots of side quests, upgrades, skirmish battles, cutscenes. + There are tanks! With tons of upgrades! + Nice anime style graphics.  - Cutscenes can be a little cheesy and cringy.  That's all. Thanks Sega for bringing this game to Steam.  EDIT: People are upset about the rating system in the game. They're right but I didn't care about it, I didn't let it tell me that I sucked even if it was an epic experience. I've never seen a Japanese game with a proper rating system, they all suck and will frustrate you. Just ignore it and game will become a lot better experience."
"Really good strategy game. It's like a simpler version of X-com in a way. Also this game has Dual Audio which scores huge points for me. Overall, great game and I cannot wait for Valkyria Chronicles 2 to get ported."
"After playing the second game 1st, i find this one to be more enjoyable and not too anime. Great story and great missions with extra challanges. Probably one of Sega's better current IPs."
10/10 Suck at this game..............
"Good turn based strategy game. Anime orientated story and artstyle, also allows you to switch to the original Japanese audio although the subtitles are based on the dub so they don't match all the time.  Runs on toasters however be prepared to watch a lot of cut scenes."
"This game has far and above exceeded all expectations I had of it. The storyline is great, the missions are fun and challenging and it's all delivered really well. I'd heard of the Series before but never really gave it the time of day, I regret that decision in hindsight as this game is fantastic.   The only thing I would say is if you play above a 120hz refresh rate, the tank controls can get a bit wonky but with some clever mouse control things get right."
"fantastic game, fantastic port, fantastic waifus, tank grill a best."
Do it for her. Don't let your best girl die.  10/10
"I LOVE THIS GAME! It already has such a great story line and I just started! I love the idea of the plot and I love where it is headed. Tragedy, Romance, Action, etc. I can't wait for the sotry to develop further! The RPG elements are great to! I recommend this to anyone who loves anime, rpgs, and a nice storyline! 100/10 I Can't Wait For More!"
"if you like strategy, this game is amazing"
This is one of the best game I ever play. Rich and deep story. beautiful music. the graphic might be comic like but I love it this game bring back the true meaning of what a game meant to be. 
"I'm generally not a fan of turn-based combat, but Valkyria pulls it off perfectly!  Great game! 10/10"
"Played the original for ps3 and loved it, playing again for pc and falling all over again with it. Great story, with characters you won't easily forget. The gameplay is superb and the game itself doesn't feel like a port.    And we get a babys ever after ending what not to like XD      "
Fire emblem with guns
WWI XCOM with an Anime filter
"Issa good game. U shud buy it, you will like."
"Valkyria Chronicles is easily my favorite game of all time, played the unholy ♥♥♥♥ out of it back on the PSTriple; couldn't believe it when I heard it was getting ported to PC, ♥♥♥♥ing preordered that ♥♥♥♥ first chance I could . Well worth every cent . I highly recommend this game over any and all others, with a fantastic story, beautiful details on the battlefield, an excellent system all together .  "
I do not want to write a lot. The game for me is great and I play her perfectly. I would recommend as you like tactical games.
So good had to buy it twice.  Ben has a smal P E N I S
"Like X-Com, but with Waifus, 10/10    Oh, and tanks.. dont forget tanks.."
"It's like if Fire Emblem had sex with Call of Duty World at War and raised it in japan. 11/10, like skyrim with guns and strategy."
i need to get more coupons
"Pros - unexpected plot - character design and development - awesome and addictive gameplay - fascinating art and background - alicia  Cons - bugs - journalist - snipers - people with moustache - welkin  Overall = 9.5/10  still, one of the best game i ever played"
"I was impressed, but not surprised...  10/10 would Welk again"
it's like Fire Emblem with guns
"Valkyria Chronicles is unlike anything I have ever played; a turn-based action role-playing game... sorta kinda. That said, I just finished the prologue and look forward to continue. It's always nice to genuinely enjoy something new, and not feel pressured into liking it."
"Awsome game - great story, lovely animated graphics creating awesome effect, beautiful soundtrack. Pure love! God damn shame Sequels are for PSP..."
"Fantastic game, great story, what more do you want?"
Years ago I wanted this game so bad I almost bought a playstation. Thank goodness it was finally ported to PC! Extremely enjoyable even if not perfect.
"VC originally came out on PS3 in 2008. It comes from the relatively rare genre of turn-based strategy. FOr those who enjoyed the Front Mission or Final Fantasy Tactics, VC should also be enjoyable.  My favorite aspect of this game is the graphics, which are meant to look as though they are drawn in colored pencil. The storyline is somewhat like a Miyazhaki movie, in the sense that it takes place in a fictitious 20th century Europe. There is of course the obligatory evil Empire, and the less evil tiny country simply trying to survive. Like Final Fantasy and many other console games over the last 15 years, it is rife with cutscenes. I chose the Japanese audio, so I don't know what the english audio sounds like.   The game play, while not exactly innovative, is still entertaining, and requires a lot of critical thinking on thge player's part.  "
"I have nothing but good to say of this game. Runs perfectly on my PC, in great resolution. Perfect controller support, and a surprising emulation of the PS3 save screen. Sega should release the other games on steam, and for 5 bucks on sale IT SHOULD BE A CRIME TO SELL THIS GAME THAT LOW."
"It's a great game but it has two major flaws.  1-No autosaving, my game crashes and freezes frequently and I've wasted a lot of time replaying all that crap again.  2-As I mentioned above, crashes and freezes.  "
Ahhh nostalgia..  Valkyria Chronicles is a solid turn-based tactical strategy game mixed with some jrpg elements and macro management elements similar to that of the Fire Emblem series.  Only gripe I have is that the PC version is truly a blatant port from the original hash; that has some very minor issues but but still would've been great if SEGA added better feature implementations for this port.
"One of my all time favorites, glad it finally made it to steam so I can respend some time in this wonderful world."
I get 75% coupon of this game. -this game graphic is great -I play it for a 30 minute before sleep and i want to play it much more tomorrow.  I'm so sad my pc is can't get full speed. I will update review soon after play.  I knew it have an anime series. I should watch the anime frist or not ?
"Oh Sega. You have made a fantastic TBS game. To me, it's on par with Fire Emblem. Okay enough gushing for now. Best to give this a proper rub down.  Pros:  The first time you play this game [given if you don't skip the intro bit after the Sega Logo shows up] is that the art style that the game has is beautiful. It's like watching drawings come to life with how the effects work. If you ever get the chance, you could make a pretty awesome screenshot in the game that's wallpaper worthy for your computer. The story really gets to you as you play through it. You begin to form bonds with the cast of likable characters as soon as you begin playing the game, which is a great way to start any game. With characters in mind, you wouldn't believe how colorful they can be. You'd be surprised by some of them when you begin forming your version of Squad 7 when you, for example, pick a buff guy and heard his voice and personality shows he's more than meets the eyes. I'm looking at you Jann. Don't ever change. Gameplay's pretty good, save for one, but I'll get onto that later. It's a Turn Based Strategy game, but it has a bit of a twist. You select a character, and you go into third person with him/her and move them around, where which way you go and when has immediate consequences because you won't take back what you do, and the enemy [and your forces] will fire at the active soldier moves into range. This makes you really need to think about every move, or you will have a fallen ally on your hands. However, unlike the Fire Emblem games before Awakening, when an ally soldier's down, they don't die instantly. You can save them when an ally touches them before three turns pass. I loved that feature because I ALWAYS wanted to keep everyone alive. There's so many features that I loved about this game, but the good will have to end for now because of the...  Cons:  Back to gameplay, there's one feature I didn't like and that's the tank controls. I don't know if it could be the default controls for keyboard and mouse or what, but there were times where moving around makes it a struggle to get it in the right spot. It drove me nuts. The second, and last bad point is the music. Nothing seems to stick with me when I listen to them, but then again, it's my opinion. I bet there's fans that loves the music. [3/18/16: One song finally sticks with me. If you ever get the chance, listen to 'A Love Passed On']  Extra Bits: Now already, this game's a great game for those that love strategy games, and want a great story with great characters. What could make it better? The free DLC that comes with the game. You get more skirmish missions that focus on the various classes. A mission where you play as Edy's Edy Detactment, which is a pretty tough mission due to the characters you're stuck with. Some are great, good, or ugh... I'm looking at you Susie! You want a harder time? There's EX Hard Mode after you beat the game, which is really hard [which is a guess. I've yet to touch that yet. An update later?]. And for those that like to see the other side of a story, look at Behind Her Blue Flame, which you take command of the Selvaria's forces and learn more about her and her newest engineer.  3/22/16: I got around with playing with the EX Hard Mode DLC, and here's the thing, it only counts for the Base Game's Skirmishes. After beating the game once, you unlock two more difficulties for the nine missions: Hard and Expert. Hard Mode, you're learn REAL quick that positions and/or the entire map gets altered. I bet with enough time and careful planning, you can clear it with no problem. Expert Mode kicks it up a notch and then some. First of all, You have no tank, which means Welkin will be on foot this time. This also means no Orders. It's just pure thinking and making each move count with this mode. Best of luck to you all if you play that mode and may the Valkyrur protect you.  Final Thoughts: This is a must have if you don't have this game on PS3 or PS4 since it'll be getting a re-release as well, which is really neat. My only regret is that the series went onto PSP and we will most likely never see those games on Steam or the consoles. Then again, who knows what the future will hold."
"amazing strategy rpg game, amazing story, beautiful music I love SEGA"
Great game. Just don't be an idiot like me and accidentally overwrite your save with DLC content.
"Finished the game today and am looking forward to replaying all the missions trying to get the best grade possible. What is there to say about Valkyria Chronicles? Well, pretty much all the characters are interesting and lovable, the music is epic and/or beautiful, the story carries you along, missions are sometimes more, sometimes less demanding, and the artwork is really nice as well. While I don't think the turn-based gameplay is bad, it does often come across as very stiff and can sometimes feel repetitive. One thing that I also consider as really well-made is the progression system, which consistently gives you new upgrades and small things to do throughout the whole game. I would rate game length and content A as well. I cannot talk about the English version, since I went with the Japanese synchronisation.   Overall a really awesome game and I highly recommend buying it for the small price of 20€. "
"Well i have come to enjoy it. Once the playing rules are placed out, its easy to follow. I like the storyline from what little i have played of it. Its like watching a classic anime movie or series, very enjoyable to follow. I learn the hard way that not all weapons have unlimited ammo, always keep an engineer nearby when you gain access to them. I am pleased to have discover the game on Steam, i had wanted to play the game, when it was first released, but i did not have the system and choice of what to buy gets in the way. Years later, the game forgotten from my memory until i had encounter it by pure accident."
"This game is amazing. If you like Codename Steam, you will love Valkyria Chronicles."
Simply mesmerizing.. Hope they release the second and third game for PC too!
"Even if you don't get pulled in by the story, the gameplay is more than worth the price."
"New and stunning graphics in a traditional water-painting art-like! Unique gameplay that combines real-time strategy and turn-based strategy! Enjoyable story that tells you in a form of a storybook that even rivals against other well-known anime! This is just too good to be true!  Well, that's the good part but wait until you start playing the game because you need a lot of practice and probably 'trial and error' before progressing to a stage by one by one because how you plan on your tactics and deployment in each battlefield are vital to the gameplay. If you make one small mistake, it's over! You either must improvise carefully or give up and retry! So while the difficulty is very challenging at first, you'll get used to it later on.  So, in conclusion, I would call this a masterpiece for a PS3 game in its time, ported to PC! The gameplay takes on a slow approach but you can finish a level earlier if you really know what you're doing. How you will enjoy this game is very different from other RPG games and that's new but you have to be a very skillful strategy player to fully enjoy this game without feeling frustrated."
"Valkyria Chronicles blends real time strategy with turn based tactics so well that it's basically a genre game of its own. It also has a highly unique story and setting that deserves much praise. The one area that I wasn't particularly fond of, however, was the extremely corny dialog in a number of scenes. Maybe that was to be expected, though, as this is a somewhat light-hearted anime that contrasts heavily with the dark overtones of war and deceit. The cheesy dialog comes in the form of in your face morals when confronted with growing friendships and relationships. Really though, it wasn't that bad, it just came off as super corny sometimes.  Let's start with the story, the game is set in the 1930's in a fictional content called Europa (Europe) where an imperialist force (the East Europan Imperial Alliance) is attacking the Atlantic Federation. It's basically a fictional WWII, but here, it's called the Second Europan War. Well, the central character is Welkin Gunther, a citizen of the neutral country Gallia. Because of Gallia's abundance of Ragnite ore, which is the alternative fuel to petroleum, the Imperial Alliance attacks Gallia. Welkin, while visiting his home town of Bruhl, comes across Alicia Melchiott and find that their town is under attack. The two escape with several other civilians, including Welkin's sister, to the capital city of Randgriz. There, the pair join the Gallian militia and that's where the journey really takes off. Welkin becomes Lt. of Squad 7. The rest of the story involves militia based missions, including espionage, tactical operations, and full out war. It's really great. The story is amazing. And I really loved it.  On the technical side of things, the game really is a tactical RPG, as you can level up the characters for more HP and what not, but it also employs what is called the Battle of Live Tactical Zones (BLiTZ) which is the real time strategy element I had mentioned. During battles, you have an overview map where you can view your characters' placements. When you select a character for movement, you transition to a third person view where you can traverse the map for a duration of how much AP you have. In the map, you can take cover, climb ladders for better views, prone around in grass to hide, and, of course, battle enemies. When you battle enemies, you freeze time, allowing you to aim, much like VATs in Fallout 3. All of these aspects are what make this game so unique. It's a tactical game truly like no other and another reason why I love it so much.   Which leads me to the graphical side of things. Being an anime game, don't expect super realistic graphics, but allow yourself to be pleasantly surprised, anyway, when you see the detail put into the buldings, tanks, outfits, geography, etc. It's a very good looking game, and ported to PC with full HD resolution, the game looks absolutely fantastic. This is a great port. And a truly amazing game. What keeps it from being perfect is just my disdain for some of the cheesy/corny moments; like the pig you rescue that joins your squad. Like... okay.  One last thing before I finish my review; this game can be really difficult. I mean, you really have to strategize and allocate your team to positions that favor winning. The slightest mistake or allowing an ally in your squad to stand out in the open could lead to their death. And if you make that mistake often enough, it'll mean losing the battle. There are probably 5 or 6 battles that I found really difficult and was frustrated throughout, but I eventually prevailed.  9.5/10"
A great deal of fun. A great deal of grinding (if you suck like me). Take your pick.
"Valkyria Chronicles is among the most sombre jrpgs I've ever played. It's not depressing, but it is muted, by jrpg standards. Its characters speak in a constant concerned tone, even in moments of victory. The number of anime cliches it borrows can be counted on your fingers. Its colour pallett consists almost entirely of gun metal grays and desert sand browns. Its humour is often matted in irony, like Alicia's allusion to draft dodging every time she activates her ability Undodgable Shot - 'Don't even think about dodging!'  Despite that, Valkyria Chronicles has a certain vibrance to it. The character design is where most of the charm comes from. To put this into perspective, Edy is a character with not even one line of dialog in the plot who is subject to permadeath if she goes down in battle and is one of over 30 avaliable characters you can have join your squad. Edy got her own DLC. That's honestly just how charming the average character is in this game - they don't all get their own side stories, but they could. Almost none of them look like capable soldiers, but that's all part of the story. Keep in mind this all takes place at the tail end of the war.  Once you take control of your soldiers, you've got a blend of turn based strategy games and a real time tactical shooter, the type where you go down in one or two shots if you get spotted. Since every unit in the game is ranged, most of the strategy revolves around finding cover and cutting off the angles so that the enemy can't advance. Valkyria Chronicles is at its best when, in the course of a larger battle, you're forced to hold a position until you can eek out an advantage by diverting the enemy's attention or landing a decisive blow. Occasionally it shoehorns you into these situations rather than letting them happen naturally, and these missions are a drag. It's also got a few battles that are overly scripted for story reasons which are too linear to really be called strategy, but there are a few scripted battles worth remembering, too."
Xcom with anime girls
"Interesting blend of strategy, RPG and FPS gameplay presented in glorious anime style. Can sometimes be a bit unfair though. Still strongly recommended."
"This is a highly polished, turn-based strategy rpg. The story is great, and it's easy to become attached to the main characters, and to become invested in their struggle. I'm a huge fan of the animation style, which reminds me of Wind Waker.  The combat is highly tactical, and it's a lot of fun to plan out a strategy and carry it out successfully. Each turn, there is a limited amount of commands to give out to your soldiers. You have to decide who to move where, and whether or not they should attack an enemy unit. You have to carefully plan when to be safe and when to charge in. You are quite often at a disadvantage in numbers, so your strategy must be superior to the enemy's strategy.  "

"One of my favorite games of all time. Perfect blend of strategy and RPG. The story, soundtrack and art design are top notch and will have a last impression on me for years to come.  It's not the most in-depth game but it's fun from start to finish and offers a lot of variety in challenge and between missions. Highly reccomend it to anyone who like turn based RPGs or strategy games. Theres something here for both parties."
"This game is basically how the European side of WWII would have been, had it taken place in a high school anime.  That being said it's a very fun, well written, and challenging game that's worth the already low price."
- Great story line - Good combat &amp; gameplay system
"This is a title that was the tipping point to cause me to purchase a ps3 many years ago. There are very few games in which I think every aspect of the game is done well. I'm more of a guy who enjoys gameplay over some deep story but Valkyria Chronicles is one game that stuck out in my mind. When I had first played the game I certainly got a lot more out of it than I had anticipated. Every character is unique and memorable and as you progress through the game you end up growing very attached to squid members that aren't present in many of the game's main cutscenes even.   The difficulty curve is pleasant if scouts aren't being abused and all makes sense and flows very well. Leveling up units is done in such a way you can constantly be using differet characters and not be left behind as classes are improved as a group as opposed to the individual characters within those classes.  Kudos to the team that ported this game to PC. The game supports any 16:9 resolution and refresh rate so long it is supported by your monitor. Not only that but the game itself is not too demanding. I've heard it can be played comfortably on integrated graphics cards even. I have been playing the game at 4k downsampled to 1080p at 60fps and have experienced no slowdown so far on my GTX670. The fact the game will button labels depending on if you are using a controller or keyboard+mouse is a very nice touch. Also I'd like to point out the fact that the game has achievements blows me away, as the original title did not even have trophies on the PS3. The price is also very agreeable. I would have paid 60$ for this title again as it is one of my favorites of all time but the price point it is currently at is very much worth it. I believe I got around 20 hours on the main game alone wwhen I played it the first time on the PS3.  I'm still working through the game right noiw and loving every moment of it :)  TL;DR Buy this game now."
"What XCOM: Declassified Bureau should have been, It's like playing XCOM, third person with constant overwatch and a really interactive shooting and positioning system. Even if you don't usually play strategy games, if you're into third person shooters and want to TRY a strategy game involving some aiming and actual thinking, then this game is a fun purchase that you won't regret."
An intriguing tactica game buried in anime whining. Originally a ps3 exclusive for a long time but recently released on PC.  When i played this on PS3 the load times and sheer number of cutscenes made it unbearable. With a good PC 6 years later the load times are minimal so the deluge of story is bearable between missions.  Very worthwhile if you're bored with xcom at this price.

It's a fun game. Worth it
Nice story and gameplay... really love it
Wanted animu X-com got loads and loads of plot instead.
"This is a hidden gem. Tactical X-com style combat with Japanese animation characters, the difficulty can be quite high. You'll be surprised to see how you end up being emotionally involved with your soldiers. Each of them has specific individual traits, adding some finesse to the management of your team choices at the start of each mission. Achievements are really tough to unlock and for the completion freaks out there the unlocking of all scenes, inventory, and skills will require dedication! Strongly recommended."
"If you don't mind spending half of your time watching cutscenes, the brutal tactical combat is sure to keep you occupied for quite a while indeed."
"I bought this for PS3 when it first came out and played through it several times. It is a timeless classic, definitely worth playing. The unique art style holds up and looks great even so many years after it was first released.   The gameplay is a unique blend of SRPG and real-time action, and it has X-COM style unit interaction with research, perminant death and experience upgrades.  I hope Sega considers releasing the sequels for PC as well. There are good games, there great games and there are special games which you will always remember, even years after you have played them. This is one of those games."
"In principle this game has everything you want in an JRPG. It has a beautyful artstyle. It all looks like a painting, with all the little girls looking great and so cute with their big eyes. The strategy is turn-based. This is how I like it and how it should be. But enough about the minor details and talk story.   The story touches all the important bases for a JRPG. It is bubbly and upbeat, with lots of romances; with the main one between Welkin and Alicia. In addition, there is a cool bathing suit scene which I very much appreciated. Moreover, there is some light bondage and torture fanfic which fits nicely in the story and doesn't feel tacked on. In the end you save the world and get the girl, just like in all my dreams. This makes the game great but not perfect.  There are however some gripes I have with it. Really missed the tenticles. There were many scenes which could be improved by it. For instance when the tank went through the river, Isara could have been fondled a bit by a sea tentacle. Another thing is that quite some backstories of the girls were lacking a bit. Dallas was into girls, but I never got to see her making out with for instance Susie, which would have been epic and sexy.   Another problem is that the control scheme makes the game hard to control one-handed. You need to use WASD to go through menus and press the mouse button to select. Very annoying and this gets you out of the game.  In conclusion, I rate this game a 8 out of 8:::::::D~~~  Please read my Sonic fanfic on deviantart. Username: xxXSonicAssXxx. 911 was an inside job.

"This game has the most awkward fun curve that starts at the very bottom then spikes straight up towards chapter 8-9. The beginning of the game, I thought this game was a strategy game with RNG, which is a terrible idea, but once your characters begin to rank up and you start increasing in accuracy, its more about positioning and unit management.  Now I'm losing sleep. Thanks for that, SEGA."

"I was a huge fan of anime and JRPGs. I committed to playing all the great RPGs of the snes and PS1 eras. I've watched a lot of anime too. But over the last few years that love died out. Seeing the same god damned tropes everywhere began to grate on my nerves like a chainsaw on concrete. And those tropes are present in Valkyria Chronicles as well. But even if you're fed up with those trite, two dimensional characters and their predictable interactions, I actually really enjoyed this game, and I've had a really hard time just finishing games lately.   It's hard for me to pin down why, but I'll go ahead and say the graphics are quite pleasing, as the cel shaded style often is, and the music is pretty fun too (the opening theme almost made me cry once. Don't judge me). There's also the challenge of beating missions as quickly and efficiently as possible, which really opens up in New Game+ but can be highly rewarding when you pull it off the first time around. The combat was a breath of fresh air for me, despite it relying on tried and true dice rolling in the backround. Essentially it's a mix between traditional turnbased and third person shooters. Moving a soldier costs one turn, a tank two, and there are five classes each with their dedicated roles (Scouts, Shocktroopears, Lancers, Engineers, and Snipers) in addition to tanks, all which can be equiped with different loadouts and secondary weapons. One of the things I like is that each soldier is a character, and each character as special quirks, some positive and some negative, referred to as potentials. These can be unlocked by training your units at the boot camp and can be taken advantage of in battle to really take the fight to the enemy. In addition to regular commands, you can also collect powerups called Orders which can boost individuals or your whole unit at the expense of action points.  Finally, the setting has its charm as well. It's basically WWII lite. It doesn't go into the actual horrors of war, really, especially those of WWII, but that's part of why JRPGs are different, and thus appealing to begin with. Still not sure how I feel about how they handled the equivalent to the Jews... maybe I'm overthinking that : P  If you're looking for a fresh JRPG, definitely give this one a try, and if you enjoy simpler but charming characters, you're sure to enjoy the story as well. As you'll be hearing a lot, 'Squad seven, move out!'"
"If you don't mind spending half of your time watching cutscenes, the brutal tactical combat is sure to keep you occupied for quite a while indeed."
"My name is Lt. Welkin Gunther and I'm putting together a special team, and I need some moe soldiers. Moe Darcsen-Gallian soldiers. Now, y'all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon. Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier. We're gonna be dropped into Gallia, dressed as civilians. And once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhackin' guerrilla army, we're gonna be doin' one thing and one thing only... killin' Nazis. Now, I don't know about y'all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Smoky Mountains, cross five thousand miles of water, fight my way through half of Bruhl and jump out of a ♥♥♥♥in' air-o-plane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity. Nazi ain't got no humanity. They're the foot soldiers of a Darcsen-hatin', mass murderin' maniac and they need to be dee-stroyed. That's why any and every every son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ we find wearin' a Nazi uniform, they're gonna die. Now, I'm the direct descendant of the mountain man Jim Bridger. That means I got a little Injun in me. And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance. We will be cruel to the Imperials, and through our cruelty they will know who we are. And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered, and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us. And the Imperials won't not be able to help themselves but to imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels, and the edge of our knives. And the Imperials will be sickened by us, and the Imperials will talk about us, and the Imperials will fear us. And when the Imperial closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us they are tortured with. Sound good?"
"- Battles lack a 'resign' button and for some reason it's impossible to access the system menu during the enemy's turn, which sometimes is infuriating when all you want is to restart the mission instead of waiting the enemy's turn to pass. - There's no way to delete a save file in game, which is weird. - It's too easy, even in harder levels. Once you learn how to beat the mission, it will never again be a challenge. - Ranking system favors speed over quality. It's hard to feel motivated to complete a mission advancing all my characters carefully for a C rank, when I could just issue a couple of orders, rush my scout through the level and beat it in 1 turn for an A rank. - Besides the aforementioned lack of incentive to beat the levels properly, even if players decide to do so they need to consciously restrict themselves. The whole point of the inclusion of reaction fire was to avoid players rushing through the level, but including broken orders like Caution and Defense Boost pretty much defeats the purpose. And these orders are there, in front of us, to be used. They are an integral part of the game that players must deliberately neglect so the game doesn't get too easy. In my opinion, this is a serious game mechanics flaw. - Although I like the story, I get the feeling they interrupt the game too much to talk. I mean, all the time. Sometimes I wished they would just shut up and let me play already, especially when I'm just repeating the mission and have already read the damn dialogue. All it does is having the player mash the A button until it is over. - I don't like the anime-style highschoolish 'I-have-big-boobs-but-I'm-chaste-and-innocent-please-fantasize-with-me' personality of some of the characters. I think it's juvenile. - Other than that, It's certainly a great game that deserves to be played.    "
 TL;DR
"great game, great plot and a lonley history about small heroes defending their home :3"
"Hands down one of the best games ive ever played, just buy it, i could point out some flaws of the gameplay, like how some of its mechanics is a bit exploitable and unbalanced, but the entire package wins out anyway. It's a japanese rpg game ported to the pc from the ps3 platform done in english version (but still has the japanese dub and va option), and it's a unique type of strategy turn based game that also implemets third person shooter type action, i played it and boom insta fav, addicted almost nonstop a week straight playing only this game.   The story is fantastic and the characters are as vibrant as it gets, also you get to manage your own squad as the lieutenant of your team, and you get to pick your own troopmates, each having it's own different classes, and upgrade their weapons and potentials, you also get to control tanks and stuff, so if you're a war gaming fanatic, then this is another reason for it to appeal to you and those type of audiences.  Overall rating it now: 10.5/10 yup, deserves it, lovin it, Vyse City OP!!"
"This game is great! Runs great on my 5 year old laptop with a 2.4Ghz C2D dual core and Mobility HD4670 1GB. At 1080p with vsync off there is a *slight* delay and lag. At 1080p with vsync on the delay is very noticable. So the game says requires a GTS 240 but will likely run on anything from the past 5 or 6 years that is not integrated graphics - at much reduced resolution. The game looks great despite it's age thanks to it's art design as well (2008 on PS3).  The game clocks in at nearly 21GB. That seemed ludicrous to me, thinking it was just an RPG. Even The Last Remnant didn't clock in but a little over half that. Now that I have played through nearly half the game I think the size is warranted. If you need some space check to see what you have installed you haven't played recently to make room for this awesome game.  It doesn't say anything about controller support and on the options page unless your controller is *currently* plugged in it won't let you select controller controls. After learning the game did in fact support a xbox360 controller from a friend who was playing it I found it worked beautifully! The one thing that irked me is the left and right on left stick are by default reversed. I noticed it the first time I went to setup my controller so luckily it did not affect me.  Keyboard and mouse controls work perfectly with one exception. The tank. Took me THREE tries to finish the first mission with the tank. It is very hard to control because it does not have a 0 turning radius and if you bump into the smallest thing in many cases the tank will stop. Don't even think of trying to control the tank while backing up! To control the tank DO NOT use keyboard controls except to push forward, SLOWLY move the mouse left and right to turn while moving or release the forward button and aim the mouse where you want to turn and the tank will slowly turn to face forward. If you use a controller tank control is far less effort and bumping into things is much less likely.  The gameplay is a demi tactics, 3rd person game. You get a set number of command points(CP) per turn. You may activate any unit as many times as youwant as long as you have CP remaining, however each activation past the first will result in a futher Action Point(AP) reduction. In a normal tactics game units can move AP number of tiles, in this you take control of the unit in 3rd person view. You get one attack per activation and if a unit comes into line of sight and range of a unit the enemy will reaction fire back - continuously.  The other half of the game is the story. I said 21GB is justified. If you rush through the game probably half your time will be spent watching the CGs between each mission. Everything is voice acted as well, even checking the page to level your unit's classes will have a sargeant yelling 'YOU MAGGOTS HAD ENOUGH' or similar. You also have a choice of ENG or JAP voice acting.   Final result - I absolutely love this game! If you like RPGs and tactics games, this is a must play!"
"Amazing visuals, gameplay, music, and story. Get it."
"Man this game is brutal. I still don't understand why I can't kill a trooper or lancer in a single shot with using armor penetration TANK raunds. Well at least head shot with 83 mm anti armor shot can be an instant kill if the shot will land on target. So yeah tank shots can miss the target even in the 10 meter radius which happens a lot if you try to hit infantry. Other than this game is really good. Good story, Lovable characters. Challenge in the game can get little bit unfair but overall this game delivers fun exprience"
really good port. took me 36 hrs to finish the main story. really good storyline. found the game very hard. will probably never touch it again i just played for the story. 6/10
" This game really does show a lot about how war can change everything. For a game that takes place in European World War II so much happens in that span of time. Losing family members and soldiers that are close to you and others is heartbreaking. Gallia and the Empire have been in war for quite a bit but yes Gallia does win the war (Spoiler Alert). Our main characters Welkin and Alicia really do learn more about each other as they fight through war and start to create their own relationship between each other but Welkin creates the Squad and Squad 7 is born and on their way to stop this war once in for all and get their hometown back again Bruhl.  As for gameplay goes, this game can be very strategist because you really need to think about who you send out for Operations and how you will carry out your plan to win that Operation. The combat system is pretty simple but all Soldiers gain more power as they level up with experience and find more guns to upgrade. And the tank Edelweiss is your only tank that you will need to use and protect and upgrade that's until you met Zaka who is also a Tank Commander and you will have two tanks to use and upgrade.  This game has a great story and it's soundtrack is wonderful as well. Strategist games really do help me think about my actions more so I don't make stupid moves. A great game but also hard as well if you don't know what you're doing.  I'll rate it 8/10.  "

Only complaint as a competent gamer is that I can't 360 no scope or tell the enemy things about their mothers that they never want to know. 10/10
"It's a great game, i recommend u guys should try it"
"This is the best port of anything since Grand Theft Auto IV, just buy this game already."
"Is this a good game?   Yes.   The combat is a hybrid of tactical turn based strategy and over the shoulder shooting action, though I consider the latter to be something of a formality. Yes you can run your character around but all soldiers stop firing at you when you take aim and the game uses a random number generator to determine whether you hit or not, so it's not like twitch reflexes play much of a role. Still, it's nevertheless certainly a lot of fun and decently challenging (though at no point will it ever reach the challenge levels of XCom).  Now, some of the game mechanics are certainly dodgy. Cover is pretty broken for instance. Sandbags provide a defensive bonus no matter which direction you're shooting from. Lying down in the grass confers basic invincibility until you toss a grenade at the guy to make him stand up. So basically we can say that the cover system is made by a rather shameless Imperial Guard player. And the Scout class is sort of better than all the other classes. But none of these flaws are dealbreakers and it is immensely satisfying to bring down an enemy tank column or cut down enemy infantry with well-orchestrated tactics.   If you're a fan of the tactical turn based strategy genre, you will find much to like here certainly.   The problem however is the story, which the game hammers you over the head with no matter how much you want to skip it. It's this sickly sweet war romance that uses pretty much every anime cliche in existence. It also wants to teach kids a Valuable Lesson about racism by making it so that the people with black hair are a minority or something. I don't want to go into great detail about it (see my screenshots if you want that) but it's a demonstrably awful storyline that will grate on your nerves as you slog through cutscene after cutscene to get to the next battle.   This thing was written right smack in the centre of that 2008-2011 period for anime, where the industry was sort of exhausted and spinning its wheels as it tried to figure out where to go after the greats of the aughts (Geass, Seed, the tsundere animes, etc) came to a close. It's a story with no ideas of its own that relies entirely on other (better) series for all of its material. It's honestly a little pathetic.  But that said, as the game goes on I challenge you not to get attached to at least some of the cheesy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Certainly not the main characters, who are completely awful, but the side characters certainly. Like Marina the sexy sniper girl who hates everyone. Or Walter, the middle aged rocket dude with self-esteem issues.   But yeah, do you like tactical games? Can you put up with one of the worst anime plotlines of the last decade? If your answer to both those questions is yes, then VC is the right game for you."
Good strategy game and good story
"If you like anime and history, then this is one title you must get."
"Do I recommend this game? You bet your ♥♥♥ I do. This game is brilliant in so many different ways that at many points in the game I found myself verbally reaffirming my love for this game to my housemates. There will be spoilers ahead but I shall mark them like so SPOILER    blah blah blah    SPOILER so there you go.  What first got me interested in the game was it's interesting combat, I mean, it's a turn-based, real-time, strategy, third-person shooter. I cannot describe the game in a simpler manner then this because it is all of these things. It's just such an odd concept that I had to give it a go myself and you know what it actually works really well.  -So, running through what I have said, it's turn based as you and your opponent take turns, you get CP (Command Points) to move your units around and do things, once you use all of them, or some of them as you can save your CP for your next turn if you think you'll need them, then it is the enemies turn and the same thing happens.  -It's real time because when you use your CP on a unit the game changes from a top down map to a third person perspective of the unit you have selected and then you decide what that character does from there, everyone has a selected amount of AP that they have to move and then they can take an action, shooting, healing, throwing a grenade SPOILER   using a flame thrower/grenade launcher   SPOILER, etc. And you'd think that that kind of thing may not work but it does surprisingly well in fact. -It's also an RPG because there are levels to your troops. There is so much going on here...  I'm going to talk about the story till the end and I'll run through some other things first.  Graphics- I love the artistic style of this game, it has that hand-drawn feeling while being fairly polished as a game. You can see in the characters shading what seems to be pencil lines and there is later on SPOILER   you get smoke rounds for your tank and when you put a soldier into their the game looses most of it's colour but takes on a beautiful pencil like quality that I loved so much.   SPOILER. There are some problems with the graphics however, the lip sync isn't the greatest but most of the time unless you were looking for it then you won't notice it, some of the character animations just don't work, like your engineers who can dismantle landmines with what seems to be a bolt cutter, which is magic because the same one can heal a tank, rebuild a sandbag wall and rebuild a tower, it's crazy really. Nevermind about that I'm rebelling now. Everything in this game is beautiful really, it's weaponry, the tanks, the characters all are individual, it's just a very pretty game being honest.  Difficulty level, it's a fun game, being honest I played it on normal, the highest you can go for your first run through the game, and there were points where I really thought that I had done goofed, but besides the few landmine incidents and failed suicide runs to get behind a massive tank with, what I can only describe as, an rpg in the shape of a lance, like the ones knights used to use, the game seemed pretty easy to get through, now I am in no way saying I got an A rank on every mission, but I did well, no permanent deaths, no missions where I rage quitted, though there was one I came very close to doing so, so it was a fun experience, going to be interesting to play on the harder difficulties...  Squad 7 - Squad 7 is your squad, it contains 20 people out of a possible 52(including hidden characters), out of which you can deploy a max of 10 in a mission, now you must be wondering why have the other 10 if you are not going to use them, but these are your reinforcement, if someone get's knocked out in combat you get your loyal medic to extract them and then you have to put another person into the fray, so it's a good idea to have backups of every member type.  Fan service - Oh I wish I could leave this out of my review and I could do it too as to get to this it's gonna cost you 50'000dcts and it isn't required for game completion(You'll need to do it if you are going for all the achievements though) nor story progression. There is one instance of this happening and you know what by that stage I had fallen for this game so much that I didn't care. I mean I cringed for the entire thing but it really didn't lower the games quality for me, it's easily ignorable and it can just not be watched if you don't want to, I'll give you the tital of it if you want to avoid it, SPOILER   Squad 7's R&amp;R   SPOILER.   Okay story - I love the story so much. It's basically ww2/ww1 with Russia, I mean the empire, as the aggressors. You play, what basically is Switzerland who has massive deposits of ragnite, the mineral that is used in everything, from healing things to engines to explosives to streetlamps, everything. So you start in Gallia and you are immediately thrown into a bit of comic misunderstandings of identity, Alicia, the main female protagonist thinks the main protagonist, Welkin, is a spy. Bit of endearing comedy, the situation is resolved when Welkins sister Isara, clears up the problem. Then your border town is a attacked by the empire and Welkin is thrown into a war he is not expecting and a man dies in front of him. You are forced to abandon the town you've lived in all your life and run. Then it's an emotional ride from here to kingdom come all the way to the end, there are scenes that nearly had me in tears, and the epilogue, wow, just wow. The story is just some of the best story telling that I have ever seen in a game. There are a few story arcs including multiple main characters and they are all as interesting as the others. I can't give you any more information before I start treading into spoiler territory. To give you the proper effect of the scenes that got to me I'd have to tell you every little bit of character dialog just for it to have the best effect.  There is one thing that got to me, just, bloody landmines, you will grow a hatred toward landmines like a cat to a dog. They can almost one-hit KO any team member so just avoid them or drive your tank across them.  Hint - SPOILER   Get your scouts and stormtroopers to level 11 as fast as you dare, then you get flamethrowers and grenade launchers.   SPOILER"
"  What an amazing game! The anime and soundtrack are beautiful, and the story blows you away. It's so well made. I never thought I would enjoy an anime game this much (animes aren't really my cup of tea). I got really attached to the characters and couldn't do anything else in the same day than playing the game. It's so addictive, you just want to keep playing more and more, and when the game is over you still want more and more. Such a shame the 2 sequels were PSP-exclusive though, it's about time they make one for PC players. It also has turn-based combat mixed with third person, which is very interesting. It's just brilliant."
"Plays like a SRPG in a 3d-enviorment. And, yes, looks like an anime movie. Basically the story is kind of world war 2ish, and brings up horrible events like the concentration camps and the crimes of the nazis... and the people Darcen feels like they represent the jewish people. But anyway, the story was deep and good, and I really enjoyed it.  9/10 game, if you enjoy SRPG´s."
Amazing game !! While playing the prologe I almost gave up on it. But after getting through that it turned into a amazing game ! Really recomend it to anyone who enjoys turn based combat !
Just for the record - an absoletely gem of the game
Great game.......  If you like X-com and you can look past its anime thid is a great game lots of fun  I dont need to say more just read the other players   10/10
"For a game that seems to think its narrative is important enough to constantly bombard you with cutscenes (albeit very pretty ones) both the plot and characters are woefully shallow.  The battle system looked like it has promise, but it is meshed with a reward and XP system all about finding cheap ways to rush one scout directly to the enemy base without actually using any squad tactics or teamwork (for maximum rating and rewards).  It helpfully provides battles you can grind to “catch up” on XP and cash.   Overall the whole thing felt like it had no respect for the time I was spending with it - grinding, arbitrary battle elements and endless exposition (sometimes even in the middle of a battle you had to watch 4 cutscenes to get too…)"

"An utterly fantastic game from start to finish. Combines gameplay seen in the third-person shooter and strategy genres, with the strategy side heavily influenced by games like XCOM.   In a fashion similar to XCOM, all characters are unique in identity and personality. However, if a unique soldier is killed and you do not rescue them within three turns, they are permanently gone for good. I find this to be a fair balance in comparison to games like Fire Emblem, as it promotes less save-scumming (which you can do anyway in battles, but it's just less fun that way).  The graphics are timeless due to the exclusive CANVAS engine developed for this game, and is a fantastically optimized port to boot. People have been saying that an Intel HD 4000 can run this game at 720p at 60 fps! The gameplay is not affected much by framerate anyway, and can easily be played at an FPS of 30, but damn, this game looks very slick at 60.  Music is one of the biggest positives of this game. The score is nothing less of stellar and is a major achievement for the composer, Hitoshi Sakimoto. Listen to one of the tracks for battling as a sample:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOKYKid2uPg   The controls are completely fine with mouse and keyboard (although I used a gamepad a few hours in) with the exception of menus not being mouse enabled. This is nothing too horrible because aiming in-game and the unit selection map screen uses the mouse instead.   This game also includes all four dlc's that were released years ago on the PS3.  I fully recommend you play this game. It is one of my favorite games of all time, and even if you hate games that look slightly like anime, go for it. This is anime war where people seem more happy than usual, but at the same time stuff can get pretty grim and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by tackling controversial themes at points.    AND WHEN YOU BEAT THE GAME PLEASE DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AND BE VERY CAREFUL AND SAVE YOUR GAME (I didn't so I have to beat the final boss again)"
Great game. Fun gameplay and a good story. Might be one of my favourite games now. I highly recomend it.
"TL:DR 6/10 - slightly better version of an otherwise crappy anime. A bit too difficult with no real reason other than sadistic tendencies of a developers. Recommended on sale only.    Summary:  Decent story, much better than original anime. Heroes are a bit more likeable, where in the anime they were totally 'meh'. Game version feels a bit like half the quality of story in final fantasy 5, but there are some plotholes as big as your momma - main hero is a son of war hero living in a small village, female main toon is a city militia and a baker in the same village. She doesn't know or recognise him when he gets back home, taking him for a spy. This is instantly nonsensical, but it gets slowly better till another event destroys it completely (main hero friends shoots female hero to activate her hidden powers that save an army. main hero instead of being shocked by new powers and glad for saving his sorry ♥♥♥ goes aggro towards his friend).     Graphics  is pretty, in my opinion this is one of better looking games in the market and has a tons of cutscenes, which are unfortunatelly interrupted by extremely poor missions.   Sound  is passable. No music to speak of, voices of some toons are very nice 'bang bang baby!' or 'you are sooooo over!' :)   Some characters are memorable more than the others, but apart from that only 5 are considered story-relevant.    Missions  are the utter rubbish, with a difficulty level well above anything modern players are used to.  But it gets worse - you are placed against enemies that are immune to your fire or who can one-hit kill you while spraying bullets like from machine gun. This is all by design and there is very little tactics involved in battles.  This creates a sense of pressure as the only way to win most missions is to get the only proper squad with proper equipments and then follow guides found over the internet.   Save often. Apart from stacking odds against the player game also features randomnes in attacks - you may hit all 3 shots or miss all 3 of them. Also missions can be pretty boring.  Tactical game mechanics is basically the worst part of this game. It is worse than anything you can probably think of.  Hence the total score is 6/10 - if you are patient or willing to use CE this might make your life much simpler and you will be playing this game for a story line (which is good ). "
"Its a turn-based shooter where your soldiers dont miss if you shoot at close range!  Eat that X-Com. And its Anime, where a guy rides a tank faster, coz he loves nature."
Great game
"One of the best strategy games, hands down, mature story, loved it."
World War 2 with a anime storyline
Having trouble with a tank that is pushing forward. Brings Jann (The one gay guy) into a group of males. Jann gets so excited that he 1 shots the tank. Gj Jann.  Best game 10/10
A typical VC playthrough: -Choose a waifu/husbando -Send waifu/husbando to combat -Waifu/husbando dies -Uninstall VC -Reinstall VC -...?
"If I could give this game a kiss on the cheek, I would give it two."
"I did not own a PS3 and thus the announcement of this game did not excite me much at first. However, after reading several reviews about it, I decided to give it a try. Firstly, the art style is extremely innovative and charming. The in-game graphics options, while lacking, are certainly existent and useful. The game has dual-audio functionality and this was one of the best features for me.  The gameplay which seemed shallow at first, developed into something way better and becomes quite challenging a few chapters in. The strategy elements are definitely way better handled than the Fire emblem series and similar SRPGS. The characters however, are quite one-dimensional and not written in any exemplary way.  All in all, I'm extremely happy that SEGA decided to bring this one to PCs for the western market. Hopefully, this sets a precedent for other Japanese developers to release their games on PC!"
"OH MY GOD SO MANY CUTSCENES!!!  Fun gameplay hidden beneath a LOT of cutscenes. If you like your anime stories and/or cutscenes then this is for you, if you just want a neat strategy game that's a little unique then this game might just drive you mad as you try to get to it."
Probably one of the best strategy games I've ever played. Loved when i had it for the ps3 had to get it the remasted version!!!
"Great game that combines turn-based strategy and real-time actions. Never played a game like this before and absolutely loved the mechanics. Storyline was not very intruiging, but interesting and nice to follow. Each level was quite different, it did not feel repetitive and there were some with a very creative twist. Personally, also loved the graphics and method they were drawn. Definitely recommended if you like strategy games and prefer turn-based, the real-time addition is a nice touch."
My little armed revolution cant be this moe
Can look under the skirt 10/10
"Tactical turn based combat set in an alternate 1930s 'Europe' with anime styling and tropes.  A fairly deep set of  - tactical choices  - leveling mechanics  - purchased upgrades - character specific bonuses make this game's turn based combat compelling.  The story is cliche, and the graphics are jarringly simple for 2008. A few repetitve animations can become annoying as the game doesn't limit how often you see them.  Overall - a solid tactial combat game."
"didnt think i would like tihs game as much as i did,i love my anime but this truely brought it to life,gameplay is smooth easy controls and awesome animaiton.highly recomended for fans of turn based combat,awesome game,...sorry i can not spell to save myself! :)"
10/10   Marina's spaghetti arm might be spooky at first but you sort of get used to it
"VC is a great experience, and I'm glad the port to PC was so good because I'd been eyeing it for a long time from afar. Good music, good strategy and to an extent challenge, good character and machine designs, great original fantasy WWI/II setting, gorgeous art direction and style that honestly I'd be okay with other games aping- It's not an accident that this did so well on steam.  There are negatives, too- the tone of the narrative is pretty inconsistent and basically childish, especially in the extra missions, a lot of the later conversations are cringeworthy and the antagonist might as well marker 'evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥' on their face. There's not a heck of a lot of subtlety, at any rate. Some of the missions kind of suck or drag (There's a pretty strange difficulty curve here), or aren't clear on what you're doing until you've played it a few times to know. Once you undestand rankings are based almost purely on speed and that spending all of your CP on orders for one person is usually ridiculously viable the game may lose some of that great strategic element. A lot of the upgrade options aren't really options, like the mortar lances that you should pretty much never ever use.  The flaws, however, are minor compared to the novel strategy and action hyrbrid systems, the underused setting and aesthetic, the satisfying headshot 'clunk' noises when you don't screw it up, and the wonderfully exaggerated ragdolling when your characters are shot down. The main characters are probably likable enough, and as offputting as it is it's also kind of great in a corny way to have the main heroine flash a smile and pump her fist each time she ends someone's life- which she will be doing a lot.  Speaking of which, the many characters you control have a pretty good spread of voices and eccentricities. The positive and negative qualities like fear of heights or working better when far from the group help give them personality beyond being Engineer # 6. although most of these being negatives or more trouble than they're worth could have been worked on a bit.  At any rate, Valkyria Chronicles is the kind of game I'd probably try to complete sometime despite the backlog. Good on sega for bringing this to steam- too bad the newest developing title in the series looks like it might kill it."
"I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS GAME, for my squad, for best possible outcome; i restarted missions millions time and have no regret in the end getting A rank in my first walkthrough. Every mission has trick (Can enjoy or can rush up to u). I forget everything when i am in this game. I shall now proceed to my final mission."
well i read that its fire emblem with guns and definitely its fire emblem with guns 10/10 buy it. Sega does what nintendont.
One of the best RPG games i've ever played.
"Fantastic game with a great story that I did not expect. I'm not a big fan of tactical JRPGs and some of the maps were a bit tedious, but overall I don't regret buying and playing through the game. I realize this game is about war and violence but I didn't expect many of the events to be handled so well or hit as heavily as they did. It's certainly still corny in some places, but I really couldn't find much about the story that I didn't like.  I would recommend giving this title a shot, especially if it goes on sale."
Its XCOM but in the 1930's with squads of waifus and nazis
This game is very good. ♥♥♥♥ing buy it
"It's really fun, never really played anything like it."
The game is awesome. That's all you need to know
"Nice scenario, gameplay, artwork and story"
"Great!   Someday Sega will port the PSP ones too.  Oh who am I kidding, they aren't that generous."
"X-com, but RNGesus has downgraded from 'actively trying to kill you' to 'wants to kick you in the nuts super hard'"
"Do you like turn based strategy games? Do you like rolling up on mofo's who don't think you have a tank when guess what you have a tank? Then this is the game for you!  No but for real this is a game I knew nothing about for years then it popped up in an episode of Unskippable and then it popped up in a recommended for me in steam.  Lets get something straight if you don't like turn based strategy games move on if you are like me and can't get enough of all of em again this is the game for you. It mixes it up by swapping from a map view to you pulling in third person and running them around the map and aiming manually. It's more forgiving than say Fire Emblem or Xcom when it comes to damage and death. If some one gets downed and you can run and touch them you can medivac them out with no repercusion, unless they are in a tank it's hard to recover from being in an exploded tank.  But it's not with out challenge espeacially if you aim to s rank all the mission's like a sadist.   Story wise I love it, the character's are great and diverse and learning more about them makes them more effective in the field undercertain conditions. Like say not putting you closterphobic engeneer in a trench where their accuracy goes to ♥♥♥♥, grummble.  Also holy ♥♥♥♥ it's pretty, not your standard run of the mill bloom filled anime looking thing but more of a handdrawn pencil aesthetic."
"This game is very unique! I never played anything like it.   pros: + The storyline/plot(did not beat the game yet but 6 hours in made it interesting to me). + The gameplay is unique. + The soundtrack in this game is nice. + The anime graphics may be a bit old but the gameplay and storyline makes this game shine!  cons: + The graphics in this game are old.  To come to a conclusion, this game is great. The unique gameplay, storyline, and soundtrack got me interested in this game. I recommend others to buy it. "
"Short and sweet; best PS3 exclusive--oxymoronic, yeah--ever comes to PC in pristine condition, is an incredibly tactical, fun and accessible now thanks to extremely low system requirements(720p 30fps on the Thinkpad--HD3000&amp;I5-2520m)."
"The best gameplay, the best story and the best graphics.  I even bought a PSP to play VC II and III. :')"
"This IS the spiritual successor to Final Fantasy Tactics. The music and feel of this game are very tactics-esque, so that hits home with me already.  I'm not too far into this game yet, but I can already give it the incredibly accurate score of 9.79/10.   If you like XCom and FFT, you will enjoy this."
"This is a great game for strategy RPG fans like myself. Several years ago, I fell in love with turn-based strategy RPGs like the Fire Emblem series, and Final Fantasy Tactics, and this game is quite similar to those. So if you like them, you'll probably like this. There is a core of main characters who you'll end up taking in to battle pretty much every time, because of their benefits (and the fact they're some of the best units out there), but there's also a wide range of other characters you can take into battle too, who all have their own strengths and weaknesses.   Valkyria Chronicles has a great blend of what I think of typical strategy RPG, with a grand continent-wide-war story, but also just the the gameplay itself, but it also incorporates a good action-style shooter type gameplay as well. When you take part in a battle, each turn you first get the 'Command View', where you can see a top-down-view rough map of the area, as well as where you're units are located on that map (represented by symbols), as well as any enemy units you know the location of (ie, one of your units can see them). When you select a unit to move them, you go into an over-the-shoulder 3rd person view, where you actually run the unit around the map and can then line up and fire a shot at an enemy unit before ending their turn. It was a little strange at first but I quickly became used to it and it's a great mechanic, allowing you to see both the strategic view a commander would have of a battle, but also the more personal view from each soldiers view point. It's great that even when you're controlling a unit, sometimes enemies can pop out of a hiding place in the grass etc. and surprise you, so it's great that you get to relate to each of your characters like that, and take care with how you move them, rather then just seeing them as chess pieces. The missions get increasingly difficult too, and there were some that required quite a lot of thinking and planning!  The storyline is fairly typical, focusing on a group of characters in the Gallian militia, fighting off the evil Empire troops ivading their homeland. It's set in a sort of Alternate Universe version of Europe, called Europa. For me, there weren't many real surprises in terms of the story telling, but it was still really gripping, and there were some shocking moments still. The characters were quite well fleshed out as well, and some of them were really entertaining.   Overall, this is a great game if you like strategical games, and I think it's action-style element will be a refreshing change for veterans of the the genre, but could also help bring in newcomers too. I've sunk quite a lot of hours in to this game, and started a new game plus as soon as I finished it, telling you how gripping I've found it. At the time of writing I've spent about 50hrs playing the game, and I think about a good 45 of them were on the first playthrough, the remaining 5ish will be on my new game plus. Overall, Valkyria Chronicles is a really great, engaging and gripping game, and well worth a play. I've heard that they made at least 2 other games in this series, and I really hope they make it to Steam too!"
"First time I saw Valkyria Chronicles was about in 2008, where it was released for PS3, but never got its name. Luckily after 6 years without knowing it, I saw that it was coming to Steam. The pictures, the looks, the strategy, they all looked the same.   I bought it.  And without regret either.  This game is simply put: Amazing.   Why? You may ask. Well, VC is extremely well done, even the port is extremely well done. It has a strong story (for me that is... dunno about you), there is progress among our main characters, visual upgrade to the equipment, matching music for combat and cutscenes and best of all: Strategy (as in third person turn-based game). VC requires you to know when you should, and shouldn't attack, because: if you bluntly go directly into combat, then wave goodbye to your soldier! Honestly, I haven't played such a good game for a long time... Although the game has about 30-40 hours gameplay (which is short for some people), it offers a lot.  I tell you this: You like story, use of your brain to when and how, this is what you ought to buy.  This I personally give a full 10 / 10 for being Amazing with a big A."
"Originally described to me as 'anime xcom', it's not quite exactly the case. Comparing it to XCom, Valkyria Chronicles has less tactical strategy (no overwatch/less attack options, less customizable character loadouts, less 'home-base' decision making), but instead VC places a much stronger emphasis on the storyline, where you follow an episodic route. Unlike X-Com there's main characters that actually have personalities, and you'll probably feel quite attached to them over time. There is still xcom-esque strategy present with the presence of 5 different classes that all feel necessary, and you can upgrade them at will depending on your playstyle.  The graphics style is charming, like something taken straight out of an anime, and all anime fans would be encouraged to play this. The soundtrack is also pleasant. I played the game with Japanese voices &amp; English subs, but I heard the English voice dub is just as good. Oh, did I mention that the voice actor for Lelouch voices a main character?  9.5/10 well worth your money"
Greatest game I have ever played. 12/10
"Where to start? This game is outstanding. If you're a fan of tactics-based games, you'll almost definitely love it. There are very few bugs/glitches, (And the devs seem determined to find workarounds for them..) and only a few of the mechanics could cause you any grief. (An example: The times when an enemy trooper drops prone and dodges all your bullets. But this is balanced by the times your own troopers do the same thing to the enemy!)  The story is enthralling, the graphics are, well, anime-in-3D but still well done. Well worth the price. Looking forwards to the sequels being brought to PC as well!"
Excellent port of an excellent game. Only minor gripe is that the prerendered cutscenes have jaggies and AA can't be forced. It says a lot about the game and the port when that's the only flaw I can find. Now just hope the rest of the serious makes it to Steam.
well worth it
"Imagine that you are reading a book. The visuals are bright, but somewhat washed-out, almost like a watercolor.   This book is written by a woman author from just prior to the Great War, emulating the jingoistic stories of duty, honor, and glory that filled the heads of young men off to war. Then the horror of burning metal, smashed buildings, and broken lives. Yet in this carnage is humanity.  Babies are born, flowers bloom, and friendships far deeper than any experienced in peace are forged. Like Ersnt Junger's 'Storm of Steel', excitement and glory can also be found in the horrors of modern conflict.  Complex, yet sincere, this game is an excellent introduction not only to war stories, but JRPGs in general. My own son (of 11) has started his own games to see the story for himself."
"This game was clearly meant to be an anime. Clearly.  It has what I like to call the 'Metal Gear Syndrome'; an expansive plot that had a lot of work put into it which is detailed through long cutscenes and in-game files. The creators of Valkyria Chronicles didn't just create a plot to carry the game, they made it the centerfold and filled the concotion more than halfway with it before adding in the 'gameplay' itself.  Initially I wanted to get to the missions themselves and grew a little aggravated with how much plot there was. Around chapter 6 I came around though, and towards the end I found myself wanting to get PAST the missions to see more of the story. Your enjoyment of this game is going to depend on your enjoyment of the plot, since it takes up so much of each chapter's time. Plus, there are game files that are gradually unlocked and either add to or explain the game's lore/developments. You don't have to read them, but they do help, and there are a LOT of them.  Story was decent. I thought it was going to be more political in tone and play on wartime international politics, but it winds up being about an ancient race of people (the Valkyrur) and a prince's race to claim their strength for his own ambitions. Meh, kinda simplistic but it plays out well and is paced remarkably good. Nothing is daunting and information unfolds steadily-this is how you craft a comprehensive plot and unfold it at a pace that ensures gamers are grasping all information relayed. The characters are also solidly crafted and don't fall into the typical anime tropes you'd expect. If you have prejudices against the artstyle then rest easy, no one asks if Senpai noticed them.  The only criticism I have is in how war is sometimes portrayed. The reaction both sides display (at different points in time) when materials banned in treaties are used in warfare is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's as if this game came from a nation that has no standing army and attitudes of what warfare actually entails are really, really, really naive.  Seriously, sometimes the game comes off as incredibly naive and almost childish. 'The soldiers on the other side have families too!' no ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥. It's not often, and it isn't that big of a deal, but I did groan a few times when it did occur. Just a small mark, though.  As for the game itself, it's coo, it's cooooo. I can't say how it ranks in the strategy RPG genre, since this is my first such title. What I can say is that its pretty good on its own merits, but the challenge starts dropping off towards the end.   You have 5 classes that are levelled up with XP points attained after completing missions, with the amount given depending on how quickly you finish the mission (in terms of turns, not time). You level up the class, not individual units. Levelling up a class gives you more health for every unit, with 'potentials' unlocked as you continue to level up. Potentials being inherent abilities within each individual unit that vary. Shocktrooper A might be able to attack twice per turn, whereas Scout C might gain the potential to increase the potency of your healing item. Honestly, I didn't pay much attention to potentials, since they occur randomly in battle and very few of them can be 'controlled'. The real control comes in 'orders' that are gained when you hit certain levels for each class. They cost you movement points each turn, but they range from increasing evasion to decreasing damage sustained from intercepting fire as you move across the map.  This is where the game starts becoming easy. You can pass the Bruhl reclamation storyline mission in one turn, with one unit. Perhaps it has more to do with proper balancing of some of the orders rather than an inherently easy game. There's also the reality that replaying a map is much easier since you're familiar with where the enemy is and what awaits you. But it still shouldn't be possible to pass a mission with one unit in one turn, complete information or none at all. Alicia, one of the storyline units, becomes REALLY unfair towards the end. Story-wise I understand why, but it's so incredibly broken. She gets a chance to get a full heal after attacking, and a chance to double her movement points. With the 'caution' order she can literally run across a field with tanks, troopers with machine guns, and all sorts of mayhem and survive. It's RIDICULOUS.  I know of one other mission where you can pass it in one turn by using cheap tactics, but there are probably more. They would've done well to balance some of the orders (well, just two, 'caution' and 'unlock potential') and Alicia. That being said, it's still an enjoyable game with the later maps initially presenting a challenge due to your unfamiliarity with them. It's a shame the difficulty drops off later on, but the plot picks up. So it's a give and take. The upside is that the difficulty only comes down after one of the hardest missions, so I guess it isn't a total loss.   But enough about my ♥♥♥♥♥ing, I enjoyed the game and that's all that matters."
"Great Game, but there are some huge flaws.  Playing Valkyria chronicles is like seeing the best Dancer in the world dancing with an iron cannonball attached to a leg.  The game has so many great things.  Graphics are good, the Story is good, soundtrack is fantastic and the gameplay is great.  The big problem of the game are the winstates. Most maps are won by capturing a Flag X in the enemy basecamp.   The problem with this is, that the game rewards not to be a good general, but a fast General. There were endless situations where the logical solution would have been to go around the enemy and hit them from the back, but that would have needed one more turn and a worse mission rating. The game often forces you to use suicide tactics to capture the flag as fast as possible. This often also leads to endings where 'winning' doesn´t feel right, because half the map is still full of enemies but to get the best rating, speed runs to the enemy flag are often necessary.  Because speed is so important, half of the soldier types in the game become useless for most missions (apart from some special missions where normal tactics don´t work) since scouts are so much more superior to all other classes. Thats especially sad for the tank which in most missions is just standing arround, because moving him costs far too many Command points.  Its like a shooter where you are given the best weapon in the second mission and there is no improvement in picking other weapons.   Its a real shame. If the game would rate the mission on soldiers killed or wounded. plus enemies killed PLUS a sort of Time limit as another factor, it would be so much better."
"This is the first review I have ever written for a game. But in my mind, Valkyria Chronicles is worth the accolades. I had originally mistook Chronicles for Valkyrie Profile, a game I was mildly interested in for the DS. After looking into it, I saw the gameplay and was actually hesitant about whether I would enjoy this type of game. I bought it and have not regretted it in the slightest. The story immediatley draws you in. The game, though anime and childlike in many aspects, has an amazing cast of characters and in depth backstories for all of the characters. I look forward to the updated entries after each chapter to see what new info I could get on Catherine or the easter egg characters Vyse and Aika. The gameplay itself is phenominal, and while I wish I could crouch anywhere, I enjoy the blend of real time and turn based strategy. The music and artwork hold nothing back and the penciled sketch look of the game complete the bookish nature of the story. To anyone who enjoys a good story, an amazing soundtrack, attention to detail in both presentation and background informatiuon, lovable characters, and gameplay that will both frustrate and thrill you, this is the game for you."
"I ♥♥♥♥ing loved it. When I thought the game is nearing it's end, it wasn't even half finished. Great game, seriously.  10/10 'it's OK' -IGN"
"The game itself is one of the best strategy games I've played, and I say that as someone who isn't even much of an anime fan.  The reason I post is a giant port-specific caveat: 60 FPS is nice but it can cause issues.  I couldn't finish Marberry Shores EX in one turn for the life of me; I kept dying to interception fire from gatling turrets that never happened on the PS3. I figured it might be like Dark Souls where the framerate changes the timing for some things, and it was -- at 30 FPS the guns seemed to take roughly twice as long to track and begin firing and I completed the mission without issue. (and immediately re-enabled 60 FPS)  So if you see wonky stuff like that, try temporarily setting 30 FPS. You shouldn't need it for most of the game, but I doubt it's possible to one-turn Marberry Shores EX on 60 FPS.  And PS3 vets: Remember this comes with the DLC so don't forget to do the Selvaria missions first. After that it's Ruhmstein with Rosie."
10/10
"Great story, great gameplay, an absolutely worthwhile buy. If you are a fan of anything strategic, then this game won't dissapoint."
"Good story, nice tactic gameplay, beautiful art style. I like game ending in story and its music."
"One of my favorite games ever.  The story kept me coming back for more, but the best part of this game is the gameplay.  The turned based action is very fluent and even tho it is turned based it keeps that feeling of constant action while you run from cover to cover dodging bullets and eventually shooting people through the head. Every kill always felt satisfying and most of the time fair if one of yours were to fall down in combat, because I forgot to put my soldiers under proper cover or left them alone. Thinking ahead and having a great strategy/position is key.   Besides, this game's art is amazing. Visually it looks stunning and runs smoothly. Even on my potato. And it has good music, that sometimes amongs the battles every so often i caught myself just standing there listening.   The only real downside I experienced were the tank controls. Those can be kinda annoying from time to time."
Got this for cheap on sale. It's kind of a cross between XCOM and Final fantasy in a WWII alternate reality setting.   Pros: + Controls are OK for a console port. + Art style is cool. + Characters are cool. + 50% of the militia are women. + Can order your sister to drive your hybrid WWII tank around.  Cons: + More cutscene than gameplay.  + Sister is bad at driving.
"One of the best game I've played, I think that the 87 hours I played the game where totally worth the experience.  PD: Alice is so broken."
"The game is awesome so far from what I've played, you have to plan your actions strategically and it can be pretty unforgiving if you mess up."
"I was really hesitant to try this game because of very little medio coverage but I ended up picking it up after Totalbiscuit heartily recommended it even though he was doing a sega boycot. I must say I am impressed. This game is a very nice turn on the classic turn by turn tactical RPG. If you like shadowrun, wasteland 2, and X-com, you shoudl love this game. I also particularly like the anime style (because I   am   a fan of anime and manga).  However there are some thigns I can not accept. Having unbeatable bosses that are literally invincible have a huge stamina pool and one shot anyone they shoot at regardless of distance? NO. NO. and NO. that is so effing unnaceptable! especially when said boss appears  halfway through   the level! And you have to start teh whole level again every damn time! One of my most frustrating moments in gaming (alongside broken camera / long range sniper deaths in assassin's creed unity).  I still love the game though and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the genre. This is a purchase you wont regret."
"9/10 great story line amazing ending one of my favourite tacticle rpg gameplay might seem a bit repetitive but overall fun mid/end game events will seem tedious and frustrating, especially if your underleveled     dissapointed that the game wont allow me to play as an OP Valkria :'( :'(   "
"Great game.  Have the PS3 version, had to get the PC port.  Here's to hoping VC3 coming out to the States. And yes I do know about the fan translation."
Great game. Most definately looking forward to the second to come to PC.
"I allways thought I couldn't expect too much from an anime-based game, but VC has proven me I was wrong. As the years go by, Sega remains showing its talent as one of the best game developing companies. VC is a refreshing and very enjoyable gaming experience that doesn't dissapoint in any way.  There are a lot of things to qualify this game as AWESOME, I'll give it a 9 out of 10 and I'm only taking out 1 point because of the language, which only comes with Japanesse and English subs, so if you don't understand english well, better think twice before buying, because understanding what the game explains is very important to know what to do."
"Only 5 hours into this game and already LOVING IT! If you are a fan of JRPGs, Advanced Wars, or any turn based game (like FF Tactics) you will love this. Dialogue is stereotypically cheesy and goofy, but if you're used to anime or Japanese games dubbed into English, it's no different.   Giving a 9/10 for cheesy dialogue. 10/10 for very interesting and involved/deep gameplay."
"You have to press Start or Escape quite a bit to skip through all the terrible anime garbage. After you skip about 6 or so, you get to play your first mission. It seems this is how the rest of the game plays out as well, so get ready to skip all the awfulness before you get to play each time. It mind sound exhausting, but trust me - push on.  You can't skip the gameplay so don't worry about skipping EVERYTHING ELSE. Any plot you need to know is summarized before each battle. Once you make it there, you are rewarded with an awesome game that plays like a turn-based strategy with far more control than I've ever been given. I'm heavily reminded of Operation: Darkness with a little bit of X-Com: Enemy Unknown. You can move your players anywhere fluidly on the battlefield and the mechanics are easy to understand.  I really enjoy this game, but don't know why it's hidden inside some trite and boring anime."
"A tremendously enjoyable game, fun gameplay mechanics similar to that of xcom yet still very unique in it's own right also complete with a gripping narrative which compelled me to continue playing. I'm unsure what the replay value is as I've only just got through my first playthrough but the game does give you the option to start a new game with the unlocks you aquired in the previous game and I can see the appeal for perfectionists and achievment hunters to do so.   As previously stated the gameplay is similar to xcom where you move your units in turns however it also radically distincts itself as when you are controlling a unit the game enters real time as enemy units will shoot at you. At the begining of a turn you gain a number of command points which you use to move around troops and issue orders, often times you gain more cp than units so unlike xcom you can move one unit any number of times. The game features 5 unit classes and your tank commanders, these clases consist of Scouts, Shocktroopers, Lancers, Engineers and Snipers, All with varying strengths and weaknessess."
"What is Valkyria Chronicles? It's a turn based strategy, a third person shooter and a squad management simulator it one game. The plot that'll make you cry, and will interest you at the same time. Smooth graphics and good soundrack. Top game, top anime (you should probably watch it too), totally recommend 10/10!"
"Okay, so short version: Should you buy this game? Yes. Long version: Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best games I've played in some time, it has beautiful artwork, a fantastic story, and very good gameplay! I really love this game and I wish that the other games from the series, Valkyria Chronicles 2 &amp; 3 got ported to PC so that I could experience them.  However I do one have issue with it, despite the main characters being developed along the story we don't really get to know other members of Squad 7 unless you read the entries in the Personnel Tab, which tells us a bit about each character you meet along the way, which is quite saddening."
It's a lovely turn based strategy/story based game with a verry unique anime inspired hand sketched art style. persoally i might be a little bit biased because i loved the anime of valkyria chronicles so i am enjoying the game a lot.  if you are of have been a fan of the show or if you in general like a little bit more story in a turn based strategy game then i would recommend giving this title a go.
"This game is just TOO good. i remember way back in 2008 my brother had a ps3 and he bought this game for it, i remember looking at the cover and just saying 'meh, it looks alright' but as soon as i booted up the game and started playing i just could not put it down. and now it's on steam! Hallelujah!!"
"RIP Translation.....  just 30% of the translation that really good to read......   play english dub if u dont want to suffers with wrong translation .. use japanese dub and turn off the subtitle to lessen the suffering (hurts so bad seeing bad translation)  but the gameplay simple and fun, the Voice Actors are really good (especially alicia)"
"Holy ♥♥♥♥  This game is one of the best RTS's I've played. Now don't take my word for it, because I've only ever played Risk, Axis and Allies, Star Wars: Empire at War and an old one on the playstation 2, so I'm not very experienced on this genre. But I truly love RTS games, and this by far takes the position for favorite game for me.  Combining RTS with a decent story, a third person shooter and just a plain awesome gameplay experience, including amaing squad mechanics, weapon upgrading system and many other mechanics that are just amazing, including the 5 classes of squad members, this game is just great.  9.7/10. 11.7/10 with rice."
Simply an amazing game and a must have for any strategy game enthusiast.  Great art style Great story Great gameplay Great voice actors  Controls could do with a little tweeking but easy to get used to.  This is how ports should be done (take note WB)
"This Game Beatiful, Because:  -----------------------  Pros (+)  +Unique Story +Epic Gameplay +Epic Strategy +Great Graphic +Anime!  -----------------------  Cons (-)    In My Option, This Game Not Have a Cons :)    "
A steller game in all respects. Valkyria Chronicle was a great game for the ps3 and it still a wonderful game today. It's a great playing unique take on stategy games. The art style is lovely the music a nice complement. Anyone who's a fan of things like Orge Battle or other tactical games should really check this out. Also the best thing of all fear not this will literally run on everything.   My current pc is horribly outdated and im running the game at 2304x1440. I am however choosing to run at 30 fps to get this higher resolution.   My specs are as listed  Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit edition Pentium 4 3.2ghz Extreme Edition (Socket 478) 3GB DDR 1 400mhz  128GB PNY SSD His 4670 GDDR3 1GB Edition   If it can run on this chances are it will run on anything modern perfectly.
"Fitting that it was released on Steam on November 11th. Good game.  The graphics are different, in a very appealing way. The story is eventful and engaging and the battles are increasingly difficult. Fun, memorable."
Stormcloaks VS Empire: with guns
"I might be a bit different from everyone else...  I too LOVE this game. I have it for PS3 and was like 'hey, I like this game, it is 75% off. I'll play through it again on the PC.'  Sadly... I hated it on the PC. The controls were just aggrivating. It probably had to do with the fact I switch from a controller on PS3 to the keyboard on the PC. My guess is it would be much better with the steam controller.  I would still recommend this game if you never played it. You probably won't care about the controls since you aren't used to the PS3 controls. It has an amazing story and is truly unique."
"the best SEGA game on steam, and probably the only good thing that will come out by SEGA until Valkyria Chronicles 2 and Valkyria Chronicles 3 come to PC."
"Great port, no bugs so far, runs well in 4K. The gameplay is not boring and the missions are always varied. Try it if you like anime and tactical RPG. For less then 20$ it's a deal ! Don't listen to people saying it's a 'poor 3rd person shooter'. It's NOT a 3rd person shooter its a tactical game, you actually have to aim but the battlefield is frozen when you aim and your statistics are also a part of the damage done."
great game ! dont regret buying this game at all it has all i like a great story great characters and CONTROLLER SUPPORT!!!
Experience the horrors of war while playing as anime characters that laugh all the death and destruction off like its nothing. 10/10 would kill imperials again
"I don't think I've ever seen a combat system that is so teribly much based on rock paper scissors...handgrenade kills a scout, but does 5% dmg on a lancer. Shocktroopers kill heavily armored soldiers within 15 meters easily, but if they're 18m away, they only do like 3% dmg ?! This is ridiculous. Bottom line is, you exactly need to know in advance what's happening and what troops you'll need and where, or you won't stand much of a chance. Either be ready for some serious try-and-error or read a walkthrough before every mission.  The story itself is nice, and I like the idea of having extra skirmishes to level up, but the combat system is just a shame."
Interested? Just Do It No Regret :P
"Despite the weird anime story and the predictable plot, the game itself is an enjoyable text on blending third person gunplay with turn based strategy.   For those who want to know more about what the game is like: It's Fire Emblem with headshots."
Beloved SRPG once exclusive to the PS3 gets another chance on PC with a well performing and great looking port. All DLC is included.
"I wasnt planning on buying VC again here on Steam, I've logged over 200+ hrs on Valkyria Chronicles on the PS3, I even bought a PS Vita just to play VC2 (even better than VC1).   My jaw literally dropped when I saw VC on the Steam store page earlier this year. Finally! PC users who werent exposed to this console gem were in for an amazing treat. In my personal opinion Valkyria Chronicles was the best RPG/Tactical game released on the PS3, and one of my favourite games of all time. The art style is just stunning and really suits the atmosphere and presentation of the game.  COMBAT:  The combat system is unique and something that I very much enjoyed. It is turned based, you are given a specific amount of AP per round, generally 1 AP per turn but you are able to move freely for a limited time instead of x-amount of tiles or squares per turn. You are able to use line of sight and crouch or lie down for cover. There is an overwatch type system in place and you can get support fire from friendly units who are near by. Ofcourse the enemy can do all this as well and the A.I. on the PS3 wasnt too shabby.  Each class has is specific roles and compliment each other on the battle field, some classes neutralize each other in a rock/paper/scissors way. Finding the right mix of what class to fill out your squad with for each battle is also part of the strategy. Even more impressive is that depending on which characters are in your squad their class abilities can become enhanced with perks/skills specific to that character. Then there are commander battle orders you can use for a cost of AP that can effect the map in a variety of ways depending on which ones you've unlocked/learned.  There is a ton of relplayability with VC since you can go back and repeat missions previously cleared and take on some of the bonus EX extra skirmishes. These are great ways to level up your squad and gain materials for upgrading gear and weaponry.  THE STORY:  The cast of characters is large, espcially with your squad. Everyone has their own reasons for joining the war and each squad member has their own personal line of missions to complete. The personalities between squad mates is great, some mesh better with others and some negatively... so much so that it can effect the way things play out on the battle field for certain squad mates.  There are a lot of game companies that have done titles on war or great wars and generally leave it on the large scale end of things inregards to story telling and dont get to invested with the personal aspects of the struggles and horrors that war brings. VC does not shy away from this and even though the characters and events are fictional, the story touches on some sensative matters that few games in the war genre have.  The Valkyria Chronicles franchise is truly something special, the overwhelming number of positive reviews across the media prove this. If you are still on the fence about wether to purchase this or not, do yourself a favour and pick this up."
"Ingenious, well presented, visually and audibly appealing World War 2 JRPG. In a way, it's like a better Final Fantasy Tactics in a modern setting. Although the writing is a little dubious at times (oh hey guys, let's get out of the tank so we can show the newborn his destroyed village from a ~maybe~ safe distance).  The only bad thing I can come up with so far other than that is that the game disables player input during AI turns in combat, and oh boy does that ever take a while to resolve (cannot be accelerated either).   Nothing preserved bread won't fix, 9/10"
"If you love anime and turn based strategy games, you should definitely play this! :-)"
I like how Alicia is a baker. I would grab and eat her bread w/o question.
Now one of my favorite games! Battles are similar with heroes of might and magic 3 in some ways. I like it! I recommend it to every strategy game lover.
"Great game, you can see where they had a smaller budget then some other games, but they combat is satisfying, story is enjoyable. Well worth the price. Check out the game and enjoyable the crazy anime alternate ww2 story."
It's good!
"You know, I really like this game.... Its super good but and this is minor but the thid level in this game seems impossible! Im actually very mad at this, so unfair with only three units.... They expect too much for you in my own thoughts. But hey, maybe thats just my crappy strats with this new formate of a game. Other than my anger with this level XD Great game.. Buy it"
The story is great the art of the characters and visuals is just fantastic but the only anoying thing about this game is combat its is a well made rpg kinda thing but the combat some times might ♥♥♥♥ you of but like i got stuck in alot of places and the AI for your allies is very bad some times (when its enemys turn) sometimes when i choose the direction to shoot your character might some times shoot the wall if your hidding behind a wall and the fact where you need to be paciente in this game pisses me sometimes of because of not saving this game also does not have check points which is also annoying ALOT OF TIMES   so all i can say if you have good nerves and you like story games then buy this game its great!
"Not a bad game, very story rich, if you don't have nothing to do for a while try it, you'll put hours in before you realize it."
 Valkyria Chronicles is a game that you either love or you hate
"Definitely an amazing port from the PS3 as well as an amazing strategy game.   If you enjoy the Fire Emblem games, I think you'll enjoy this as well. I found it on sale for $4.99 which is a steal considering you get the main game PLUS all the released DLC. It's definitely story heavy as the game is broken up into chapters with around 6 or so parts to each chapter with only one of those being a battle.  From what I understand, it's loosely based off of WWII with a bit of a fantasy element to it as well. The story is amazing and the art style of the game is gorgeous. I thought originally that the 'cloudy' border was going to bother me, but it turns out that eventually I just tuned it out.  I was very on the fence about buying this game, but I'm SO glad that I did and would recommend it to any strategy game lovers.  Oh, and most of the story parts are fully voice acted. Which I absolutely love."
"One of the best strategy games I've played in a long time. You'll laugh, you'll get angry, you'll feel sad and you can have hours of content.   The story is amazing! I was always into it and I didn't see any problems with it.  The art style is like a book. It will, at first, throw you off with the paper-like boarding around the screen when moving a soldier, however, I got used to it. It might have gone away because I didn't even stop to think about it.  When playing this game, make sure to do the side missions a bit or you will loose a ton. The game is completely possible to beat without doing side battles, but you won't be having fun skipping a ton. Later game I didn't see much problem with it as I knew exactly what to look out for and I could upgrade my units for that. Oh and you will loose, you will loose a lot of late game missions. Just because you have to do a certain thing and you won't know til you loose. Maybe thats jsut me being bad at this game.  At the current price of $20, it would no be a bad buy if you are willing to sink the time into it. If it is on sale for even 10%, you should buy this! GET IT NOW"
"From a Fire Emblem and complete fan at tactical games... This game is fantastic!!! (Its like a WWII Fire Emblem) I did not have a Playstation 3 which means I did not know of this game until I read about it while playing as one of the characters in Project X Zone (don't judge me XD), so I went to check it out and to find out it was on steam. I was not dissapointed at all and got far more than my money's worth. The gameplay is fun and original. I love how important it is to place people and how crucial it is to have a proper matchup depending on the weapons class. I like that you get to play in third person shooter. The story is well developed and interesting which fits the characters in this game. The characters are fun and unique and I think its super cool that each person's personality and background affects their potentials in battle. I also love the sketch book water color art style which in its own way makes environments quite wonderful to look at. The one trouble I have with it is that the story seems to end too short and I can't get enough of this masterpiece. Also there are animation errors when it was ported. Like the eye patch floating around on the training instructor, or the detached arm on Maria, or the crown on Maximilian. I also wish I could skip or at least fast forward enemy turns that end up not attacking you. Though those minor errors is nothing to make me love this game less. I would recommend to anyone who wants a good"
"World War II European operations as understood by Japanese interns. Infinitely amazing. 10 out of freakin' 10.  XCOM gameplay in a setting technologically comparable to the 1930's with a good deal of steampunk and fantasy mixed in, and all of this presented in an anime style with a lot of (non-interactive) dialogue going on between missions. There is adequate depth to the tactical gameplay once you understand all the mechanics. The actual combat has a minor real-time component to it, so be aware this isn't purely a turn based game. Some grinding is recommended, but it didn't bother me. The world is delightfully fleshed out with lots of little snippets to read.   The writing is also painfully cliched at a times, but ultimately enjoyable. I applaud their decision to explore some mature themes that are generally avoided in mainstream games but, again, the quality of the writing often makes these attempts fall short. Then again I heard the English translation is kinda... weird, so maybe that's the cause.  Mouse support in gameplay but not in menus is a bit sad, but I guess we're lucky to get any at all. This seems to be par for the course when it comes to Japanese PC ports."
"Excellent turn-based action/strategy game. If you love oldschool turn-based RPGs you'll probably love this game. This game twists the old turn-based formula and makes units reactive outside of their turn, units attacking and counterattacking each other within a certain range. It really makes you plan your assaults.    That being said, there are only two real downsides for me.  1) Lots of cinematics between battles. Most of them are only 30 seconds to a couple of minutes long, but there are a lot of them. They set the story before battles.   2) This game is hard as balls if you're rusty on the strategy front, the tide can turn quickly for either side. You may find missions drag on until you get that one break in the enemy's defenses. It can be merciless, and you will lose units (permanently if you don't put another unit in danger to call a medic to the downed soldier).    Example: 3rd move into my turn, my scout turns a corner and just gets mowed down by a tank and two machine-gunners. He didn't stand a chance. If the enemy isn't in your line of sight their position and movements are unknown to you. Makes for some really hilariously bad situations.    Graphics: 10/10 - You can play in 1080p 60FPS  Audio/Voice Acting: 9/10 - A decent variety of voice actors, though some are a bit too quiet. There isn't much talking outside of the cinematics or radio chatter while on the battlefield.  Gameplay: 8/10 - Moving around some terrain is difficult with a mouse and keyboard. You clip edges of various things and get stuck, wasting a portion of your AP you need to move at all. However you can control the same unit multiple times (though with further reduced AP each time you control them) to advance them quickly. This helps to get machine-gunners and snipers with low AP caught up with the rest of your troops, at the cost of your command points each time. Plan accordingly  Storyline: 7/10 - The story is pretty neat. There's a lot of storytelling cinematics if you're into that. You may get annoyed by it if not."
Anime strategy game
"One of my favourite games from the PS3, I played it through atleast four times back then. From what I have played here so far this looks to be a perfect conversion. Has a good storyline with well developed characters and better voice acting than I have seen in some PC games from the last two years. I have seen some people complain that it has a too sunny view on war which I find laughable as just in the opening 5 minutes you see the Empire displaying racism and willing to shoot women and children. I will admit that it does not go into the extreme darkness that can be seen in war but this is a game and if it were too realistic no one would play it as it would be no fun.  You can easily play for pure fun and finish missions with a C or D grade but also you can choose to aim for B or even A grade and it is quite challenging and you will need your thinking cap to succeed.  Some of the PC controls were a bit confsing for me but I have an XBox One controller and once plugged-in those controls are perfectly natural."
"Excellent game, don't let all the anime fool you. This had a solid story and didn't have all the oversexualized, pedophilia that is commonly associated with games of this 'visual style'."
I could never say enough nice things about this game. LOVE IT
"It's a well made and produced Jrpg set in 'WW2'. Its a beautiful story if you like, anime/manga."
"This game is so amazing, it's story, character design and artwork is just so beautiful. it's able to capture you every step of the way through the story, while also having you lead attacks in the defense of your country from 'The Empire' or imps as we call them."
"Suprisingly good. Good controls, fun battle system, and good story. I had to resort to guide for one battle, but the rest are playable and have clear goals."
"I highly recommend this game. The story was very good. The battles gets progressively harder and sometimes you really have to think what to do in order to win. I don't normally like turn-based games, but this was just great."
"All I have to say is that this is a pretty good port, taking the idea of war games and throwing in some different ideas."
This is one of the best games ever made
"Great gameplay, great story, and great graphic arts.  "
"The game is great. Graphics and gameplay are really interesting and tactics indeed are important. Some minor problems like OP missions, but overall its really really good."
I was told it was a videogame.
"I like to start with the bad first:   I am not a big fan of anime, and a some of the tropes from that culture work their way into the game. Also, the game gives the impression that it may take the Fire Emblem route, and try to flush out the third-tier characters (as opposed to the main characters and the immediate supporting cast) but alas, aside from their brief sound bites and short bios you don't get much. The learning curve is a bit off, and the missions often tell you what you are supposed to do several turns in- after the point when you should already be executing the plan. Controls, particularly tank controls, are wonky on the PC port. There also seem to be characters which are far superior to others, cutting down on the mixing and matching you would normally do. The voice actors/animation for the two lead characters is sometimes cringeworthy.   The good:   A completely unique blend of tactical gameplay that kinda reminds me of Batallion Wars. At its core it is turn-based, but has enough real time elements to keep it interesting. It is also a game that really made me want to 100% it- getting A ranks on all the missions and having fun trying to figure out how to overcome each obstacle. The supporting cast to our two leads is impeccable, with interesting characters and great (albeat sometimes cheezy) acting. I got invested in the story, well, at least the first time through, and there are good moments which subvert the trope of treating warfare lightly in games.   The verdict: Not in my top tier of games, but for the combat system alone I say that this game is a must-play for any semi-serious strategy fan. 8/10"
"Played it when it first came out. Now I own all versions on the PS3, PC and now PS4. Must buy!"
"Awesome game. Really enjoyed the well written story, the fun and engaging gameplay, and the good voice acting.  The graphics are just right for what the game was trying to be.  The game balance is a little off, one class ends up dominating the game, making another class completely useless and the two others only special purpose. Still, the broken class didn't keep me from enjoying it.  I really hope they release the sequels, as I have heard they are more of the same great gameplay and story, but with better balance!"
Easily worth 5 euros.
"weird game, but so is everything."
this game is so great
one of the best strategy games i have played.
"A touching story,  I want sequel"
"I really love this! For JRPG fans there is question that this is one of the best EVER. For folks that are into SRPGS the gameplay here is really fun, and feels fresh. This definitely pushed the genre. Art style and story is very strong as well and it makes it hard to stop playing because I am constantly looking forward to the next chapter. The UI and menu system in these types of games are usually confused as way to miuch information is presented at one time, but not here as menu and ui features only become available when they are needed, and everything is explained well and I find nothing is ever overexplained. EVery gamer should havbe this in their steam collection! 9.5/10"
"Excellent mix of RPG, Strategy game and Third person shooter, I don't regret having bought this one at all! With a great story and huge replayability value, I cannot but hope for the ports of the other 2 games to PC!!! A must buy for every RPG lover, honestly."
Just a well made fun game with beautiful graphics.
"I don't know if I should warn people about or recommend that people play Valkyria Chronicles. I have a very split opinion about the game where I absolutely hate its insipid and shallow story so full of anime themes and tropes that I can't help but feel like I was being transformed into an otaku playing this game. But, the combat system is so robust, strategic and rewarding you really won't find anything superior to it in even modern games. The only real competitor it has is the XCOM series and even that series has a slightly easier and more traditional combat system than the one in Valkyria Chronicles in my opinion. All I can say is that being a fan of strategic turn based combat games I was able to weather through the ♥♥♥♥ storm that was the narrative in this game in order to really enjoy what was a fantastic and rewarding game that still out classes modern games in respect to gameplay mechanics despite having come out over seven years ago.  If you want to read my indepth review you can find it here:  http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2016/03/valkirya-chronicles.html ."
Final Fantasy meets Mass Efect in World War II
"great game with some replayability, love the art style, I recommend the anime series as well though some parts are different."
Really captivating game. Awesome game mechanics with plenty of content and memorable moments. Can't praise this game enough.
Hard as balls
"I absolutely love the game. Played it on the PS3 for hours and hours and finally picked up the PC copy.  Only issue I have is the god damn menus. No mouse control on any of the menus except using left-click to confirm. It's bogus and infuriating. My only real complaint.  Other than that, the art style is beautiful, the game runs buttery smooth, and I haven't had any crashes yet."
What a great game! 9/10   -innovative turn based battle system with some realtime mechanics (best of two worlds) -many characters to choose into the squad (each with his/hers own style) -interesting story (told via 'cutscenes' between battles) -beautiful visuals (almost anime like) -good pc port with 60+fps (mouse/keyboard works but best experience is with controller) -huge replayability potential (get everything on A rank) -fully translated into english (it has original japanese audio too!)  So what are you waiting for - buy the game now :D
"Just throwing my +1 into the mix.   As of this review I only have ~2h logged to it, but I too originally had the PS3 version, logged many hours there. Beyond that, I don't have anything new to say that others haven't already said more eloquently.     "
"I've decided to revisit this game after playing it years ago on the PS3. It's an excellent port, to say the least, and feels like it was made for PC. If you're hesitant about playing this because it's a port, don't sweat it. It controls great. Just don't use your mouse to turn your tank or your action points will go down faster than your date on prom night.  It's a cheesy anime game, so don't expect groundbreaking writing or a lot of depth to the characters. They are, however, all uniquely voice acted and each character has their own biography that unlocks more information the more you go on. You'll feel invested in your units, as you should, since letting them stay unconscious for 3 turns kills them. Permanently. For an anime game, the character designs are pretty tame and they almost feel like real, genuine people in a real, genuine war, which I find charming.  My biggest issue is how around mid-game you can cheese the missions with the 'order' mechanic and a certain scout unit that you have. It made all my other units essentially worthless save for a few gimmicky fights and gave me no reason to deploy more than 1 or 2 units at most during every mission. A difficulty setting for the main story would have given this game a lot more depth and replayability, but it's a minor issue. There's still plenty to do in the game and plenty of challenges, including the DLC and hard mode skirmishes. If you're looking for a challenge, play those. If you want to cheese a stage in 1 or 2 turns, give your scouts a lot of love.   I won't go on and on about the sound, graphics and everything else. They're great except for the occasional hiccup here and there with the sound.   All in all, 8/10. Very pleased with my purchase, sale or not."
its good
Just buy it. It's fantastic
its good if you're not allergic to anime
this game is hard but really fun it makes you think like you are playing chess in that you really think about how the A.I. plays and how you troops play. if you are looking for a hard game this is it.
"While the port has a few bugs, the over all game play is very nice. I rather enjoyed the style of turn based combat that VC brings to the table. And I wish that there were more games that used the BLiTZ (Battle of Live Tactical Zones) system, or style. Especially if they would include multi-player, and a bit more customization.  Many of the missions take a while to do, yes. And at times the story seems to drone on. But over all, it fleshes its self out. I would rate it in my top 10 RPGs, and top 5 Strategy games.   You have to think about movement, supression fire, placement, tactical advantages/disadvantages, and on top of that your team's quirks. Some of them suffering from severe allergies, which effect their stats, while others gaining major boosts during stressful situations. All in all I think it is a great game."
"Very nice game! You can do 4k downsampling and it willl look gorgeous. The story and gameplay is also very nice. Buy it.   Bear in mid that this is a slow paced game, where you can chill, absorb the story, and play. If you are looking for a fast paced game, then this is not for you."
"PS3 Classic on PC! Great turn based strategy, mixes squad based tactics with fast paced and decisive movements. Very similar to X-COM but with it's own unique art style and identity. Story is wonderfully told in a comic book format, with the graphics being colorfully cel-shaded complete with written sound effects ('Poom!') to match.  Squad management is not terribly deep or punishing, which makes this appealing to the more casual gamer while rewarding players who take the time to carefully build a synergetic squad.  Upgrades and equipment is very linear and lacking in creativity, although customisation options for vehicles adds depth and opens up different styles of attack.  The combat system is fresh and unique, and lands somewhere between Jagged Edge's real time system and X-COM's turn based system. Soldier and vehicle movement is very intuitive and encourages risk taking for higher percentage attacks and better field position.  A fantastic game experience now available on PC! Highly recommended for any strategy fan."
"Possibly the greatest SRPG of all time. The blend of turn-based combat with real time command of your troops makes the game feel action packed, while the battles are actually cerebral and slow paced, often resembling puzzles where you need to exploit the weaknesses of an apparently overwhelming enemy.   The levelling system is also superb, completely avoiding any kind of grinding or need to let weaker units get kills. You simply focus on the tactics and can then choose to distribute XP to entire classes in between missions.  The characters and plot are nothing special, but anime World War 2 is entertaining enough and the Japanese elements are subdued enough not to alienate western strategy fans, who will anyway be addicted to the combat system.  The game's AI is quite rudimentary, with enemies often doing stupid things, but this isn't really relevant, when it's the map design and enemy placement that defines the missions more. Besides, it's also quite satisfying to have slightly dimwitted enemy stormtroopers charging into your perfect crossfire and getting slaughtered.   The PC port is well executed, though a gamepad is the superior control experience. Strongly recommended."
THAT was a game. A truly amazing game. What initially seemed like a standard turn-based/real-time strategy hybrid quickly turned in to an amazing game with a captivating story and cast of characters.
"One of my favourite games of all times, ported extremely well onto PC (a lot of PC ports have issues, VC does not).  Can be played with either Keyboard + Mouse or the more natural feeling gamepad (it was a PS3 exclusive originally) equally well.  The art style is beautiful and has aged (and will continue to age) very well while the music score is the best I have heard.  Difficulty is just right, it may seem a bit harsh to start with, but enemies die just as quickly as you do (only boss type units are tougher than your own), and while you have a numerical disadvantage (up to 9 units) you have the benefits of being able to sling several (often game-breakingly good, but not essential to 100% the game at all (I've beaten every single non-DLC (well, it's pre-packaged DLC on the PC port) mission without them) orders as well as have better equipment.  VC is also a heavily story driven game, with cutscenes (skippable, at least on the second run, haven't tried on the first run) and gameplay segments sharing equal importance.  Like all good games, enemy AI does get derpy at times, doing things that would make their friends ashamed of them (like shooting their friends with friendly fire because they failed to realise that their friend was between them and their target)."
"I like the art, I like the game mechanics, I like the character prpgress, I got sick with the music. Anyway, good game for having enjoyable time. Worth the money most definitelly."
buy and be amazed
I NEED JAPANESE SUBTITLE! @_@
"Not only is this probably one of the finest ports ever made but it features a great game in a genre that even in PC can be lacking sometimes. The combination of tactical but character driven gameplay, the unique visuals, a hearty campaign, the included extras in the form of all DLC originally released for a fraction of the price and the unbelievable work that has been put into making sure that the game runs like a dream even on low end machines truly make this the definitive version of VC and nothing short of a Sega masterpiece.  It does have its flaws, particularly with the first couple hours of the game being fairly slow and a tone that will make some people raise eyebrows at first blush; but there is no doubt that this game can stand toe to toe with some of the classics of the genre and stand far above modern renditions of some beloved franchises like Jagged Alliance."
You already know that you want to play this game.
This is an absolutely fantastic game!
"Good port, great game."
Ohhh boy... what to say about this game i barely know and already love ?!?! Just take a look at when i got the game and my play time... you will see what i'm talking about !! Anyway.. the graphics are extremelly awesome :D  the gameplay is cool and you have to be a little precise to get to the end of the battle. Some thinking here and there is a necessity. If you like games that forces u to think on what to do next... BUY THIS!!!!!! If you don't like... BUY THIS and begin to :D
Probably the best World War II Anime strategic RPG right next to Shrek 2 on the gamecube
"I've played a lot of XCOM EU/EW, and this plays much in the same way, but with more emphasis on objective play, defensive action, and situational action. The main thing that differentiates the two, by my perception, is that anime folks are MUCH better shots."
"I really enjoyed this game. The artwork is nice and the game mechanic plays well. The story line can drag on at points, with many visual scenes to watch between the combat. It is possible to pseudo-cheat in these battles, as you can save at any point and so can repeat battles phases when it doesn't go your way. That being said this doesn't make the combat less enjoyable. There is also a lot of enjoyment watching your scouts blow up enemy tanks and bunkers. If you are a fan of Advanced Wars, I would recommend this game for you."
"So many PC ports have dissapointed me, planting seeds of doubt and despair as to whether I'll ever see a halfway decent PC port in my lifetime. Until Valkyria Chronicles came along and invaded that land, uprooting those seeds, salting the grounds so that they may never take root again. Except Valkyria Chronicles isn't about invasion, so the analogy doesn't hold, yeah. I know. I'm sorry. I tried.  This game is part Fire Emblem, part XCOM, and part pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dope. Characters are endearing, and the anime toon-shading here is absolutely gorgeous. This is one of those games that will age well, a la Windwaker, in both it's relatively simple, but elegant gameplay, as well as it's effortless charm. It didn't feel like a standard JRPG, so I'd even recommend it to friends who aren't quite into that genre. In fact, you know what? I'll end this review and do that now.  Don't pass up this gem. If you do, I'll... I'll... well, I'll be sorry for your loss, I guess. It'll make me feel pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥."
"There are minor balance issues between classes and progression, along with some issues of difficulty in later issues.  However, the game has a good story and game play, and overall is a good purchase to those who enjoy JRPGs."
Very good cutsences very good gameplay. Grapics are like in the old times which makes the game look even way better! Worth to get. Even more worth to get the 2nd one!
"Very fun game. Being a fan of turn based combat (FFTA, Tatics Ogre, Fire emblem) I simply loved its combat mode, Tank upgrading, weapons improving and training mechanic is simple yet still gives you a fair amount of depth."
"This game is amazing.  The graphics are superb, the musical score is breath-taking, the story line has a lot of suspense, and the combat sequences are intricate and unique for its genre.   If you are an RPG lover, try this game out!"
"Edy is the worst shocktrooper because of panicking issues, still a staple on every mission.  10/10 Desu wa"
"Really nice, and I heartily recommend it. The storyline is rather painfully anime at points, and some of the missions later on get a bit grindy, but overall this is definitely worth it."
"One of the best and most innovative games I've ever played. Super fun, though the battle system takes a little while to get into if you've never played a turn-based style strategy game. The characters are all fun and lively, and the overall challenge level is pretty solid. I played the hell out of this when it first came out on the PS3, and I'm super happy PC owners will finally get a chance to play it now.  Managed to put in (too many) hours yesterday, losing track of time as I found myself once more drawn in by the story and tactics of this game. Valkyria Chronicles is, perhaps, one of the best-written Japanese games I've ever played, in terms of the characters and the emotional arcs of the story. The artwork is gorgeous, the gameplay is fun and innovative... yeah, this game still holds up after 8 years."
Buy it so i can play second and third games hopefully
"Is a pretty good game, this is, homie, buddy, pal, friend, fella, klondike bar.  You're some weeb dude in apparently the only competent country in imaginary Europe. You almost get moidered by a baker, and then you get a tank and you kick every commie in the ♥♥♥♥. Is got a lot of flaws, like an awful difficulty curve and crud like that. But overall, you should play it unless you hate yourself."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a really great game, The whole anime thing aside -- this is a really fun and challenging turn-based strategy game. The story is nice and the characters are fun and entertaining. I really enjoyed playing this game and was sad to see that it's sequels are not available here on steam. The only 'bad' thing I have to say about this game is, sometimes in battles, there seems to be 'invisible walls or objects' -- like some things has bigger invisible surfaces that prevents you to shoot through or walk through -- like amp posts and edges of walls and so. That was kind of a bummer. But besides that, this game was really fun. I was afraid when I started playing that this game would be 'too anime' But it turned out to be a lot of fun. Concept is cool and there are tons of information about characters, places, items and such that you can unlock and read. I hereby recommend it :) It was a nice experience to play."
After many years I've found I game I enjoy as much as I enjoyed Advance Wars.  And it made me cry. Twice.  10/10
"There is few games I've played more than once, this is one of them. This game has a great storyline, beautiful artstyle, and no need of grinding skirmishes, among other good things.  In short, highly recommended  EDIT: only one thing that i almost forgot: the english subs sucks"
"Has good art, gameplay and music. Also has a lot of content (both main game and optional) to play through. If you can look past the fact that the characters are a bit 'anime cliche' then you'll find they grow on you.   Story-wise it's pretty generic, big bad Empire wants to rule the world but a rag-tag team is out to take them down against the odds, but it's still engaging and has some nice twists.  The only real downside I can think of is that the game can be a bit buggy sometimes, especially when controlling the tank with a mouse - it just seems to go crazy. I'd recommend to use a controller if you have one, but it's still perfectly playable if you don't.  Basically it's a scaled-down RTS with more focus on individual character abilities and putting them together to work as a team.  Or just max leveling your scouts and cheesing every stage with them  . Good fun if you like RTS and maybe RPGs - you can customise and level up your squad throughout the game, and there's always the ability to play in new ways.  It's not without its flaws, but overall it's a really nice and fun game."
"I highly recommend this game. It fuses turn-based strategy, FPS, and JRPG into one, and it's amazing."
"I remember playing this when it came out on PS3 but I was not the best as I rushed through everything and got stuck really quickly but when I got it on PC I started to take my time with everything and I managed to get futher than I have been before. I found that it was easier to aim with a mouse than the PS3 controller, but at first I found it really annoying to control the tanks but after a while I managed to get the hang of it. The story to this game really suits it and is broken up with cutscenes and the characters talking to each other so the story is really broken down so you are not sitting through cutscenes or them talking. The level system is nice and easy to use as you don't level up individual character you level up the classes and you can occasionally learn a new order to use in battles. The weapon and tank upgrade is also nice and easy to use and you get the credits and the exp after you do a battle, and as you get later into the game you get more but there are skirmishes to do to earn more credits that don't affect the story at all and you can grind them as well. If there is any game I would recommend buying it would be this game."
I originally had this game for PS3 and loved it. Once I switched to PC only I kinda forgot about it until the Sega sale happend. This game is absolutly amazing and is one of those games where you can sit down for hours upon hours and never get bored. It's amazing and you should totally get it!
"Good gameplay,character really dies so people will protect it, Easy to win and get an 'A' rank as long you use your brain 10/10"
I got some bread and then started shooting people. 10/10
"I think this game actually pisses me off more than X-COM does, and I didn't think that was even possible.  10/10 would rage quit again."
great game
"I absolutely adored this game! The graphics, characters, gameplay, and story were just wonderful!"
"This is a really good game! It made me cry, smile, rage, and think. Strategy game meets loving story!"
"Ran up to enemy, fired, shots clipped through his head, enemy then proceeds to mow down my squad.   Slight eaten hot dog/ used steam wallet card"
"An excellent tactics game! People are marking this as an RPG/JRPG but I really don't know why. The game isn't about building characters or even building a squad (given how you can swap people in/out between each battle) - it's about putting the right types of soldiers into the right positions and choosing the right targets for them.  The story is an extremely cliche JRPG story designed for kids but the battles are quite challenging. This leads to the game encouraging you to eat your vegitables then handing you your ♥♥♥ on a plate! Heaven only knows what audience they were targetting but it's easy enough to skip through the story to get to the good stuff.  The battle system is fairly unique. Imagine something like XCom but, instead of moving soldiers around from overhead, you actually zoom in to a first person view until the soldier's turn is done, then pop back out to the overhead view. The system works very well for keeping a perspective of the battlefield while still letting you see it as a real place instead of just markers on a board. I hope more games use a system like this!  The port of the game is OK. There are still some wonky controls (especially for the tanks) and you have to go through a 'title' screen just to quit the game but it has got a fine save game system. (You'll need it, too! Save at the start of every turn and I don't mean over the top of your previous save.) There are also some map bugs floating around in the game that will either stop your character for no reason or will drop them right through the floor.  All in all the game is well worth $20 if you like tactical level squad games. Just sing real loud and hit the skip key when the cute pig shows up and try not to think about what the Geneva Conventions are going to say about the age of some of your soldiers."
"Love the originality of tactical gameplay ... feels like FFT with alot more of features , this is a must !!!!"
"If you are interested at all in turn-based tactical games, get this game NOW. It doesn't matter if you like or dislike anime and anime storylines, you are only doing a disservice to yourself if you choose not to play just because of that.  Valkyria Chronicles is basically a turn-based squad FPS, and its biggest contribution to the turn-based genre is that it makes the battlefield continuous instead of split up into grids or hexes. Taking cover is a lot more natural and is not limited to specified grid squares. You can stack up an entire squad of 10 people behind your tank and effectively use it as cover. And you really have to take care when taking cover. If a tiny bit of your tank's rear end is sticking out of cover, or a tiny bit of your infantry's leg is exposed, you can get hit. Fortunately it works in reverse as well. You can actually shoot enemies through a tiny 6-inch gap between walls. These are just a few of the things you can do in this game that just isn't possible in grid or hex based games.   The story isn't so bad either, though as with most anime storylines it is a bit saccharine and full of anime cliches, particularly at the beginning. It could be a bit jarring for a war story. Stick with it until the middle though and it gets considerably more serious. Small spoiler: someone dies, and storywise they pull it off really well. I got hooked by the story around that point, and it really helped that I wanted to know what happens to these characters as I went into the endgame.  The RPG elements of the game are pretty well done too. You earn XP which you pour into your 5 soldier classes, increasing their stats and their abilities. Upon reaching level 11, your soldier classes become elite, which for 2 classes (the scout and the stormtrooper) completely change the way you use them in combat as they receive game-changing secondary weapons. The pace for progression is also pretty well tuned. I didn't feel that I had to grind through missions repeatedly just to level up my characters so they can succeed in the next story mission.  The visuals of this game are awesome. If you want an example of how to make a game look timeless, this game is a good one. It doesn't rely on the latest and greatest graphics tricks to look good. Instead it uses a hand-drawn watercolor-like storybook look throughout the game and pulls it off exceedingly well. Everytime I open up the personnel viewer I have to convince myself that the character models are indeed 3d models and not hand-drawn 2d. They look that good. I think the visuals of this game will hold up for a LONG time, the same way that 1930's Disney films like Sleeping Beauty still hold up today.  The game is split up into 18 chapters, each with at least 1 battle. It took me about 25-30 hours to go through all these, plus the little optional skirmish missions. The level and objective variety is pretty good. As you go through the game you will fight in a city, a forest, a wide open desert, a battle-scarred trench network and a fortress assault. You'll never feel that you have to do the same thing again as you go through the game the first time.  The biggest gripe I have on this game is that the AI can be very predictable, though fortunately you won't notice that as much on your first playthrough. Most enemies are either constantly on static overwatch, or follow specific paths through the map. You can also begin to reliably predict their behavior state changes and exploit them the more you play the game. It will take you the entire first playthrough to learn these though, so it isn't a dealbreaker. There are also small things like not being able to use low cover other than sandbags but there's usually some full cover near these places so it isn't as bad.  The porting work is decent, giving you full mouse support during the combat sections though you still have to use the menus in the old fashined way. It suffers from the usual too-many-menus syndrome of most console games but fortunately you only have to deal with that in between battles. The PC controls during the battle itself are completely intuitive and you can change and rebind keys to your preference in the game launcher.  This is a magnificent game and it was a crime to have it locked up as a console exclusive for all these years. The way it mixes squad-based FPS and turn based strategy is absolutely masterful and should be done in more games. The visuals look great and the PC port is well done. Add to that the fact that it is only 1/2 to 1/3 the price of full-price games and the only question left is: Why are you still reading this review instead of playing Valkyria Chronicles?"
hands down the best JRPG on PC
me and the squad went to the beach after liberating a concentration camp    war is hell
"Pretty cool game (kind of like xcom with more anime), and Sega's ports have been on point lately; if there are any problems, I've yet to encounter one.  My only gripe with the game is the design choice to allow a given character to act several times per turn. I feel this leads to balancing issues in what could otherwise be a fairly strategic game. Enjoyable nonetheless."
Told about this game by a friend and I knew I would like it.  It is a turn based strategy game more or less like X-Com enemy unknown. Story is pretty strong and the graphic is unique.     Note: this game make me heavily wound my own unit and save them afterward just to find their 'hidden potential'     11/10 gonna shot KO my unit again.
"To think that this game was released on the year 2008, this has more quality than most games today."

"Not all tactical fighting games grab me but this one did. Highly recommended if the idea of an anime-looking steampunk-ish war game with some customaization depth, character personaltiy perks and disadvantages in combat planning, RPG elements, and a great story look appealing then you won't be disappointed.  9.5/10."
I played it on PS3. Now I played it on Steam and probably will play PS4 remastered version. Now please Steam bring other Valkyria games!
Now if only the sequals were to be ported to pc......
"Best strategy game on the PS3, excellent port 1080p 60fps."
This is the best JRPG I've played on steam. Fans of Fire emblem will love this game! Now if only we can Valkria Chronicles 2 &amp; 3 on steam...
"I regret buying this game when it was on sale. Because it deserves the full price. Loved every minute of it. Gameplay was top notch, story was immersive, the whole game was amazing. If anything I'm just sad that the sequels aren't available on PC. It's a combination of turn-based stratergy and 3rd person shooter which in my opinion is very unique and refreshing. And have i mentioned the story? AMAZING STORY. Each character in squad 7 has their own voice actor and their own backstory which makes them seem more relatable and real and each character had unique abilities which followed thier perosnalities. Also, there's plenty of lore and other stuff to read which makes the world in the game muc more immersive. It also touches on the sensitive topic of racial discrimination which is a very realy problem in today's world. I can't put this game into words though. It was just that amazing. Look at the other reviews because they explain it in words better. Do consider buying the game. You won't regret it. Oh and I rate it an Alicia Melchiott/10"
"fun and easy to get into, but gets MUCH harder as you progress story, gameplay, well thought simple yet complex RPG mechanics both in prep and on the battle as an avid fan of advance wars, the simply typing system of whats effective and of fire emblem where each units has their own persona  this has to be one of sega's best hidden gems of this era, once you get through the slow start (heavily story based), the whole adventure is a blast  NOTE: not for the simple minded, it has a plot and gameplay that demands a level of thinking that may be consider above an etiquette level"
"amazing game, super fun, nice story.  tank controlls are the worst i have ever seen."
"If you're a fan of strategy JRPG's, get this game"
"The controls are clunky at times and the AI is not the best, but I enjoyed the hell out of it and headshots never get old :D"
"lost the bet, got stressed, sold the remaining dota skins, buy this on 75% off, try it, stress gone"
"One of the best games I have played. Although the anime isn't so....great, but the game is awesome. Good mind of tactics and role playing at the same time. Awesome animation and engine."
watch anime first and the play this game
it's aight
Totally worth it... every dime.
"A fantastic port of a Playstation 3 classic. Challenging, fair gameplay in a mature narrative. Characters can be kind of silly, but this IS anime, so it's kind of standard. The story is surprisingly rich considering the art style and combat system."
"One of the best stories I've seen in the last few years, plus a good turn-base tactical combat system. Sounds like 'Shut up, and take my money'. The one and only major disadvantage - joypad is required. But everything else is just great."
WHY YES I DO THINK THE LANCER CLASS IS QUITE PHALLIC WHY DO YOU ASK

This Game Is The ♥♥♥♥ Buy It Now!
"A great strategy game similar in many ways to Xcom, but set in a WWII type scenario instead. It also adds its own unique additions to the various mechanics. The class upgrading is done across the board, so when you upgrade a character class(Scout, Shocktrooper, etc.), all characters of the scout class get upgraded to the next level. Same with upgrading weapons and unlocking new ones, everyone that can use it can equip it immediately without having to pay for it. And the game is very story rich.  Whey it comes to the actual combat, it's turn based, where you have a bar that depletes as the character moves, and can shoot once per phase. You get a certain amount of 'Command Points' per turn, and you use that to make character act. So I can select Character A, in which I can now move and attack(or use an item). Then I can select another character and do the same until I finish using my Command Points. But I can also select Character A again if I wanted, but each consecutive 'selection' lowers how much movement points they get.  Valkyria Chronicles has full controller support, however the Keyboard/Mouse controls are also wonderful, which is practically unheard of with PC ports. It also has 60FPS support too.  If I had to desribe it in short, it would be like an Anime XCOM with far more depth and set in an alternate World War II. All in all, I definitely recommend this game, especially to Turn Based Strategy fans. Amazing game."
"Not into anime stuff. But this is good. That said, i bought it with a 75% discount voucher. Sadly only in English. And the controls are kinda weird, but overall its a good game-port."
"This is a very well-executed port of one of the PS3's earliest exclusive masterpieces, the most creative and innovative strategy game of last generation.  If you've played it previously on PS3, this is the same game, but with a few upgrades and additions: the inclusion of all DLC, a better framerate, achievements, and keyboard+mouse controls. It's worth noting that this same port is now on PS4, but I chose this version simply because aiming with a keyboard and mouse is a bit easier than with analog sticks. This version does support the XBox controller layout right out of the box, though, so you can use that if you do prefer analog sticks.  That's what's new in this version. If you've never played the game, read on:  This is a turn-based strategy game with some innovative twists to the mechanics.  Half of the gameplay is familiar: you deploy units onto a map, and then order them to move and attack, one-by-one, until you've exhausted moves for your turn; then, the enemy does the same. Repeat until your objectives are met or failed.  What makes the game unique is what happens while you're ordering each individual unit. The camera shifts from the overhead map to a third-person camera, and you control the character in a way similar to a third-person shooter. Your shots aren't fired in real-time, however; it still maintains the strategy custom of lining up your shot and pressing a button to execute your attack, at which point the attack process happens automatically, factoring in elements like cover and angle. You must be quick and focused while moving your characters, however, as enemy units positioned along the map can still fire at your character in real-time (and the opposite is true as well, so it's on you to position your units in ways such that they can take shots at advancing enemy units during the enemy's turn phase).  This blend of turn-based strategy with semi-realtime interaction makes for a unique and creative style of gameplay that's never been previously seen, making Valkyria Chronicles one of a kind."
"Good story, great art style, challenging strategy. Loved it from start to finish"
This game left me speechless.
"War, huh yeah What is it good for? Anime Waifus actually. Waifus, huh yeah? Alicia and Edy. Top tier; say it again y'all Waifus, huh. What are they good for? Fighting in wars, apparantly."
Like xcom with anime girls.
"got it on the sale *played for hours and hours, the mechanics are neat, really made me think  *tried to beat the Desert Barious Skirmish on Normal and foolishly saved during battle, got my ♥♥♥♥ kicked in repeatedly *played for 6 hours (with breaks) and finally inched Alicia to the enemy camp's flag and captured with all my units dead on the field *played more VC in conclusion if you want to enjoy this game don't be stupid and always save during BOOK mode, just in case you lose to 5 snipers shooting at you for 8 turns Still an 8.5/10     "
This is one of those games that reminds us that Video Games can be considered art. 
I recommend it
10/10 game i have lots of tactical fun with it and looks godly on pc.
XCom with waifus 10/10 would most def buy again
"stop putting greentext stories and 10/10 in your reviews, it's really cringy"
It's like an anime that you can play. 8/10
"♥♥♥♥'s really good, yo! You learn to get headshots with tank shells and backstab tanks for extra damage. It comes included with the playable Selvaria dlc, and the ♥♥♥♥♥quad dlc. Fun anime stuff like trips to the beach and food humor, mixed with WWII stuff like concentration camps. Fantastic game! Half my squad died!"
Pretty cool srpg. It has a unique art style and isn't a chore to play.  The story has some cliches. Don't go into this expecting a hardcore grindfest.  PC version includes dlc from the ps3 game.
"Full Video Review -  http://youtu.be/MGTB7qEDuFE   Console to PC ports haven't got the best track record ever. Often they can be lazy and not fit for purpose. Thankfully barring a few issues Valkyria is a relatively good port. Firstly there is not a frame-rate lock which is great, the game is not locked at 30fps and the game will happily run at any resolution your system will support. They also have put in rebind-able keys which you may think is standard but console ports are notorious for leaving this out for PC gamers. One issue I do have is that the pre rendered in engine game cut-scenes will only show at playstation 3 quality which is annoying considering it means that more than likely you'll be playing most of the game at a better quality than the cut-scenes. Lastly the game runs very well even on limited hardware, I was away from home while playing this on a friends desktop that was running 4gb ram and a GTX 630 even on this the game not only ran smooth but the game saved that quick that I had to check if it had actually saved.  Now I personally hadn't played the game when it originally released due to not having a playstation 3. So I was coming into this as a new player as many PC gamers will be. The game is told through a menu which is a book that has chapters. Each chapter has several episodes which can be played one by one. Some episodes are story cutscenes only, others will be missions and lastly there will be optional cutscene episodes that while aren't required to advance usually have great story relating to the characters.   Lets get down to the core of the game play which is the combat. The game is a turn based tactical RPG and works from command points. At the start of each turn you have a set number of CP to use. CP is used to move units and attack, use orders and request reinforcements. Depending on the action it may require one or more CP to be used for example moving and attacking using a scout will use one CP but doing that with a tank will require two. The amount of CP you have each turn depends on the units you have selected to do battle with. Some units are leader units which will add a CP each turn if you deploy them however should they die that CP will be removed. You can also take out leader units in the enemies team to achieve the same effect on their side.  Once you've selected a unit you move from the command view map to third person and you can free move the character but have a limited movement bar which will deplete as you move. You can attack by pressing to enter target mode at any time and you can change your equipment too. One thing that has irritated me about movement in the game was the games cover system. You can crouch at sandbags which gives you cover and thus a defensive and evade bonus, you can also go prone in tall grass however you cannot crouch and enter cover in other objects around the battlefields like wall rubble and such which doesn't really make sense.  Each character has different stats such as health etc. That coupled with the weapon stats will effect things like aiming, evade chance, damage and more. Each class has strengths and weaknesses that need to be taken into account. An example is the scout class, they have more movement than other units, they are long range however they cannot take many hits and are weak against heavily armored foes. Alternatively the Lancer is a great anti armor unit, perfect for taking out tanks and such however they are very vunreable to gun fire.  Characters also have special abilities called potentials which are essentially stat modifiers that are triggered by various psychological or environmental factors in battle. An example of this is one shock-trooper named Rosie. Should you have her lead the way while surrounded by your squad you'll active her big sister potential which grants buffs. Potentials are not all good however such as some troops having a pollen allergy and should you run them through bushes or grassland it might trigger making them less effective in combat.  The environment plays a big factor in battle. Not only does play a part in activating certain potentials but using the environment to your advantage is key to finding the best strategy to win. Take a enemy gun bunker, now head on you could use lancers or a tank to destroy it but that would take several shots and use an awful lot of CP. However you could use less CP to take a scout and skillfully move through the environment to flank the bunker and shoot the ragnite canister behind it to blow it up in one. Using the environment is not only useful for taking out the enemy but its essential for keeping your troops alive, leaving them exposed invites enemy snipers to make short work of your squad.  Should one of your squad go down they enter critical condition and need to be medevac'd. This can happen by moving one of your squad to their location and they will call for a medic or using a specific order. Should you not get to them in time or an enemy touches their body, they will die and be gone forever. However you can summon reinforcements in the midst of battle by using your base.  On many battlefields there are several bases denoted by flags. Once you occupy an enemy base and fly your flag you'll be able to use it to summon new troops and to retreat ones currently in battle. Bases also give stat bonuses for any squad members standing in them as well as bonus health regen at the start of the turn for those in range/  Graphically the game is a treat not only does the art direction and hand drawn art look beautiful but it gives the game a timeless quality so that even now and years to come the game will look fantastic. While there aren't many options it play with the graphics the game works runs well on low end machines. The games soundtrack composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto it is a fantastic score that adds wonderful drama and tension throughout the game.  The games story is wonderfully told, its packed with great characters and writing. While if your not a fan of JRPG style stories and characters it's charm might be lost on you. I have always enjoyed JRPG's and Valkyria Chronicles ticks all the right boxes for me, its got action, drama, betrayal, love as well as some more meaningful themes that are not too dissimilar from real life world wars.  Overall Valkyria stands the test of time and is a must for any RPG fan. It's certainly a rarity that a console port is good even more rare is that a SEGA port is good. The blend of episodic storytelling with tactical turn based combat works really well and the game hooks you into the characters so you really care about not letting them die in battle. I would certainly recommend the game to anyone especially people who have never played the game before."
"Amazing story if you haven't saw the anime yet you should. The first playthrough the difficult is fine. If you like strategic-turn based-rpg this one is for you. It has a lot of cutscenes and dialogues. You need to place and move your units to good spots, heal them if needed and refill the ammo. It's a good strategic game, you can have a few team's and choose who will be on the battle, but since it's a novel it will lock some characters on some battles.  "
"This is my favorite anime, right alongside Asura's Wrath and Borderlands."
"Great game. It's definitely beautiful, and has a good to great story. Some game design choices are questionable, but it's a really nice turn based strategy game with a first person perspective. The highest downside is that it's by SEGA, and giving SEGA money isn't too great considering their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ attitude towards youtubers. But if you're getting a game from them, get this one."
"Definitely a game worth checking out. Why? Read on.  The aesthetics of the game are borderline peerless, with every tank, character &amp; class looking visually distinct from one another in what must be one of the most consistent pieces of art in the gaming space. It perfectly fits the motif of the games pretty unique setting, which is loosely based on the events of World War II, with its own fictional supernatural sprinkle on top. It's an interesting mix that thankfully treats the events of the War with the utmost respect, while also inviting us into it's wonderful &amp; scary world in a relaxed manner.  The characters are mostly great, with Welkin &amp; Alicia's relationship surely going down as one of the greatest &amp; most believable in the history of video games. A few of the villains are a tad predictable, and a lot of the minor characters are done to extremes (Jann &amp; Leon being good examples of this), but they're for the most part ignorable, and do not detract too much from the overall enjoyment of the game. Sadly, the voice acting is nothing special, but the audio design as a whole really is top notch, and ties in perfectly with the games beautiful, unique style.  Regarding the gameplay, combat is a bit hit and miss. It's overly simple &amp; easily exploited, with a ranking system that makes little sense but still remains important, and minor issues like the odd invisible wall that bullets cannot penetrate, and tiny lips and dips that can foil the movement of a ten tonne battle tank. There are a couple of high quality combat mods that are supposed to be worth checking out, and while I can't comment on those personally, I'd definitely recommend checking them out if you have the time.  Overall, as a lovingly crafted tactical JRPG, Valkyria Chronicles has a lot going for it, but there's also quite a lot to overcome if you're wanting to see it through to the very end. Very much worth your time, though!  "
"This game is sort of an alternate-universe retelling of World War II. This isn't your typical war drama, though. No, this is War Lite™, where war has been sanitized for consumption by a PG-13 audience. Heavy topics such as racism and mass murder are present, but only lightly touched upon, serving as side points to the main story which focuses on the relationships of your team, Squad 7.  This is not an inherently bad thing, but I can understand why some people may not appreciate the watered-down vision of war that the game presents. Personally, I didn't mind this too much; light and flufffy games can still be fun if they're done right, and this one is certainly no exception. If you can get over the game's anime-ness and occasional saccharine dialogue, you'll find that this game has an interesting story and likeable characters, even if they sometimes fall a little flat.  The gameplay is where Valkyria Chronicles really shines, though. It is a mash-up of turn-based strategy and 3rd-person action, and it works extremely well. You view the battlefield as an overhead tactical map first, and then you drop down into 3rd person mode when you decide to command a unit. Units have a limited range of movement and you can only perform one action per turn - so you are encouraged to consider every action carefully. Staying in cover and using the terrain to your advantage is key to keeping your units alive. If you don't, you will often find your units ruthlessly killed by snipers or ambushes when the enemy's turn comes around.  However, if you've placed your units right, you will find that they will dish out intercepting fire against the enemies and kill them off before they get a chance. This can be  extremely  satisfying. You are rewarded for smart play, and that's exactly what you want in a strategy game.  The other great aspect of this game is the attention to detail that has been given to the squad members themselves. Every soldier in the roster (and there's dozens of them) has their own distinct personality, strengths, weaknesses, and even unique voice overs (which probably explains why this game weighs in at 20 GB on the hard drive!). Some soldiers also synergize better with others, and finding the right combinations to deploy into battle is half the joy of Valkyria Chronicles.  The gameplay is not perfect, however. Tactics can be somewhat limited in the story quests, which too often rely on scripted sequences and highly linear level design (however, if you simply want to focus on the battles without that stuff getting in the way, there are repeatable 'skirmish' battles available that allow you to do just that, and they still allow you to earn money and XP for your troops).  Also, this game also relies a little too heavily on gimmicky boss battles. You know the ones. You're fighting a boss, but not  really , because instead of actually fighting them, you have to complete a bunch of tedious side objectives to 'weaken' them or make them run away, such as destroying generators or covering them in rubble, things that have nothing to do with actually fighting them. This game does this because most of the bosses are key characters in the story that need to fulfill their roles later, but it can be a bit tiresome nonetheless. Thankfully the skirmishes have none of this.  The enemy AI also feels a little lackluster at times. Enemies who are pre-placed in cover positions are your biggest challenges, but once they're flushed out, they seem to lose their minds and run directly at your forces. Same goes for reinforcements that are spawned from enemy camps. Essentially, this game relies too heavily on thwarting the player through clever level design rather than smart behaviour from the enemies.  Another thing to note is that this game was originally designed to be played on PS3 and, like many ports, it has some problems. The most noticeable issue is with the tank controls, which are a little wonky, and the mouse movement on the tactical map can also be a bit buggy when your units are bunched together. Aside from those small issues, though, this game has been ported extremely well in all other respects.  With all that said, Valkyria Chronicles is an extremely enjoyable game, and an excellent value for your money. You'll pay about $20 USD for about thirty hours of content, and that doesn't include the side plots and DLC's (all of which are now included in the full purchase price). With those included, you're looking nearly  forty  hours of content - Or even more if you're an achievement hunter.  I highly recommend this game. It's a must-play for any strategy game fan!"
"I typically hate strategy games. I look at the screen and I immediately think,   When am I gonna have time for all this (hearts)?    This game is draws me in though. I'm excited to manage my unit of crack fighters and varied specialists to thwart the evil machinations of a megalomaniac. Gallia is my home and no one's gonna roll over us!  The characters are fantastically fleshed out. The progression is perfectly paced. The experience, while linear, is so well written and executed that I don't even mind coming back to my military organization throughout the week to manage our frontline excursions. The only negative thing I have heard is 'yeah but it's made by sega and those guys are mean.' So (hearts)ing what? I don't run a gaming co and those decisions are theirs to make. The only negative thing I have to say is, there should be more games using this CANVAS engine. It's sterling (hearts)ing beautiful. Get this game."
"Incredible game. Mixture of turn-based strategy and third-person action.  I'm not big on spoilers, so all I will say is 'buy it'. It is an excellent game."
A simple if not stunning strategy game that pulls you through a WW2-esque story. Valkyria Chronicles delivers a rich storytelling enviroment with solid gameplay that will keep you playing for hours.  Pros -Multiple ways to complete each mission -Tech trees that allow different playing styles to succeed -A whole list of characters that you'll soon grow attached to (CAUTION PERMADEATH IS POSSIBLE)  Cons -Movement mechanic has a sharp learning curve that will leave you in some hairy situations until you get used to the distances characters travel
"Background: Played it on the Playstation back in the day and I am delighted to see DLC added.  Combat Mechanics: Open Map, Strategic Turn based - Look its hard to describe this one. So you have a number of Action Points per round and each point can control an Infantry unit or 2 points for the Main Tank. There are various classes with set equipment and max movement allotment. Shooting wise, you line up the shots and then the computer takes over dealing with range, accuracy, etc. Line of Sight plays a big part in this game and should be thought about when forming a strategy.  Military Downtime: Between your combat sequences there is a Huge amount of Lore behind this game and each character. Snippets of Conversation, movies, pictures all paint a rich detailed world with people who have families, wants and needs. It gives the game a more real feel and makes you care about the characters you control.  Final Thoughts: I love a good story. Even though this one is 100% linear and very grindy at times it showcases what developers focused on back in the day. Great Art, good story, and thoughtful mechanics."
"There are plenty of things that make this a good game: from the fun gameplay, to the interesting story , to the large cast of characters.   But there have been plenty of other reviewers who've already gone into much more depth then I have; So insted, let's talk about why I'm voting this as the 'Best use of farm animal in a video game award'  And it's all because of this loveable flying pig here, HANS   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=540628500    Now you may be asking, 'What makes this little guy so special?' well besides just being a cute flying pig, he's actually helped out his squad in plenty of other ways.   While not a direct help on the battlefeild he proved his worth on the first day of the job. Hans finds 2 flank routes behind a enemy base in the woods, and with a 3 pronged assult on the base the enemy retreated, saving lives on both sides of the conflic.   But he's not just usefull in the feild, he's also a great companion back at home base. Despite what you might think, he's actually pretty good help in the kitchen as he's helped the squad baker on several occasions. He's helped the boys blow off steam as he's wrestled with the strongest men in the camp. And he's he has a nak for burrowing his into the hearts of even the coldest people in the regiment like the sniper Marina, who never opens up to any of the people in the regiment but can occasionaly be seen hugging hans when she thinks no one is looking.   I hope that I at least made some of you give this catagory a little thought, be it to remind people who played this game about this loveable little flying pig, or to those who haven't to see there are a few good options out there for this catagory... (even though something like goat simulator will probably win, but dang it, I'm going to try anyway)"
"Anime-styled story in a 'not-WWII' setting. Characters are charming, although they fall into common anime tropes fairly often. The overall story is engaging and has a few strong set-piece moments, while also leaving time for quiet reflective moments.  Combat is very well-designed, and the player units become a force to be reckoned with later into the game, when strong weapons, skills, and equipment have been obtained. The combat system is turn-based, but moving units and attacking occurs in real-time, and the player has full control over which units they will spend their turn controlling. Unit classes are fairly imbalanced, with scouts becoming horrendously overpowered by the end-game. This means that many missions can be cleared while only using a single unit. This diminishes some of the squad tactics and positioning required, which is unfortunate.  Missions do a good job of staying fresh, with different objective types and environmental challenges on a regular basis keeping the player on their toes. The difficulty curve falls off a bit after the mid-game, when the player can obtain some of the late-game weapons and skills for their units. There are a couple difficulty spikes, but nothing too unreasonable.  The art style of the game is gorgeous, and the characters and environments have a gentle color palette and a sketched appearance. It looks good in stills, and even better in motion. The soundtrack fits the game very well, providing both whimsical and serious tracks that fit right in with the alt-history setting."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a little gem I never expected would hold my attention so firmly. The game is effectively a small unit tactical strategy in the same vein as UFO: Enemy Unknown and similar games. Your units use points to get around and have one significant action per activation. People who know this style of game will undestand this mechanic. However unlike other versions of this mechanic you may activate untils based on Command Points which allows you to activate the same unit several times if needed though each time they have a reduced Action Point pool.  The game was ledgendary on Sega and the port is a little clunky but still quite usable. The biggest frustration is driving the tanks.   The graphics is intended to look like a comic book. A series of animated sequences in panels. The game play has the same look but using 3D models with rag doll physics. So it keeps the feel of a comic book but has more modern engine.  The real attraction to this game is the story. Once you get to know the characters you will put hours into the game to follow the story to its conclusion. In addition, every character and soldier in the game has a back story you unlock during game play. A single run through the game wont unlock them all so finding about about everyone takes some effort.  Overall I think I'll be playing this game through at least two more times. I will probably come back to it over and over for years to come. Highly recommended and worth it."
"Easily one of my favorite games of all time; I wracked up 150+ hours on the PS3 version, and mainly bought this version just to support franchise, and holy crap is this game amazing.  Story-wise, Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best stories on the market, at least in my opinion. It tells the tale of Welkin Gunther, the son of a famous EW1 (Europan War 1) hero and his rise to fame as the commander of Squad 7. I personally really enjoyed all the characters and lore, and while the story becomes slightly fatigued by the end, it still remains very strong overall, consistently giving great characters and fantastic story development.  One of my favorite aspects of the game is how it handles this universe's equivalent to the Holocaust. The Darcsen - VC's stand-in for Jews - are shown to be consistently persecuted and even put in concentration camps, just like the real deal. The fact that the game showed how horrible these events were and done so with respect to the victim showed how big Sega Overwork's nuts were, as even today, discussing the Holocaust in a WW2 setting is something we rarely go forth and do. I won't spoil too much, but the way game tackles sensitive subjects in a realistic yet non-offensive way is something we really need in today's industry. Long story short, this game's story is fantastic, and is something that I wish is more reliably emulated today.  As for the gameplay, think of it as a fusion between Fire Emblem and XCOM; the Fire Emblem element is present with SRPG themes and permadeath, while XCOM has real-time combat elements like cover systems, overwatch firing, and tactical squad gameplay. It overall works brilliantly in this game's favor, as every battle feels unique, and even grinding to become stronger is a hoot, especially with all the unique variety of battles you fight throughout the story. The only complaint I have is how awkward the controls are for tanks, but hey, I ain't complaining.  Overall, Valkyria Chronicles is easily one of the best games I've ever played. Great story, great gameplay, beautiful graphics and music, fantastic port, AAA production values and indie-level quality. We need more games like this in the industry.  Go get it. Now."
"This is one of those greats that unfortunately never got the marketing to get the mainstream appeal it deserved when it was released on PS3. Even then it was a beautiful looking game where the Cel Shaded artstyle often makes it look the scenery look like a painting. The story is very well thought out, and makes use of some interesting parallels to real world events despite the world being a more fantastical one than our own.  Even with its large cast of soldiers to acquire and pick from within your platoon, they still put in the effort to make each of them stand out and have their own quirks and reasons for getting involved, even if a lot of them don't get as much focus as some of the key ones. The included DLC helps bolster this as well, adding in a short campaign revolving around one of the main Antagonists involvement in the war and a few others focusing on a specific subgroup of your Militia and their misadventures.  As for the gameplay itself, its an interesting mix of a classic turnbased tactical rpg and a third person shooter, Its got a bit of a learning curve and ends up being a bit remenicent of the old XCOM games but once you figure out how to properly command and move your troops into position it actually keeps things exciting and feels quite satisfying as you find better and better ways to clear maps with higher score rankings.  Well, and theres not much more thrilling than running a Shocktrooper through enemy lines in order to rescue a fallen comrade before they end up dying. Its a game where your troops live or die due to how good of a commander you are, and while its not really a brutal game difficulty wise, especially if you take advantage of all the different RPG elements for upgrading your troops, the risk of potentially losing characters you've grown fond of adds a lot more impact to the game. Well, if you don't just savescum your way to flawless victories, I mean you still have to make the shots but at least that way you don't have to worry as much about someone actually dying.  Also, as far as tanks go, the Edelweiss is a pretty cute one. Theres also girls with rifles and/or giant lance shaped bazookas, if those are your fetish.  The PS4 Remastered Version that just released has slightly better graphics than the Steam release, but if you don't have access to a PS4, or just like delicious Steam Sale pricing more than slight texture and shading upgraded, its definitely worth getting the HD Steam port instead.  Or well, you could also just be like me and either double or triple dip on buying it over and over again, cause really the game is worth buying twice at least. I would have bought it three times if not for just playing my brothers copy back on PS3. Its definitely a game worth coming back to though, which is why its my nomination for the Time After Time Steam Award."
"I wish I had some record of how many hours I played this game on PS3 before buying the PC port. This game is an amazing mix of strategy/3rd person shooter, and nothing else plays quite like it. The gameplay consists of a mix of viewing the battlefield from an overhead map and controlling individual units from a 3rd person perspective.   All the units you use (besides the namelss tutorial allies) are characters with complete backstories that becomes available through in game biographies as you use them more. Each unit also has unique traits that affect how they fight, albiet usually in a minor fashion (with a few somewhat overpowered exceptions).  The story itself doens't break too much new ground, however the pacing is good and the characters are likeable. It takes place in a fantasy setting loosley inspired by WW2, revolving around a small neutral country with many natural resources surrounded by larger powers. It specifically focuses on a civillian milita defending against an onslaught from the nearer of the two powers.  Overall good gameplay, good story, and an alright NG+ 9.5/10"
"This game pretty much nails controlling multiple characters in third person. You are asked to accept that gameplay mechanics require some suspension of disbelief (enemies don't shoot while you're aiming, weapons become ridiculously oversized as they are upgraded), but how is that different from any other video game?   Gameplay is well balanced so that the first playthrough is sufficiently challenging, while the second playthrough is a speedrun for acheivements.  Character development is really nice, with all ~55 squad members having cute/amusing/intersting backstories, personalities, and relationships with other characters - all of which is discovered through utilising each soldier.  Story is fairly good, features the expansive worldbuilding and attention to detail in the writing that you generally expect from big JRPG titles.  Did I mention that VC1 is really pretty? Because it is. This cell style looks good no matter how old it is. The visual style is sorely missed in later Valkyria games.  TL;DR Fantastic game would 10/10 recommend."
"Valkyria chronicales is an odd game to say the least. And yes it is a game about the 'Europiean' front of 'WWII' made by Japanese. Well that is kinda a lye since they made their own world for this to take place in, and there is enough world building to get away with it I do have to ask why? Maybe the dev team thought it might be to hypicraticle to make it about the acutal nazi's. The game it's self has it's ups and downs: for instance the game looks beautiful with it's picture book style asthetic, allot of the story is really well done with one moment that I thought was going to be a genaric 'Oh the enemy is just as human as us' but then a moment afterword it really knew how to twist the knife to make me really feel that moment and the game play is unique amongst turn based combat for better or wrose. The bad parts are that among it's other wise well crafted story is a character who with just a few tweeks to dialog could have been a very interesting character but I suppose the goal of the character was to show the downside to military leadership. In one scene he disrgards another another characters opinion for no reason when with just a few different lines it could have shown him as a man just trying to do his job the best he can given the circumstances. As far as the game play's fualts... Well it's biggest fualt is level design, one time spawning my tank (which I need to survive to complet the mission) in front of an anti tank cannon, or other levels which are poorly designed in other ways. I still recommend Valkyria chronicales, it does make a very interesting story that couldn't really be expressed in the real historcal world without extream changes to history. The game play is interesting, if a tad on the easy side, with allot of different sinarios to expand the game play."
"Graphics hold up amazingly regardless of age just because the water-color aesthetic is so good that the design really makes tech limitations effectively vanish. I'd even say the art and style make it even nicer to look at than many newer games.  Story is phenomenal. Kind of implemented in a way that it's mandatory, but it's engaging enough and such a major part of it that there's no reason to skip it unless someone's just apathetic towards it, in which case it's understandably not for them. Anime tropes might be offputing for some but they're not overwhelming. Lots of excellently done character development, in and out of battle, even for troops who don't really play a role in the main plot. Found myself picking 'worse' troops for my squad just because certain personalities and designs were so charming.  Loosely based on WWII, but makes the soliders feel a lot more human, and tackles the heavy subjects involved like racism much more effectively, and with a lot more power and openness, than I'd expect from a stereotypical WWII shooter.   Solid difficulty curve and fun, strategy-heavy combat throughout. Can easily sink a good number of hours into it. Ranking system incentivizes speed a little too much, but it's easy to ignore and I'd recommend doing exactly that just to get the most out of a first playthrough.   For anyone concerned about whether they'd like Tactical RPGS I'd recommend the free XCOM demo for a loose idea of what they're like, but VC is hardly expensive, especially on sale."
"Hey you!?!? Yes you there, reading this review.  Do you like turn based strategy games? Yes? good because this game has that  Do you like third person shooters? YES AGAIN?!?! well this game has that too....'but random dude on the internet, how can this game be both a TBSG AND a 3PS?' well let me tell you dear Billy, can I call you  Billy?....no?  that's not your name? tooooo bad Billy because it is now. This game has a unique mix of turn based strategy and third person shooting because you control a rag tag Militia group ,fighting the evil Imperials in a pseudo WW1 setting. When you take control of a unit in the strategy mode, you'll go to a third person view of that unit, and the game goes full on real time on your ♥♥♥ just to ♥♥♥♥ with you, making enemies shoot at your poor little militia dude (most likely a Teen or an tiny little kid) as he/she follows your dumb ♥♥♥ orders Billy.  Do you want a game filled with great charecters? (even if some of them are total weeb animu 1 dimensional characters) Yes? fantastic because this game has a huge selection of characters to choice from, and all with thier own little back-story, personallities and futures (that's assuming they survive your orders and dumb ♥♥♥ ideas BIlly)  Do you want to give yourself a challenge and min/max the living f out of a game? Yes? GOOOOODDD because trying to win mission and senarioes on an A-rank, with the minimum amount of turns and units used is a gives you a truly great feeling of achievement, which we all know Billy that you crave like a crack ♥♥♥♥♥ craves money (unfortunately there is no S-rank for this version becasue this is the Weeb version and not the proper Asian version, because in nibon land A's just aren't good enough, that's why they aren't dumb dumbs like you Billy)  Do you want a game with a unique style to it? Good, because this game looks like a drawn anime book, and let's face it Billy......you're pobably a total weebs and you're gonna buy it for that  Now doesn't that make you wanna buy this game  Billy?.....no?..........did  you just say NNNNNNOOOOOOOOOO?!?! PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE THE REASON WE DON'T HAVE THE SEQUALS IN THE WEST BILLY, GO DIE IN A FOREST FIRE WHILE BEING GANG ♥♥♥♥♥ BILLY   TL:DR: BUYS THIS GAME SO WE CAN GET THE OTHER VALKYRIA CHONICLES GAME FROM THE STUPID ♥♥♥ ASIANS!!!"
"Amazing turn-based stategy game with very likable anime characters (even some villains) and wonderful art.  Story is also great, although i personally liked the anime version better. It is mostly serious, with some fun parts, but still gets to show you the hardships of military life during the war.  Even though the game gets kinda repetitive as you do more and more missions (atleast for me), it's still very satisfying to finish them and move forward towards the story finale. And when you do get to the end, it will be worth it!  Gameplay is somewhat difficult - you get thrown into a battlefield with units of your choice. Problem is you have no idea what you stand against, and this game in particular likes to surprise you all time in this regard (and often not in a positive way). On the other hand, replaying missions, when you know what to expect, is like playing with massive advantage you even feel bad for getting away with it.  All in all, I think they did the right decision, game is challenging this way without getting stuck when you repeat the mission. Just don't get mad when you think you owned the mission and then all hell break loose and you get wiped. ;)  10/10 if you like these kinds of games (turn-based strategy), but people with aversion to anime, go back to XCOM.   One tip: find a way to remove that foggy borderscreen, it hinders your vision real bad (google it) Also, go play St. Quentin Scar map from BF1, it feels like fighting in Bruhl!"
"This is by far one of my favorite games of all time. The reason for this is simple, story and how unique every character feels. But a simple break down of the game's pros and cons goes like this.  Pros: -Art: Very detailed and made to look like drawings from an extremely detailed book -Story: Tackles racism and the cost of war in a unique story Characters: The main cast are a good, but comedicly eccentric group. In addition the squad members are all unique with the on characteristics and backgrounds that effect gameplay. -Combat System: The combat system is highly unique and can provide challenging gameplay.  -Levels: The difficulty level scales are a very good pace and no mission feels reptative unless of course you are playing the same mission more than once.  Cons -My one main con or maybe warning is the combat system. Since its is unique it can take some time to get used to it. Don't expect this game to play like a shooter at all. It is a strategy game that has taken a few aspects of shooters to develop its own system."
"A JRPG with a very unique XCOM-lite sort of combat system. I'm very ambivalent regarding it, maybe 5.5/10.  The setting is excellent and feels quite original - a lot of effort went into world-building and it shows. The story is pretty good, with the exception of being completely riddled with all sorts of cliches. The dialogue, anyone with the most basic knowledge of Japanese can tell that the translators took HUGE liberties with the dialogue, and not really in a good way.   As for the gameplay, it initially looks like it allows for some extreme strategic depth and I was originally optimistic. However, you eventually figure out the game and all of its nuances, and those nuances suddenly bring the strategic pool a lot shallower, once you understand the mechanics.  The level design starts out really strong and maintains that strength all the way until about 2/3 into the game. After that point, I feel that mission quality falls flat on its face and I'm ready for the game to be over.   I have no complaints nor major points to comment about the porting to PC.  The artwork is easily 10/10. Superb.  In summary, I think Valkyria Chronicles is a very flawed gem, whose major saving grace is that none of its flaws are deal-breakers, and it still is quite novel and that is to be respected."
"I've played the game to completion several times on the ps3 which is why my hour count is not high, i wish there was a way to import saves from ps3 to pc!    Pros    -The best game of the last generation -Very solid pc port -Low price -Graphics that did not age at all -One of the most original turn based strategy game system i've ever seen -Flawless execution -Lots of different characters with different traits and personnalities -Appealing characters -Lots of content (30-45 hours to finish the game) -Very good replayability -Well made tutorials -Japanese voiceover -Amazing soundtrack -Very good story    Cons    -New game+ is somewhat too easy -Apparently there's a difficulty spike during chapter 7... however i had no problem   I especially recommend this game for fans of turn based strategy games such as Xcom and Ring of Red but to be honest i think everyone can enjoy this game, i consider it a nice entry point into the genre.  Also if you want to replay the game, i would recommend starting a new game and not doing the new game+ because the game become way too easy."
"An uneven game.  But to sum it up short:  Pros: -Very good combat system -Entertaining story -Lots of stuff to do and unlock -Difficulty. While easy enough to beat (with slight exceptions), hard to get the top mark (affects the rewards)  Cons: -While the story is good, the conversations often feel awkward and feel more like interactive novella (as in: no choices) -Simplified graphics, but it looks good enough thanks to the filter that makes it all look more like 'paper' (see screenshots) -Skirmishes feel repetetive (but are optional) -Clearly a console port - interface and controlls both. Feels like playing PCSX2 emulator on keyboard, but the controlls are so simple that it does not impact the game much at all. In fact, more annoying in menus than gameplay.  Overall I'd give this game 8.5/10, with the clunkiness, old-looking graphics and controlls beeing the things that put it mostly down to that score. But seeing as the game is old (re-release), that's still damn impressive game!  Very addictive, a huge surprise for me. I didn't expect to sit to 4 am on this title for sure."
Should you buy it?  Ya
"I'm told it's amazing. Alas, the farthest I got was a black screen."
"Valkyria Chronicles was ported to PC after it's success on the playstation.  The port itself works really good, by far better than others I've seen.  The game is set in an similar situtation to the second world war on a fantasy continent. It's game mechanics are unique; it's a mix between RPG, turn-based strategy and third person shooter. This system is called 'BLiTZ'. It ensures you to have both action and strategy. Paired with an rpg-like upgrade system for all your equipment and your squad members and a thrilling plot line, this makes the perfect combination. (Of course, the plot line only stays thrilling as long as you have some progress and aren't stuck at the same mission) The grafics engine of the game is unique too (surprise surprise): the 'CANVAS'-engine. As you might guess by the name, it renders the world like it were painted on a canvas (obivously, duh). A little similar to BL, but the screenshots should cover this point. So much for the technical part. I may expand this review in the future. I'm really hoping for a successor here, both on PC and PS4. In case your're interested, the Remastered Edition for PS4 was released this spring, featuring 1080p 60fps engine, several bugfixes (tho I saw really little), and all DLCs."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a little gem I never expected would hold my attention so firmly. The game is effectively a small unit tactical strategy in the same vein as UFO: Enemy Unknown and similar games. Your units use points to get around and have one significant action per activation. People who know this style of game will undestand this mechanic. However unlike other versions of this mechanic you may activate untils based on Command Points which allows you to activate the same unit several times if needed though each time they have a reduced Action Point pool.  The game was ledgendary on Sega and the port is a little clunky but still quite usable. The biggest frustration is driving the tanks.   The graphics is intended to look like a comic book. A series of animated sequences in panels. The game play has the same look but using 3D models with rag doll physics. So it keeps the feel of a comic book but has more modern engine.  The real attraction to this game is the story. Once you get to know the characters you will put hours into the game to follow the story to its conclusion. In addition, every character and soldier in the game has a back story you unlock during game play. A single run through the game wont unlock them all so finding about about everyone takes some effort.  Overall I think I'll be playing this game through at least two more times. I will probably come back to it over and over for years to come. Highly recommended and worth it."

A simple if not stunning strategy game that pulls you through a WW2-esque story. Valkyria Chronicles delivers a rich storytelling enviroment with solid gameplay that will keep you playing for hours.  Pros -Multiple ways to complete each mission -Tech trees that allow different playing styles to succeed -A whole list of characters that you'll soon grow attached to (CAUTION PERMADEATH IS POSSIBLE)  Cons -Movement mechanic has a sharp learning curve that will leave you in some hairy situations until you get used to the distances characters travel

Because it is. This cell style looks good no matter how old it is. The visual style is sorely missed in later Valkyria games.  TL;DR Fantastic game would 10/10 recommend."
"A beautiful game, it's a fun and quite tough strategy war game. You control individual units on the battlefeild and they can die PERMANENTLY.  Story 9/10 Replayability 10/10 Voice/Music 10/10 Graphics 10/10 Gameplay 10/10 Toughness Quite Tough"
"I loved every second of this game, the story, the gameplay. So much love for the game it sucks that the sequels aren't on PC"
Very good underappreciated game
Oh my god a sega game that's actualy good!?!?!?
"Good tactical game from SEGA, it's a bit hard though for me"
" http://youtu.be/54eX92LA3hI   Valkyria Chronicles definitely needs to be part of your library if you’re into strategy games. Even though it’s a well-known title, it’s certainly deserving of praise. Plus, I don’t usually get the chance to play good games on the show, and this is an all-around good time. It borrows some ideas, this is certainly true, but it also innovates on them and introduces ideas of its own, and produces an experience that I’m going to remember, and come back to for a good long while. It’s got high-marks all around, and I recommend it. A-stars. Other buzz words indicating you should play it."
Why are you readng this? PLAY THIS MASTERPIECE!
Should you buy it?  Ya
"Valkyria chronicales is an odd game to say the least. And yes it is a game about the 'Europiean' front of 'WWII' made by Japanese. Well that is kinda a lye since they made their own world for this to take place in, and there is enough world building to get away with it I do have to ask why? Maybe the dev team thought it might be to hypicraticle to make it about the acutal nazi's. The game it's self has it's ups and downs: for instance the game looks beautiful with it's picture book style asthetic, allot of the story is really well done with one moment that I thought was going to be a genaric 'Oh the enemy is just as human as us' but then a moment afterword it really knew how to twist the knife to make me really feel that moment and the game play is unique amongst turn based combat for better or wrose. The bad parts are that among it's other wise well crafted story is a character who with just a few tweeks to dialog could have been a very interesting character but I suppose the goal of the character was to show the downside to military leadership. In one scene he disrgards another another characters opinion for no reason when with just a few different lines it could have shown him as a man just trying to do his job the best he can given the circumstances. As far as the game play's fualts... Well it's biggest fualt is level design, one time spawning my tank (which I need to survive to complet the mission) in front of an anti tank cannon, or other levels which are poorly designed in other ways. I still recommend Valkyria chronicales, it does make a very interesting story that couldn't really be expressed in the real historcal world without extream changes to history. The game play is interesting, if a tad on the easy side, with allot of different sinarios to expand the game play."
"Graphics hold up amazingly regardless of age just because the water-color aesthetic is so good that the design really makes tech limitations effectively vanish. I'd even say the art and style make it even nicer to look at than many newer games.  Story is phenomenal. Kind of implemented in a way that it's mandatory, but it's engaging enough and such a major part of it that there's no reason to skip it unless someone's just apathetic towards it, in which case it's understandably not for them. Anime tropes might be offputing for some but they're not overwhelming. Lots of excellently done character development, in and out of battle, even for troops who don't really play a role in the main plot. Found myself picking 'worse' troops for my squad just because certain personalities and designs were so charming.  Loosely based on WWII, but makes the soliders feel a lot more human, and tackles the heavy subjects involved like racism much more effectively, and with a lot more power and openness, than I'd expect from a stereotypical WWII shooter.   Solid difficulty curve and fun, strategy-heavy combat throughout. Can easily sink a good number of hours into it. Ranking system incentivizes speed a little too much, but it's easy to ignore and I'd recommend doing exactly that just to get the most out of a first playthrough.   For anyone concerned about whether they'd like Tactical RPGS I'd recommend the free XCOM demo for a loose idea of what they're like, but VC is hardly expensive, especially on sale."
"A game full of character, a tue classic."
"Fantastic Game, deep and original combat system, engaging story with likable characters and hours of gameplay this is a must buy"
Valkyria Chronicles is what you get when you mix a great anime with a damn good strategy game!  It has likeable &amp; interesting characters  Looks gorgeous  A great Soundtrack  Lots of content  And addictive gameplay
"Very touching, good combat, delightfully difficult, and amazing character development...i give this game a 5/5 and would reccomend it to anyone who reads this review to give it a try."
Squad 7 move out!
"Definitely one of the games i enjoyed playing the most. The combination of RPG and turn based strategy proved to be really fun, but for me the best selling point of this game is the story. If you like story driven games(also if you like animes it's a plus in this case) this game is worth taking a look, because it has a beautiful, unique story. Hope you enjoy the game."
Amazing game! Wish the sequels would be released on pc and steam!
Prettier than a white winged gull
"This game will make you feel like a commander as in you won't want any of your comrades to die. They all have unique personalities and faults but that just makes them more human. The game play is like Fire Emblem mixed with xcom, and just as magnificent as both. Highly recommend."
"Great Story, Great Characters, Great Gameplay. Made me cry more than once (manly tears, obviously), always a plus."
"What can I say, great game, runs smoothly on pc, and is 20 dollars with all the DLC included. Was gonna buy a copy for ps3 (I no longer have one) but this saves me money :D  Lots of fun, a turn based shooter with some real time and fps elements mixed into it. Units have personalities, preferences, phobias, and even work better with characters they like.   Edit: Some of the cutscenes seem a bit laggy, don't recall if it was the same way on ps3, not my machine since there's no dropped frames according to the counter."
This game was the best I have played in ages. A really great turn based ww2 fantasy tactical game. Interesting story and a real bargain too :) If you like UFO Enemy Unknown or Fire Emblem then this game is for you.
"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this game?  Story: Fantastic writing, and while at the first glance is a Anime War-Game, you will find yourself caring about nearly every soldier under your command, as they are individuals and not just 'Faceless Mook #13'. If you are one that can actually care about people, this game will make you cry. [I'll admit that it gets me everytime during a certain part of the story, even though I know it's coming.]  Gameplay: If you're the type of person that is turned off by Turn-Based strategy because it doesn't let your units fight back, don't worry, the 'Blitz' engine turned that on its head. If you are of the tactics school: 'Fire and Maneuver', welcome to your new crack.  [Note: This game can be addictive, I nearly got demoted because I forgot to go to work while playing this game.]"
"Great game, glade it came to pc"
10/10 alicia has big boobs 
"It took a lot of effort from me to uninstall this because I couldn't stop playing. It gets a tick in every department I can think of- gameplay, story, characters, art style, presentation, soundtrack etc. I like the refreshing take on tactical turn based gameplay done in real time 3rd person, allowing you to move, shoot, heal etc. There are other factors involved too which gives this system some good complexity and really spices things up. The story is simple on paper like most things out there but it's what happens along the way which keep you engaged. I felt attached to all the main characters in this and I really liked how the game explored these people's personalities and journeys, offering some really good character development and interaction. The only issues I have with the game is that there is a lot of dialogue at times (like how there is always a conversation at the start of a battle) and watching everything the enemy does in their turn can feel like a drag and overly long at times. This could be rectified by having a 'rush' option some games have which fast forwards their moves at a decent rate. Other than that however, I'm REALLY satisfied with the game overall and it's definitely one of my favorite games of all time. I thoroughly recommed getting this game, which was originally a PS3 exclusive so you should be thankful for something like this happening as console exclusivity is moaned about a lot.  All in all, I'm gonna give this a 10 because it's so good it makes me want to give it a 10."
What are you even doing reading the reviews. This is an insta-purchase quality port.
"Excellent gameplay, good music, interesting art style in game and in story book mode, emotional story with memorable characters. Didn’t expect much when I first saw this game, but I enjoyed it very much and competed it 3 times now. Oh and I recommend playing with Japanese audio so you can hear the amazing voice actors, more than a few are quite famous."
Such a amazing game if you love anime and love turn based games this is for you. I loved the story and voice actors I thought it was cool Welkins voice actor also copied Takumi Fujiwara initial D. I love everything about this game actually really challenging at times although that got me even more hooked and determined to finish it. A must by. Shia Labeouf says JUST DOOO IT!

Oh my god a sega game that's actualy good!?!?!?
"Good tactical game from SEGA, it's a bit hard though for me"
"Good guy SEGA releases game with all DLC's included instead of selling the DLC's separately.  Also, it's nice to see a good PC port with support for higher resolution and more FPS.  As for the actual game: an anime tactical RPG set in an alternate world where World War II has just started. If you like tactical combat and/or anime games, I recommend you give this a game a try."
Excellent tactical turn based RPG. Had a blast with it on PS3 and It's even better on PC.
My waifu now has ptsd.... and I guess the holocaust happened or whatever. 10/10
"I have not completed the campain yet (getting close - I'm taking my time with it and have spent 63 hours in the game this far), but this is a great game. I was worried that the real time parts of the turned based gameplay wouldn't suit me (I can't handle shooters), and it was slightly disorienting at first, but after the first two battles, I'd gotten the hang of it.  It is fun to play, and I also find the characters engaging."
"Very enjoyable RPG turn based strategy game. The story is nice though not really unqiue. The characters have some depth, though they are a bit on the shallow side. The game is addicting, and makes you want to play more to find out what happens. The only minus is that enemy turn is unskipable, and with large enough enemies it takes ages for the enemy to play."
"Personaly, I do recommend this game to anyone who likes turn based strat games, its a blast"
"This game really needs an autosave feature.  Game hangs several times now to which I losses the xp and upgrades I did which is very annoying as I need to do it all over again from the previous saves. If you don't save often, then your out of luck as you need to do it all oven again from your last save game.  Saving everytime takes the fun out of this bloody good game."
"If the AI for this game had been great instead of terrible, this game would be a masterpiece. It's got a CP system that actually works, you can choose to attack with the same unit 10 times in a single turn, but you usually don't because of interesting complexities in board state that require you to counter various things using a wide assortment of units. It's sort of like Chess, except the reasons you don't move your Queen every turn (enemies can often easily dodge a single attacker, your own pawns get underfoot, and attacking units can't really use hit-and-run tactics) don't apply here, and instead, every unit is a very different kind of Queen in its own right.  Unfortunately, the AI is seriously brain-damaged with flashes of mild competence, the worst combination. When the enemy actually remembers to attack with the same unit more than once in a turn, it's often a surprise, and sometimes results in instant defeat. The enemy often spends its time walking units back and forth out in the middle of nowhere, running up in front of your tank and getting mowed down, and ending its turn even though it has tons of CP left and hasn't really done anything of note this turn yet.  The dialogue in this game is a bit hypermundane in places too, although I did slightly warm up to the plot at about chapter 7 or so."
Amazing game! Great artwork and a really unique experience. It reminds me of Resonance of Fate. I wish that game was on PC!   Hear me SEGA???
Fan SRPS !!!! You need to get this game :3 !!!!1 Best in ever :3 !!!!!
"I know steam says I didn't play much, but I don't have to have to form my opinion of this seeing as I played it on the PS3 when it came out some time ago.   So let's take what's new with the game when it comes to it comes to windows. Let me just say this is as solid a port as you can possibly get and it runs like a dream. There isn't much to go by in the configuration menu as it only gives you the option of resolution, refresh rate, and vysnc but you're not going to need alot of settings to be able to enjoy this as it was meant to be from the start.   The game itself stays much the same. In it you are a ragtag group of enlistees in a nation's army which is on the brink of defeat from an invading empire. You do what you do to try to come out on top an explore the lore of the land as there are supernatural events aswell. In each stage you are given a map where upon selecting the unit everything flips to 3rd person shooter where you move the selected character around to take out enemies. All the models have weak spots and trajectories so it's pretty well thought out.   The story is pretty generic war time anime stuff like you've seen before with the token pacifist and love interest and some ancient catastrophe with magic crap. You can't expect much more from japan to be honest, but give it some slack because this was made back when japan use to make ACTUAL games that were ACTUALLY good unlike now were we are forced to have 1 game from Platinum and 1 game from Kojima a year and have to ignore 8 billion fisher price colored nintendo kiddie dribble trashcan destined games for the rest of the time.   All in all I recommend!"
"I said to myself that I wasn't going to get this port; but I'd be hard-pressed to say I'm thankful to have this port.  Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing turn-based game series that deserves to be seen and played by all. I highly recommend the game to anyone who is genuinely interested into trying it out; it is a fantastic game when I first played it on the consoles.   Over-all, this is on my personal list of great PC ports. SEGA, if you somehow read this, I'd appreciate seeing the sequels ported to PC one day alongside other SEGA games."
Very nice story and tactical combat. Thanks to this game I decided to try XCOM and fell in love with it :)  Now after hunderds of hours in XCOM and XCOM 2 I can tell that Valkyria Chronicles much inferior in terms of tactical gameplay but I would still recommend it due to appealing story and characters.
"well its a turned based game where you get to control the members of your team and super powers, tanks and even a stealth mission. get it"
+ Deep Story + Fairly good gameplay  - Uneven difficulty in main and optional chapters - Scouts are op
"Watch alicias hot ♥♥♥ shoot dudes down while welkins sitting inside the tank doing god knows what. 100/10 would watch anime ♥♥♥ again nah but fo real doe The story is great, as far as japanese games go. To a lot the story could be seen as a hinderence, seeing as how cutscenes there are in the game. For gameplay, the difficulty starts off pretty light, then takes a turn around the 6th or 7th chapter. To alot of people this could be a turn off since there are so many '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t' moves or units the enemy has such as a huge ♥♥♥ tank whose weakness can only be known if you survive some turns, but what really kept me going was the likable characters(again likable for anime), amazing soundtrack, and interesting story that doesnt go too far into the stupid unrealistic anime cliches, but also keeps itself original and not into too much of a boring WWII history lesson TL;DR Buy if you can like Xcom or even Fire Emblem Dont buy if you cant stand anime artstyle  also Jap subs 4 lyfe m8"
You like games where every unit has its own personality and is important for the mission and you like it when the game is bringing you to the edge of your mental capability? Well if no then don't buy this cause this is nothing for you.  RIP Marina  got a headshot by a tank over the whole map

"now im doing this before i even play. I know sounds dumb. But, ive played this many many times one my ps3. i can't tell you how much you should get this. but I can try.   The game is very well made with a great look. its a game where you have to plan out all your moves and also make sure that you dont send one person charging in themselfs. it is a game where you have to really think about who you take into the fight with you. each person has their own skills and people they fight well with and people they just hate.  one solder I used hates rose. so everytime she is near her she will lose chances of hitting people.  Also as you play. you get a real feel of the people that you use. you start to feel like you have to do everything you can to make sure they live. sometimes it doesnt work.   yes people can die in this game no you cant revive them.  This game has been my top game ever since i first played it.  46/46"
"1 line version: The only RPG that the strongest woman in the game ends up in the kitchen. 8/10  Full Version: [This review has some minor spoilers about the game]  Well, if you're reading this, Valkyria Chronicles (or Senjou no Valkyria, in Japanese) has already picked your interest. Be it because some of your friends have, or because of the massive amount of people who liked it, because you like RPGs and want something fresh or because Sega has some broad range games that commonly goes on sale. Either way, VC is a prime example of how RPGs can still evolve and implement new things without sacrificing the story-telling.  STORY The story revolves around a conflict between nations during the Second European War (EWII), in which nations of the Empire (East) and the Federation (West) battles between each other for power, territory and resources. One specific nation, Gallia, tries its best to remain neutral, but it is still taken amidst the conflict with the invasion of the Empire forces. Welkin Gunther, the main protagonist, is one of the inhabitants that is caught on this invasion in his home city, Bruhl, but with the guidance of Alicia Melchiott, the town watch captain, they manage to evacuate the city to the capital city of Randgriz. There, they join (compulsorily) the 7th squadron of the town's militia, and from then on you must complete some missions that end up engulfing the entire squadron against the Empire's best forces, including even a Valkyria, a being of mystical powers that can basically one-shot-kill tanks and is virtually invincible.  It has loads of references to WWII and Cold War in real life: alliances battling for oil (or, in this case, ragnite); wanting other nations to join their cause (and even deal with backstabbing); massive destruction weapons (did I hear nuclear bomb?) and, of course, the sense that stronger weapons and more soldier numbers meaning better army getting crushed with intelligence and strategy. Some Japanese elements are still there to soften the mood sometimes, but be sure, the story itself is marvelous.  Along those lines, an obvious love story evolves between Welkin and Alicia, but in a heartwarming and slow way instead of it being rubbed in your face every mission. Even if some plot points you can see from miles away, some are genuinely breathtaking (like one of your squad members that is killed along the main plot). The main story has some 20 chapters neatly divided as sub-chapters of a book, each containing a certain cutscene or sequence of dialogues... oh, and the book wasn't a figure of speech, you can even change tabs if you want to read more about the squad members, weapons, cities and even see some side events.  GAMEPLAY I was really impressed when I read 'mix of real and turn-based strategy RPG' on the game's description, but it's exactly how you play in every mission. Basicaly you are the commander who can spend command points (CP) to control individual units around the battlefield (that can suffer damage if nearby units or turrets see you while you move), but once you raise your sights to aim at the enemy, all enemy units halt their actions and it works like a 1vs1 battle.  There are lots of mechanics between my explanation, really: your unit consumes AP points (which differs from each class) to move around, and once it depletes, you'll be stuck; you can move units multiple times, but you must spend a CP everytime you want to move a unit, and as you select the same unit over and over, their available AP drops, meaning they're getting tired and will walk less further; you have classes that counters each other (shocktroopers deals lots of damage to less defensive classes like Scouts, but they also have less AP than Scouts; Lancers are good against tanks, but are slow and have low accuracy; Snipers deal tremendous headshot damage but are also slow and fragile; engineers can disable mines and heal tanks, but aren't good at the battlefront), along with RPG elements like status ailments and 'orders' that can raise units status briefly. It's really complex, but the game introduces those mechanics little by little, so you'll have plenty of time to practice and master those. Just be sure to save inside missions, as some of them can easily take up over an hour depending on your luck.  THE GOOD  - Dual audio available with English subtitles  - The sense of danger and challenge of the missions  - Plentiful of things to do with EXP and money earned  - Combat feels balanced for the most part  - The story (and the satisfying ending!)  - Quite a few things to do and read besides the main story  - Around 20-30 hours of gameplay just for the main story  THE BAD  - No online play  - Some plot points are just rubbed on your face too much (yes, that member that dies)  - Not saving inside missions can lead to frustration due to bad unit positioning  - Luck is quite a factor to be considered in this game (from acurracy of shots to enemy unit spawn)  - Takes a little while for you to become used to the terms and political movements  - It feels like some missions must be started a couple of times to get the hang of what exatcly you must do and how fast to proceed  - I WANT A VALKYRIA UNIT TO OWN EVERYONE ELSE!!  OVERALL 8/10 An awesome story, equally nice combat mechanics, sense of challenge in almost every mission and the broad range of things to be done and accomplishments to... erm... accomplish, Valkyria Chronicles is a must for every RPG lover, or even those who don't like sole turn-based strategy games. Definitely worth buying even without any multiplayer (because, really, if it existed, each game would take up hours easily). Just keep your eyes peeled in case the PSP exclusive's Valkyria Chronicles 2 is ever ported to PC, because it's even better!!"
"One of the best games I've ever played. Rich narrative, gorgeous visuals, strong mechanics and all in an excellent port.  It's more than worth the $20 price tag; don't be turned away because it's a port of a six year old game; besides the video cutscenes, which are a little grainy, the game looks wonderful on my 1920x1080 monitor."
It's Beetle-tastic!
"One of my favorite games of all time. I played this to death on the ps3. I am thoroughly enjoying this on the pc, only one crash so far (I alt tabbed during a cutscene so it was my fault)"

Decent port from PS to PC
"This is a review intended to previous owners of the game on the PS3 version. It may still help you decide if you're interested in the game all-together.  Here we go. First review in quite awhile.  Valkyria Chronicles was an early PS3 game that was well known for it's twist on a tactics game; being somewhat of a third person shooter at the same time. You had to think out every move, and make them count as a Militia squad of Galia against the massive army of the empire.   The story is amazing to this game. It makes you feel immersed as the struggles continues. The gameplay will make you think twice about your actions in the field, and consider what's best for your hand-picked team to do.  'But how's the new pc port? Is it the same as the PS3?' Early on the release on steam, there were a few problems here and there. Although with the patches that came quickly to the game's aid, nearly all of the cons about the port were fixed. Pros: - Now supports 60FPS and above. - New higher resolution support. - Keyboard and Gamepad support. (360 buttons also patched in to replace the original PS3 buttons.) - All DLC included. - Permanent price reduction compared to the original.  Cons: - Enemy reaction shots are much more agressive than intended at anything above 30FPS. Some people say they enjoy this change, but as this is a mixed feeling it's recommended that newcomers play at the original 30FPS for an easier time.  So, all in all, after the small bumps in the road of bringing this to the PC, it's an amazing port. In my opinion, a game completely worth the time you put into it."
"very fun, like the graphics."
buy + play this Good game thanks
Decent port from PS to PC
"This is a review intended to previous owners of the game on the PS3 version. It may still help you decide if you're interested in the game all-together.  Here we go. First review in quite awhile.  Valkyria Chronicles was an early PS3 game that was well known for it's twist on a tactics game; being somewhat of a third person shooter at the same time. You had to think out every move, and make them count as a Militia squad of Galia against the massive army of the empire.   The story is amazing to this game. It makes you feel immersed as the struggles continues. The gameplay will make you think twice about your actions in the field, and consider what's best for your hand-picked team to do.

"I know steam says I didn't play much, but I don't have to have to form my opinion of this seeing as I played it on the PS3 when it came out some time ago.   So let's take what's new with the game when it comes to it comes to windows. Let me just say this is as solid a port as you can possibly get and it runs like a dream. There isn't much to go by in the configuration menu as it only gives you the option of resolution, refresh rate, and vysnc but you're not going to need alot of settings to be able to enjoy this as it was meant to be from the start.   The game itself stays much the same. In it you are a ragtag group of enlistees in a nation's army which is on the brink of defeat from an invading empire. You do what you do to try to come out on top an explore the lore of the land as there are supernatural events aswell. In each stage you are given a map where upon selecting the unit everything flips to 3rd person shooter where you move the selected character around to take out enemies. All the models have weak spots and trajectories so it's pretty well thought out.   The story is pretty generic war time anime stuff like you've seen before with the token pacifist and love interest and some ancient catastrophe with magic crap. You can't expect much more from japan to be honest, but give it some slack because this was made back when japan use to make ACTUAL games that were ACTUALLY good unlike now were we are forced to have 1 game from Platinum and 1 game from Kojima a year and have to ignore 8 billion fisher price colored nintendo kiddie dribble trashcan destined games for the rest of the time.   All in all I recommend!"
"I said to myself that I wasn't going to get this port; but I'd be hard-pressed to say I'm thankful to have this port.  Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing turn-based game series that deserves to be seen and played by all. I highly recommend the game to anyone who is genuinely interested into trying it out; it is a fantastic game when I first played it on the consoles.   Over-all, this is on my personal list of great PC ports. SEGA, if you somehow read this, I'd appreciate seeing the sequels ported to PC one day alongside other SEGA games."
"Great Story, Great Characters, Great Gameplay. Made me cry more than once (manly tears, obviously), always a plus."
"What can I say, great game, runs smoothly on pc, and is 20 dollars with all the DLC included. Was gonna buy a copy for ps3 (I no longer have one) but this saves me money :D  Lots of fun, a turn based shooter with some real time and fps elements mixed into it. Units have personalities, preferences, phobias, and even work better with characters they like.   Edit: Some of the cutscenes seem a bit laggy, don't recall if it was the same way on ps3, not my machine since there's no dropped frames according to the counter."
This game was the best I have played in ages. A really great turn based ww2 fantasy tactical game. Interesting story and a real bargain too :) If you like UFO Enemy Unknown or Fire Emblem then this game is for you.
its.. addicting.. kinda like an easy going xcom
"Dear GOD.  Teenagers. And a war that is perpetually clean. Even the dust and rubble are clean. Even blood and wounds look clean. EVERYTHING LOOKS CLEAN!  What kind of a war is this?!  That being said, the game mechanics' new take on the turn-based tactics thing is quite refreshing. Still...  ...TEENAGERS!!! We have a pubescent girl leading two older men, one of which get's killed like a true tertiary extra. And that's from the first chapters! Cringy.  Well, what do you expect from an anime?    UPDATE: The music, now that I've been playing it for a bit, has a...'Band Of Brothers' vibe to it. Orchestral, yet has anime-ish trimmings around the edges. Helps the player get into the mood. Then again, anime games tend to have awesome music."
When scouts more effective at mid-range than troopers.  10/10 would add scopes.
"  DOPE!!  The gameplay system feels good and actually fun to play this game need a good strategy to play.. if u ♥♥♥♥ up your strategy your team will be gone in 1-3 turn.. the story are good.. and you need grinding some exp,weapon and money if you want to get A rank in every mission some enemies are too hard but you can beat it with proper equipment and strategy.."
I bought this game as a filler game to play when non of my buddies were on and i felt like drinking. At first i thought this might be decent and got it during a sale. Honestly after playing it for a few days straight i realized this game is F*****g awesome!! It has a pretty dam good story and it was the right ammount of challenging. I got way more than i expected from this game and i think anyone contimplating buying this game should!
"I was a long time old school gamer just getting back into gaming now, and this was a very enjoyable turn based rpg..reminding me of the old time Vandal hearts, but with a really great story, and cel shaded graphics. The difficulty on some of the later missions is challenging, but fun. Another game this reminded me of was fire emblem, so if that was your kind of gaming, you might want to give this one a try. =)"
Edy is best girl.
"Amazing Pc port, great k/m controls, great optimization/perfomance, original fun, now lets hope they bring 3/azure to pc !"
"O MY GOD... Love this game, Watched the anime loved it, saw it was a game... 10/10 would fap to"
Great game and well worth full price but in a sale it's a steal if you like turn based RTS/RPG with a rich story it's pretty good.
"After the death of Private 1st Class Edy, I as a commander made a vow to never let such a tragedy befall my squad and ended the war with not another casualty. Overall, the game has great turned based strategy, anyone who also enjoys Fire Emblem would also enjoy this as well. Rip in pizza Edy."
"Let me start with age-old sentence. This game was under my radar for long time, until it became game on my radar, but never on top priority list. Then voucher popped in my inventory and tought to finally try it out. At time of writing this review, im just 5,3 hours in and im still what feels very much in beginning. And this game is fantastic. Despite its cheerful looks, it also has dark side, as well as rather complex and interesting gameplay. Only real gripe i have is with using a tank. Though if you look for lot of action, you might not also like it, as it has LOT of story. Gameplay wise, one other thing needs mentioning: while it is fairly well ported, you can get somewhat confused at start by controls. But be assured- you can get over it fairly quickly (except mentioned tank).  As for story? Well, its set in fictional world, where continent named Europa is in 2nd great war in 1935. While war is between 2 major alliances, Gallia is small country thats neutral. But one side- the empire (which i find great that it is based on both starters of ww2 (signers of molotov-ribbentrop pact), not just one)- decides to attack Gallia. And even with just those 5,3 hours, i've found several themes, that make it easier for me to relate my nations history (not as lucky as Gallia in ww2).  EDIT: 10,3 hours in and story just keeps getting better."

"Good guy SEGA releases game with all DLC's included instead of selling the DLC's separately.  Also, it's nice to see a good PC port with support for higher resolution and more FPS.  As for the actual game: an anime tactical RPG set in an alternate world where World War II has just started. If you like tactical combat and/or anime games, I recommend you give this a game a try."
My waifu now has ptsd.... and I guess the holocaust happened or whatever. 10/10
"This game is the definition of polish. It's got a good story. It has good combat and leveling system, the leveling is a tad slow but the missions make up for it. As soon as you figure out the tank controls, and notice that pushing W to go forward and moving your mouse turns the tank you'll be fine. You can also just use WASD to move the tank around, just don't touch the mouse for that.   I would suggest you buy this game right now, it's amazing."
"ok this is an anime type style game. Alicia is 19 for those who keep asking. yes the uniforms are different but who cares. its a freaking video game not real life. I've seen people argue about this. you get skirmishes challenges and the campaign to do battles. Cover is very important whether its hiding behind your tank to a sandbag.   if you're not careful you could lose your toons if not fail if Welkin dies. Tanks have a weak spot in the back that a simple lancer, tank or even anti-tank gun can usually 1 shot you. so its important to place your units carefully."
Best game ever. Why because it makes you suffer and laugh and it is visually striking. There are moments when you just want to give up but you just want to tell how the story ends
"For a game with a light-hearted anime setting, this game sure touches on some sensitve issues like suicide bombing, Arbeit macht frei, and most importantly...  Iyaaahn Largo-sama &lt;3!!"
"Mindless fanboys and downvoters are not welcome. Read on only if you actually are interested in what I have to say.  Valkyria Chronicles by its anime adaptation and slightly belated PC portover from the consoles it was originally made to run on is without a doubt one of the better known Japanese games on the Western market with a fairly significant fanbase, and at first glance seemingly well deserved reputation. Shortly after the initial release on Steam, it quickly became popular even among those who have never heard of it before for the setting it takes place in and a peculiar kind of gameplay people often liken to other titles such as the X-COM series. Unfortunately however, while it does have its good points, it is not a masterpiece which only becomes appearant later on.  It all begins with a short but very atmospheric introduction to the story taking place in an alternate timeline, where political struggles and frequent conflicts over the dwindling supplies of a precious resource lead to increasing tensions between the major powers of Europa, either side only waiting for the moment to strike at the other. A conflict which may seem insignificant to those involved in it on the surface, but in a single moment may become the flame that engulfs everything, leaving the ones facing their adversary with seemingly no choice but to surrender. Unless something that counters the invading forces breaks to the surface, a power that transcends the mists of time and within hold the key not only to our oldest legacies, but to who we are as well.  FIRE ONE: COMBAT  Likely not a surprise to say that either in games or elsewhere when you try to shoot someone, they shoot back. This is one of the first points where VC falls short on expectations, because due to some strange design consideration the moment you pick up your weapon, the AI stops completely, allowing you to take your time aiming before emptying the magazine into their heads, sometimes from point blank range. Even more interesting is the fact that 3 out of 5 classes will NEVER try to resist even if you are right in front of them, further emphasizing the problem. It is also possible and a known exploit to position your troops in a way that will make the AI shoot its own soldiers, since the inherently flawed script cares not if anything happens to be in the way when they attack. One could certainly find this amusing since it gives the player many opportunities to have a good laugh, but after a few times it just becomes sad, especially since many hail this as one of the best features it has.  FIRE TWO: PSEUDO RPG  Another prominent feature is VC's own version of the classic level up system which rewards XP and credits at the end of a mission, that can be used to upgrade units in the training grounds or the garage. The problem with this is the fact that instead of individual units the game raises the stats of entire classes at once there leading to another serious exploit, since by grinding a class challenge from early on in the game you can farm ridiculous amounts of XP and funds which quite literally turns otherwise precious reward into a cheap currency that can be amassed as long as one likes. You also get near limitless access to one of the most powerful scout rifles you can find and enough money to buy everything from the shop for the tanks without ever being close to running low, meaning you can blitz through most if not all missions without much effort even at the very end of the story. Then we also have the characters who make up Squad 7 with all sorts of interesting backgrounds, which may give the impression that they are all unique sorts of people. They are not. The traits unlocked at various stages are all variations of the same copypasted abilities, some of which are gamebreakingly strong once invoked randomly or by orders, while others make half the cast a liability, never to see the day they sortie. This is especially obvious with Alicia who can win any mission that doesn't necessitate tank hunters by herself, with complete disregard to enemy fire ranging from infantry rifles to heavy machine guns. No matter how one would try to explain this, it is a very poor design, killing any semblance of challenge and realism especially when the infamous tactic known as scout rush is involved too.  FIRE THREE: THE PLAN  Since the game rates one's success not by how effectively they complete the operation but by how many turns it takes, it pretty much forces the player to hurry as much as possible regardless of danger if they want to get the related achievements. The problem with this is that without advance knowledge of the enemy positions there's little chance of getting A rank on a mission because the tactical map is worthless and until visual contact there's no way to predict what's behind the next corner. As a result the player could get caught in a crossfire out of nowhere anytime, leading to significant delays or possibly loss of troops if you're not quick enough. It is worth to mention that not even fatal head injuries will kill friendly units outright so long as they get a medic which can't be said about the enemy. There's also the random nature of this game which is the epitome of chaos theory itself with complex mathematical factors inconceivable to mortal men influencing the AI's decision on where to direct every bullet and artillery shell, sometimes right on target, other times going way off the map. On the other hand, if you happen to find just the right spot and direction, it's possible to destroy several targets without actually engaging them, relying solely on shots that were not supposed to happen. The finishing blow is that while some Gallians can be incapacitated by enemy fire, everybody seems to be immune to runovers from tanks, as any attempt from doing so will only shove them to the side. Most unusual, given what a vehicle of such proportions can do.  FIRE FOUR: PLOTHOLES  While it may be more noticable to some it should still be mentioned how many plotholes and openly presented deus ex machinas can be found here at closer look, turning an atmospheric story into one of great disappointment. These are but a few, as listing all of them would fill a smaller phone book. The Edelweiss. I'm fairly certain no army would just let a civilian keep a functional tank in their garage with fuel AND ammunition to boot. The ingame explanation for that is insufficient since designing a vehicle doesn't mean they get to keep one. Especially this kind. In a certain battle one character curb stomps another without even breaking a sweat. There's no logical or even illogical explanation for that to happen with the exception of being protected by plot armor, since the scenario writer decided to make that loss a focal point in the story, regardless of how unreasonable it is.  FIRE FIVE: BEHIND HER BLUE FLAME  The only saving grace of VC at this point is Selvaria's mini campaign which lets the player take control of her and a small Imperial unit around the fortress of Ghirlandaio. It is everything the main storyline should have been actually challenging, a sense of accomplishment and the final mission which could bring tears of joy to the eyes of those who can appreciate it. The difference in quality is so stark, it couldn't be more obvious and raises the question of why not making a storyline for each side, one from Squad 7 and the other from Selvaria's viewpoint. It would have alleviated much of the misgivings about this game without actually giving victory to the Empire.  Valkyria, valkyria  As promising as it started out Sega's popular title turned into only a mere shadow of what it could have been, giving up the possibility of a great chronicle for a game of superficiality that leaves a different kind of lasting impression. Therefore, one should be careful with their expectations before playing it, lest they become disappointed. Only buy it when on sale and only after giving careful consideration."
Best game ever. Why because it makes you suffer and laugh and it is visually striking. There are moments when you just want to give up but you just want to tell how the story ends
"was fun, but I needed a lot of time to play it, mainly for the episodes, and not battles, but other than that I think this is the best game i've played!"
such a wonderful game i love it so much
"great porting, anime style, beauty female character, and personally i love tactical action gameplay"
"I normally HATE this kinda stuff. But being a fan of Xcom I thought I'd try it out. its pretty good, no overly anime crap but some good solid gameplay. 7/10."
"First things first, this is a good game: But one that is hardly woreth all the praise it got. I will begin by listing the thing that i dislked and therefore do not allow me to reccomend it:   *No Autosave: This is no primitive title and lack of automated save can give the unaware player plenty of nasty surprises, In a game with permadeath this is almost unforgivable, and there is also no option to restart missions unless you faiL, which coupled with some of the game`s other flaws can turn it intoa very frustrating experience  *Clumsy Tank Controls: Despite being WWII inspired, Tank Warare in Valkyria Chronicles more closely rememble WWI tank warfare: Tanks are sluggish and their primary function is bascally work as mobile cover, Anti-Tank Infantry does a better job at dealing with enemy armor. being as cumbersome as thy are, Tanks are also very difficult to control, and that can prove really inconvenient due to fact that turning also consumes Action Points. That and the fact that losing you main tank commander leads to an auto-fail is perfect mix for disaster  *Unflexible-Uninteresting Soldier Classes: Foot Soldiers in Valkyria Chronicles are divided into Five Classes (Engineers, Scouts, Shocktroopers, Anti-Tank Soldiers, Snipers) all with their own set of abilities which are crucial for battlefield success...or so it would seem. Problem with soldier classes is that they what they suppose to do AND NOTHING ELSE, they have no secondary weaponry, and the game heavily encourage the use of particular set iof soldiers for a certain missions. While you take your pic of grunts to the battlefield, the doesn`t really encourage a combined arms aproach: spamming the right type of soldier can allow to breeze through missions unopposed.  *Poor Teamwork: the above beign said, the also promotes reliance on individual soldiers, circumstances that will require to manuver with your whole squad are rare and chances are that throughout a mission, out of 15 soldiers, you will end up using just 3 or 4. The game has a 'comradeship system' as some soldiers like (or dislike) some embers of the squad and can perform team Attacks with their buddies: but your will neraly never use those as all you need to do bring even the stauchest of infrantry if to throw some grenades and then shoot them to the face  The System is broken, given how Anti-Tank Troopers and Snipers donpt participate on team Attacks even with the prople they like which makes this affinity pointless in them.    *Poor cover system: The only thing that offers real cover in this game are sandbags, which will grant you defensive bonuses even if flanked. On the other hand concrete walls, ancient ruins, or even immovile tanks will only stop atacks if they coming from the direction they facing and they not negate flanking attacks: something sandbags for some unholy reason do.  *War Story?: Make no mistake the story is enjoyable but...is no war story, not by a long shot. That, or it is REALLY bad one. The game would greatly benefitted from a slightly darker tone, because it really had grea potential on it`s theme: You are the impromptu commander of hastly assembled Militia Squad of a small country that must repel the overwelming invasion of vastly superior foe.  The problem is...Well, there almost no instances in which you are reminded that you are at war, the game is too bright and colorful for that, the characters are cheerful, way too likeble and lack complexity (except from a moment of bigotry here and there) There are no visceral moments, which is waste consdering that allegedly most of your grunts were models, Bakery`s workers, Bar workers, students, teachers, JUST NORMAL PEOPLE just a couple of weeks ago. You will not seemthem having emotional breadowns, no 'IT`S GAME OVER, MAN, GAME OVER!' meltdowns or anything of the sort which kinda breaks the immersion: You could tell that you are Militia but because they tell you are, you could be The Expendables of this universe and would still make sense  There is no feeling of dread or that your fighting against a military juggernaut. There is no reaction to casualties or the other realities of war (because they are no really presented in the game) and therefore the characters have to reason to grown up and become more matured, I understand the angle gameplays: That of common day people who rise to become the reluctant heroes against impossible odds but the mood doensn`t help, characters never mature and there is no transition from zero to hero.  Now, the game do some things right: It`s visually beatiful(speacially if you into Anime), it`s blend of fantasy and technology is interesting, there plenty of upgrades and customziation you Tank of the Main Character and something that Valkyria Chronicles does better than similar games (such as XCOM) is that it manages to give all the avaible grunts some entity: all of them have perks, les/islikes, that are unique to them and of them have their own character models and backgrounds which is awesome and is nie break from XCOM geenrical cannonfodder.  But in the end, i cannpt avoid feeling that could have been so much more: The ideas are there, the concepts are there, it has all the minderals to achieve it, but somewhere int he execution fell shot: not too short, but short nevertheles. You should acquire it if youa re willing to appreacite for what it is: a nice turn-based tactical game with a no-so-convencing story which leans more towards idealism rather dirt and blood game, in that case I suggest you Company of Heroes or XCOM 2          "
"My first playthrough:  'How did they kill my scout!'  'Where did that lancer come from?'  'I am literally in a guys face and he ducks my shot'  'AHHHHH.... SHE ONE SHOT MY TANK!!!!!'  'Why can't I move my tank?'  'I question why they dont just shoot her'  'NOOOOOOOOO'  'I hate and love this writer'  'YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'  'They have all of thos machine guns and they can't...... WTF is that on the left???'  Now, here's the second playthrough:  'MC Hammer Start playing'  'My one character wiped out your entire squad'  'You lancers cant hit the broad side of a barn'  'My lancer just sniped your tank'  'My sniper literally can't be hit by anything because their so far away'  'Record Scratches'  'She still one shot my tank'  'My lancers are no longer snipers'  'A dust allergey ended a perfect game'  'Where did that mine come from'  'My sniper missed'  'My tank is stuck on a rock.... again'  In the end, Catherine has 100 confirmed kills My scouts can fight an entire enemy batalion One shock tropper=complete control of camp My one engineer can take no damage, another hits harder the less life they have, and another basically told me to go to hell.  10/10 would never put Hermes in charge of repairing my tanks again.

you gotta shoot the bad guys and not die.
A good game with a good story. Only thing i didnt like was how short the game was and how silly the final battle was.  The graphics are nice and the animation is pretty. The gameplay itself is brilliantly done  I wished Valkyia 2 would come to pc but sadly they wont

Love this game. I really want more games like this.
"A musthave game. Practically anime with a decent story (could be better though, it's mostly cliche and seen 100s of times, but is well executed) with strategical maps you need to win (turnbased). I'm not sure for what reason Sega waited so many years to release it on PC.  Menus are crying for mouse support, but it's nothing very bad. Otherwise the port is impressive. Worth every penny."

"Played this on the PS3 and played the PC version for only the DLC while I also played a few chapters to get back the feeling on how the game worked.  Its one of the best games I played on the PS3. Its closest game I can compare is XCOM.  The only thing 'bad' I would say is that the Rating system (on some stages) is designed to make you play the game without actually enjoying it. It forces the player to be precise with its actions and actually disregarding your main force and to use only a few characters. to be as efficient as possible.  For example in the DLC the only way to be Rank A on your 1st playthrough is to know already that one of the characters you are using MUST already be on the other side of the Map. You literaaly have no reason to even go there but as soon as the story tells you, your rank is already degraded to B."

"Nice piece of Turn Base Strategy game.... and good story too.. Cons (Because it's F*ckin Annoy me so much) -Tank Control can be a LITTLE BIT shaky (And with that looonnggg Movement bar ,it really helps A LOT) scenario:  -Got to use tank for the first time  -'FU*K YEAH NOW WERE TALKIN!!!'  -Moving the tank by using W and Hold it  -The Tank Got Shaky when the bar is half empty  -The tank just turn right by itself  -'WADE*AK!!! THIS ROUND HAVE A TURN LIMIT YOU BI*CH' -Enemy Health can a little bit frustating. Other game like this usually make enemy health bar A LOT diffrent from our troops. Well this game made their health bars almost similar to yours ,AND ITS FRUSTATING!!! oke oke... maybe it is a challenge? yeah challenge ,you only have squad filled with 1 tank and about 5-7 infantry with their own class health vs 20 and + 2-4 Tanks + even some fu*in atillery can be a little overwhelming. I mean cmon ,i know this is a challenge but you couldn't kill a scout just like you did killin those 3 health enemy in XCOM (Except for XCOM 2. Seen the screenshot ,WEW 60% from 1cm distance..wew) every cover is Solid.... the RNG your up againts is not chance to hit but that FU*kin WIDE BULLET SPREAD!!! just pray and spray brother.... just pray and spray.  Pros: -Nice Grapich .can use a little more prop in cutscene ,but heh who cares it's still good. -ANIMATION WEW LOVE IT. the movement of every character is almost near realistic (You better see it yourself in Cutscene ,SO BUY THIS GAME! or... just see it in Youtube) -Nice Story. yeah it's nice.Haven't go till the end but the few first scenario looks promising as the story gets deeper and deeper.) -Easy Control of Characters (EXCEPT FOR TANK!!!) ,but still have his own challege in how to used limited movement efficiently. -Easy Gameplay. You move.... you shoot ,WTF WHERE DID THAT SHOCKTROOPER CAME FROM!!! so even by easy gameplay but still chalengging in where or when do you have to move or put you troops. -Voice acting ,niceeeee. a lot of game is very lazy for this kind of stuff. Knowing that in the game they put so much Voice acting ,really makes me forget about my 20GB Harddisk space. -Grinding without chance of loosing a squad member. F*CK YEAH!!! very rare for Turn Base Strategy game. -Almost realistic battle ,if you lose da Turn Base and make it a MMO 3PS game it will be good!!! (i pray for you modders out there!!!) -Damage. Well i was thinking about putting this into Cons but i decide it will be best to put it here. The damage system is almost like FPS and TPS game (modders!!! i beg you!!!)well NPC crounch in a ditch the damage is halfed ,EVEN IF YOU SHOOT THEM FROM BEHIND!! (this is why i want to put this in Cons) but the damage system (caused by the F*ckin spread pattern, but actually it is pretty nice) make you damage more in head then body... make sense ,because the enemy looks like wearing a 1cm thick armor plate in his body. But still.. i hate the crouching stuff... i mean... 2 Headshot to be killed by Sniper...WTF  Well this is for now ,maybe will put more stuff in this later. after i go trough my boring life and maybe after play CSGO i will find more interesting stuff in this game. if there are some wrong sentences or word ,please forgive me. I am an Indonesian after all *anjing.. and please help me improve it by donat...ehhh by commenting."
I always forget this game does not have auto save
"Played it on PS3....LOVED IT!  Played the PSP version..... LOVED IT! Played the PC version when it came out.... ....sadly that wasn't a legal copy &gt;.&lt;' nevermind that, STILL LOVED IT!   ....but yes, it's finally time to buy it and play it again!   10/10 would kill for more warrior waifus!"
"WW2 if Belgium was really Japan, and the army was young girls."
"Smooth port, maybe even better experience than the PS3 version.  Also the story is not too awful as people say, it's just an  anime  [en.wikipedia.org]  that's all.     Welkin ♥♥♥♥s Alicia in the ♥♥♥.   "

THEY CANT HIT FOR ♥♥♥♥ SNIPERS CAN ONLY MOVE 2.5 FEET THESE KIDS CAN'T EVADE FOR ♥♥♥♥ LANCERS CAN'T HIT A GIANT ♥♥♥♥ING TANK HOMER SIMPSON IS A MASOCHIST  You should get this game anyway though.

- Fun and deep system    before you realize one heroine to wipe'em'all   - Great story    as a Japanese puberty wargame   - Good anime graphics    for a PS3 port but cutscences worse than gameplay because of resolutions   - Fun new game+    if you are interested in hard ex   - Good price    when you buy it on sale cuz it's an old ps3 port  
"Pros: Everything  Cons: Nothing, except that lack of sequel (unless you want to play it on PSP's tiny screen)"
The best game made by a guy who draws nazis having sex with elf-lolis I've ever played
Cool game...but GET YOUR PRICES RIGHT...bought it on 6.79 now its 4.99...I want my money &gt;:I
"Looks Nice, Plays Nice.  But uh, not my kind of game to be honest.  If you like old timey war and anime, then give it a go.  Possibly worth full price."
"More of this type of game is needed, NOW. It's amazing, really. Except for when your point blank with a Lancaar (RPG) and the missile either no clips straight through the target, doing no damage, or veers so sharp to the side it's as if someone jump scared the shooter as they pulled the trigger. You've just got to love an army comprised of nothing but 12-21 year old girls who go on murderous rampages then cheerfully smile and dance, and don't even get me started about the 'accuracy' of 'Snipers'..."
"The only problem is the 30fps frame lock, because it's kind of awkward to look at. It makes the game seem kind of laggy.  That's the only problem."
Sniper #1 Nek minit miss headshot at close range. Wtf
[Enter generic review and recomendation here]
"First the Gameplay this is strategy game Well i expect something more but it's like playing chess -Fun Gameplay -Grinding (You'll replay some Level to Get money and Exp) -Repetitive -Shot enemy,And he dodge..... or your shot missed....  Second the story if you like the anime, you'll like the game  Last the soundtrack Not bad,but it's very repetitive  the game is Worth To buy,Graphic is unique and it's a good port btw"
"great tactical game use sniper, scope on enemy face and beautifully miss rip aim, 10/10 would just yolo"
"For a person who doesn't have the means to play Fire Emblem, this is a good substitute! If you have a bit of interest in strategy games, anime art style, and a solid story, you owe yoursel to get this game!  Only wish it has multiplayer mode  Rating: Vyse/10"
"Get my money !! if you do a sequel.  This is how fasinating game should be big boobs, blue hair and SM!!!!!."
"Fantastic, I hope they release the rest of these"
"ore ga mamoru! lol.  etto, if u like anime, maybe u will love this game.  +this game have a great seiyuu +nice and good graphic +nice environment +good gameplay system (turn based + actions, needed skill tactical player. lol) +nice and good story  15/10 "
"Took me a while to figure this game out, but a lovely artstyle and compelling gameplay are more than worth it."
"This is a PC port done right.  Other developers should take note. There are a lot of games out there with a cult following but never saw the light of day on other systems. Some of them are absolute classics and there is potentially a very big market that will enjoy the experience of a 'HD remake' if the port is done right.  The graphics are beautiful and unique, and not too demanding on a slower system. The gameplay I would say mixes the strategy of Fire Emblem with the third person movement of say Sanctum. The story is gripping and the characters are deep. As well as tactical turn-based combat you can level up your squad, tank and weapons. As the story progresses the characters' relationships with each other develop, but there is a lot of replay value here too as there are a lot of people to choose from who aren't necessarily main characters, but are deep and detailed all the same.  I can't really find a fault with it, but bear in mind that you should save regularly and it also, like many RPGs, requires quite a big investment of your time."
Really good story game.
Kinda like XCOM: Enemy Unknown but good
"amazing port, amazing game, loved it a must have"
"Would highly recommend this game to lovers of both RTS games and Turn based games, its blend of stratergy and unit building is impressive and welcomed."
"World War II but is also the animes. Kawaii, desu ne?"

A great game with a catching story and art!  Best pc port I've seen in a while.  I can't wait for the other Valkyria Games to get ported to pc!
Great use of rich story and amazing playable missions. The cinematic scences are really nice.  Game is really worth the money!! give us the second one !!
The analvice is so hard to control. Lardo is fat. That is all...
10/10 hope for games 2 and 3 to come to pc 
I've barely started and it's freakin' awesome.
"Positive  - Great touching story line - Nice addictive graphics. Now i wan't more games to look like this. Especially that cutscene where Selvaria orders the charge for the imperial army in chapter 7, makes your spine shiver from excitement. - Very detailed character/weapon/area/history information and backgrounds - Many optional squad 7 characters for many different tastes. Do you wan't cute loli, pollen allergic young lady, lazy engineer who's weapon gets stuck more than once or maybe man hater b!tch? Or worst, girl who does not wan't to kill anyone, enemy takes adventage and shoots the b!tch while she shakes her head and tells you no i don't want to kill. Makes you feel that they are really forced in to war, they are just regular people. (Winter War) - Character traits make each soldier feel unique. One gets confidence when his friends are close to him. One chick gets negative bonus because she hates to be near other people. Lots of different personalities which make everyone memorable - Optional Japanese voice overs, thank goodness - One ungrateful fat swine got caught in Valkyria explosion, the YES! moment.  Negative  - Too easy. Impossible to lose (except few missions) and any Squad 7 soldiers. I only lost one and that was on purpose. RIP. Jann Walker - Missions become easily very repetitive  - English voice acting  - English subtitles are 'off'. They give you often false information how story and relation ships progress. Rest is up to you if you manage catch original script from Japanese voice overs.  Horrible  - Final mission. Designer's parents must have dropped the baby atleast twice! - Selvaria died ^^  Final Flight,   'Welking reminisces Isara's dream. Alicia: Welkin... English subs mindblow: Rest in peace!'  WTF?"
"This is by right THE best RPG/turn-based strategy game I have ever played or seen.   The graphics are also truly exceptional. This game was released in 2008, probably about 6 years before its release on Steam and almost 7 until the writing of this review, and the graphics are still stunning. The unique engine the game uses literally makes the scenes in the virtual book to come alive, while they still look like drawings with pencil and watercolours. Even if you normally don't like anime, you should still play this game. It is exceptional.   The plot is also amazing. I don't normally watch anime or play anime-based games, but this one is exception. This is the example of what an amazing story can be told through a video game and of how well it can be told. The characters are really life-sized. Like what you could normally find in a book - and I mean, a really, really good book - here, the characters are also so alive, so real, that you forget that they are imaginary. The characters you meet in the game are very diverse and in many cases simple black-or-white morality would not apply to them. You are a squad leader in militia and all of your squad members are individuals with certain likes, dislikes, medical conditions, phobias and talents. Some of your key squad members are racist or sexist while others can get distracted by their squadmates to chitchat. At the same time, in certain conditions, they are able to perform significantly better due to them being in a very familiar environment or surrounded by close friends.   Many of the enemies are not really just ruthless psychopathic murderers either - many of them were really just made to fight you by their superiors while actually they easily relate to you and on certain occasions when it matters, they will arrange your survival even though it thwarts the goals of their commander.   The gameplay is fun and frequently is also very tactical. You will have to use the advantages the given terrain offers you and exploit weaknesses in the enemy's defence to your advantage. There are several unit classes and as I previously said, each of the units is unique in his/her way.  Really buy this game. You will never regret playing it. I assure you. 10/10"
*Points gun directly to soilders head about 2 cm away from him* *shoots* *the attack misses and i get killed* 10/10 would die again
Xcom+Anime=Valkyira Chronicles   A must buy if you're a fan of both!
And it was at that moment I noticed my war squad was full of lolis and a 80 year old engineer.
"Great amount of detail in storytelling, RPG elements for units/tanks customization, and unique take on turn based combat and view.   The story was moving and the gameplay was engaging. The story book presentation, excellent art style, unit mix and personalization deliver a wholistic turn based gaming experience that rivals most out there. This game has it all from a turn based, story driven and customization aspect. You fall in love with your units and characters, explore their secrets and bonuses. Through to the end you are driven to see them succeed.   The only tragedy is no sequel or follow up to live up to what was delivered here. Furthermore, I wish more games would explore a similar turn based tactical feel and application delivered within this game.   9/10 - only downside was that some missions pushed the difficulty spike to 11."
Good for Strategy game lovers
  Great game but you will need a strong pc just to play it.
+Graphics engnine was artistic and enjoyable.  +Storyline was engaging. +Combat system combined best of both worlds  10/10

Never has World War II looked this cute since Battlefield Heroes.

"So you like anime? Check.  You like World War 2? check.  You like Xcom and Final Fantasy Tactics? Check again.  This is all those things put into one package called Valkyria Chronicles™. The graphics are just like Ni No Kuni's, colourful and vibrant but the older textures do require you to get a few of the available texture mods to improve on them. The controls were designed for a console controller so you will have to get use to the control scheme which isn't all that bad it just feels different. The characters are mostly interesting except for one 'EA style character shoved in your face named Jann' and the voices are all different and some are annoying just like in real life. Overall a great JRPG that does a WW2 setting.   My IGN Style rating 8.5/10 'Little Better than Great'"
"Awesome game, definitely recommend it. The story is wonderful, and the gameplay is just as good. Make sure to play with a controller."
"This game is such a hidden gem! Nearly everything about it is great, the story, gameplay, style, music... It's definitely a great experience, and I would highly recommend it."
Army of the dream war together with several waifu
"Interesting story and fun mechanics for a turn-base. The graphics hark back to a Manga-filled entertainment time with that JRPG twist, however, it loses its chrub demeanor very quickly when you discover that it is extrodinarily repetative in its style of play - as in - you learn early and nothing else changes outside of settings and storyline... Storydriven people will love it, but it burns you out fast if you're searching for more."
"One of the top 5 most enjoyable single-player games I have ever tried. If you wonder if you should buy it, BUY IT"
pretty good for anime
"First game I bought when I got my PS3 in 2009, and still completely worth buying now."
"I came to this game as a Fire Emblem fan looking for the same experience on PC. This game might be that.  I have to say 'might' because I have a few gripes, or rather, there are a few differences that I find troublesome. I want to make it clear that I do think the game is good and encourage you to pay attention all the way to the end to find out why.  1. You really have to like cutscenes. I'm admittedly only 4 or 5 chapters in, but the balance of cutscenes to missions has been absurd. I would assume (and hope) that the gameplay takes a greater role in later chapters, but the start is a little slow.  2. You are immediately forced to chose 20 characters for your squad, and each character starts pre-loaded with up to 3 friendships and I think 4 different traits such as pollen allergies and being chatty. It's a very daunting choice and lacks the slow building of your relationship with each character that Fire Emblem is so good at.  3. Every character of each class ranks up the same. This is a similar gripe to above. It's a very impersonal system that, while lacking in annoying things like levelling up Donnel on hard mode, takes away a little of that player-character relationship.  I said that I liked the game though, and that lies entirely in the actuall tactical combat. Every mission so far has been challenging, offering unique tactical issues that were not in previous missions. I hear I might have to grind some Skirmishes later, in order to level up for the story missions, but if they are designed as well as the story I don't expect that to be a problem at all.  In short, this is a great tactical game, but lacking in some of the RPG elements that Fire Emblem excels at. The gameplay (although sometimes a little slow) will not leave you disappointed and wanting for a challenge, but in-between you might wish you could engage more with your squad. "
:)
I really enjoy the game and am glad it was finally released on PC. I've experienced an FPS drop bug that has to be fixed by tabbing out and back in but no-one else has encountered this so :S I would very much recommend this despite the glitch because of unique gameplay and decent story.
It is good.
"Really good strategy game, but some aspects of the game are a little frustrating, like the ranking system. Overall, would recommend it. Unfortunately, there are ways to breeze through the game with scouts using orders."
"Could this be the best game from the previous console generation? It just might be. Valkyria Chronicles was the game that got me to buy a PS3, and holy christ was it worth it. Possibly the greatest strategy game I've ever played, the combination of turn based combat and 3rd person action makes for one of the most unique gameplay expieriences around. JRPG fans will also enjoy it for its unique take on alternate-history, World War 2.  For $20, this game is a must play for strategy fans and JRPG fans alike. Worth every penny and then some."
"This game is really fun, if you like strategy games. It's kind of like fire emblem/advanced wars, but with a fps twist. I highly recommned this for David!"
"I only knew the amazing soundtrack before, now I know the game is also great ! Thanks for the port, couldn't try it on PS3."
"In my top 5 games of all time. Really a puzzle game, not a strategy game."
Fun turn based alternate WW1 game.
"Sight* after playing Valkyria Chronicles 2 and watching the anime to this game. You really lose all hope to this game. I want Valkyria Chronicles 2 on the PC. Anyone who buy it, it worth the money, the story is fantastic."
"I dont write reviews often, but this game being on Steam is truly awesome. A classic for tactic-strategy-rpg fans. This game broke molds with introducing realtime, 3rd person interaction of your characters on top of the tradtional 'game-board' view found in most tactical rpg's.   Story is present, and it's great - but it definitely knows its place in the whole scheme of things. You dont get bogged into extremely complex, grind-intensive story quests or pointless missions. Its all about the battlefield and forming your squad to take on a crazy variety of challenges and bosses. The setup is great for times you just wanna pick up and play a bit.   Being a fan of the series that later continued on the PSP, I was extremely happy with SEGA for bringing this gem to Steam. Especially after they chose to not bring VC:3 over to the US [thankfully there are workarounds for that ;) ]  I cant recommend it enough. Honestly suprised this game's formula didnt cause more games to come along in similar style. "
This is how you do a port! 60 FPS almost all the time. Beautiful art style and soundtrack. Intense moments that remind me of x-com. This game comes very highly recomened. A must buy if you love Stratey games and JRPS's
Awesome game if you like x-com and want play something familiar you should buy this game -Story 11/10 -Gameplay 10/10
"I've previously played this on the Playstation, back in my pre-PC gaming days...hey, we were all young and foolish once.   Pros: I thoroughly enjoy this game. Great art direction, lots of strategy (turn based with an active combat system), great research &amp; development tools, and a great story. Very interesting take on WW2-esque weaponry (including tanks) combined with supernatural powers for certain characters.  Cons: As with any game, there are occassional inconsistencies with the voice acting. There is some 'nature is important too' undertones throughout that seems a little out of place. I wouldn't have minded if this was just a combat game - but that would have taken away from the excellent story.  The story got me hooked the first time I played this, and has me hooked again. The combat is excellent and demands real strategy at times. The art is absolutely some of the best I've ever seen. The characters are well written and mostly (90%+) well acted.   Military RTS fan? try this game Turn based strategy fan? try this game RPG fan? try this game JRPG fan? try this game Fan of good games generally? try this game"
"Excellent. This is the first and only game I'm making a review for because it's so good. Storyline, gameplay, and it's just really touching."
I really enjoy this game's gameplay.    A must buy if you like RTS/TBS.
one step towards making anime real again
Tactical turn based combat set in an anime-styled 1930s 'Europe'.  -ons:  - SO MUCH IRRELEVANT TEXT! - Graphics are fine. - Story is cliche. - Limited character types. - Gameplay is generally a little slow (unecessary pauses and animations).  +ros:  - Compelling and unique turn based combat. - Various tactical approaches functional. - Maps are large and interesting. - Fun.
"Great game . for genre of Turn-Based , RPG , Shooting 555 + Anime + Cartoon . I want to see some games like this . AWESOME. Nice Sound. Good Graphic for playing .  Nice in 2015 .  "
"Nice story,nice graphics,nice tactical combat."
"Really fun game with pretty good story. The art style and soundtrack really fits the game as well. It's a turn based strategy game mixed with little 3rd person shooting mode. It has some neat game mechanics like different character classes with different character perks/bonuses which activates during certain circumstances in a battle. You can research/upgrade new weapons and tank upgrades too. I liked how each solder has ther own really good voice acting which perfectly matches their character perks. (I played with Japaese audio, idk how eng dub sounds). BTW, the translated subtitles are terrible, it usually does not match what the characters are saying at all. So if you play with Japanese audio like me, you might get a little annoyed."
"man....this game was amazing.This game has a great story,the characters are fleshed out and i feel a connection to them they actually have a personality... so on my first run through i made sure nobody died... heh even the recruits who didnt contribute to cutscenes has a story of their own to tell in the 'personnel' tab. The ending was great and all as i great to see the main couple after the war and how everything started to be alright but as always i can never get any closures from endings  the game shows the gruesome truth of war and shows the good and evil in humanity. im still crying over Is .... wished valkyria 2 and 3 continues the story of squad 7 but alas i cannot get what i want in life"
"I love good anime. You love good Anime. I love good JRPG. You love good JRPG.  Worth every cent, this is one of the most unique and satisfying JRPG's I've ever played. Buy it."
This game is so beautiful. A must buy for all types of players. Depth storyline and great voice acting.
"One of the best strategy game I have ever played. Despite being a first person shooter, this is a turn-base action game that has more in common with table top games like Warhammer 40K. It's not about how good your aim is, but where you place your soldiers.  P.S. To improve the graphics download GeDoSaTo. It's a free software that can downsample the game to improve anti-aliasing."
"Magnificent game. One of my absolute favorites of all time. If you love turn-based/real-time strategy and Anime-esque epic storyline combined with a faux World War II situation, you'll adore this game."
"Valkyria Chronicles and one of the best ARPGs released to date. The battles are well-balanced , innovative and strategic , beyond the emotion of the loss of members which makes them human and important as well.  Final: 9.0/10.0"
"Once you set the audio language to Japanese, you can't handle the weebs inside you.  This is a really great strategy game with visualized SFX.  Rrr Rrr Rrr Rumble Rumble Rrr Rrr Rrr Rrr. Shuffle Shuffle Shuffle. Vroom Vroom Vroom. Ratta Ratta Ratta Ratta Ratta Ratta Ratta Ratta. "
Just when you thought you nailed the match and having fun...... . . . . . . . . Until the Imperials hit your Edelweiss from the back. 
THIS JUST IN  BREAD GIRL FROM BRUHL WINS WARS BY HERSELF   10/10
Tfw you already have Valkyria Chronicles and it gives you a coupon for it.
This game right here... It's just great. It's special in every way! The story may not be the best... BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS SO ♥♥♥♥ING GREAT! Buy it when it is on sale!
&gt;Losing mission. &gt;Everyone dying. &gt;Only Jann remains. &gt;Performs long distance no scope rocket shot to win the mission. &gt;Gay celebration.  10/10 Would play again
"You want to playing TPSRPG sequential person like XCOM but with Anime stuff  I recommend this to you.  All is good with good visualization, story, and gameplay... although controlling the tank is very ridiculous one (Use Num key on keyboard instead using mouse) lol  95/100  Perfect if you're XCOM Player and/or Anime lover :3"
"Like the art style. The gameplay is pretty good, though the controls feels wonky at times."
"One of the best strategy games I played, a little more straightforward than vc2 and vc3 but still very good"
"I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I really dig the art style and the X-com like gameplay. The story was just OK, but it teetered on being 'really good' at points as you dove deeper into the motivations of the small but well written characters. I'm not an anime person, but it wasn't too irritating here."
"Loved this game for PS3, and though the Steam Port does the game justice I'd highly recomend playing with a wired/wireless controller as opposed to a keyboard."
"This game is honestly amazing! The way you fight is unique, and the story is really good. The cutscenes is a work of art itself! This is honestly one of the best games i have even if i have low gametime on it!"
"Geat Style, story, gameplay, and art. I can't say there is much more I could have wanted form this game."
"Im not a fan of anime, however this game made me forget that. If the artstyle is what bothers you, look beyond it. The story is exellent, gameplay fun, althoughnot a realy tactical combat simulation like xcom, like flanking bonus and stuff didnt matter to me, game had me by the throat. Challenging but not ruining the experience. Didnt think I'd like a game like this, but this one one of the bettter surprises i've had."
"I haven't played too many turn based games (this and Civ5), so I cannot make in genre comparisons, but I can say with confidence that this is one of the better written games I have had the chance to play. My only real complaint is the inability to skip the intro. Overall this is an enjoyable game that I highly recomend if you have the 30-50 hours it takes to complete."
Everyone is right - this is a pretty good game. The story is fantastic and quite moving.  The anime style graphics still totally hold up even after all of this time.  The only thing that I have to complain about is that the controls (using a controller) is a bit funny and take a little getting used to. Also I didn't like it when I took too long to decide what to do and got shot a second time.
xcom with waifus
  Waifus... that is all.
"CUTE ANIME GIRLS WITH GUNS AND TANKS  WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? DO IT!  Actually, the game is good and much more deep than that. For some reason, I find the story captivating, the units touching, and I feel bad whenever I ♥♥♥♥ things up and let them take a bad shot. Music is good, art style is good, GAMEPAD controls are good enough, Voice Acting deserves capital letters, and cute winged piglet does not give a single fudge and is incorporated in the milicia with swagg."
Game has no good waifus.  0/10 don't buy this sh  it.
"This is literally an anime version of WW2. It's amazing and a must buy if you love history, anime, or strategy games with amazing combat systems."
"A fun and exciting game. Valkyria Chronicles let's you enter a fun and inspiering world with a unic setting and intresting characters. History fan's are gone have some fun with the setting which is a addaded bonus and fan's of TBS games like X-COM,X-COM 2 and fire emblem are gone have fun with it. 10/10"
"Pros: Innovative, fun, challenging turn-based tactical combat. Great Gameplay.  Cons: Just the worst story. I mean painfully awful. I read about how everyone says the story for this game is great. They, like FOX News, were neither fair and balanced or anywhere near the truth. If you are a 10-year-old who knows nothing about war and thinks Anime tropes are how the world works, maybe you'll like the story. If you suffer from clinical psychosis, maybe you'll like the story. However, if you've seen a movie/game/TV show with decent writing or voice acting in the last 20 years, you will probably hate every cutscene with the hellfire inferno passion I did. Who writes a story about war to be that naive? Seriously?  The writers for this game need to take up burgerflipping for the greater good of the rest of society. But then again I imagine the writers were probably 2nd-grade school girls who believe the world is made of only sunshine and ponies. Burgerflipping might have to wait a few years.  That said, Play this game. Skip EVERY cutscene."
"I really like that this game has a strong storyline, I'm just really bad at it."
an awesome twist on the style of turn based first person shooter. the main character from early onset kept me playing until i finished. plot twists all around keep you wanting to find out more. not only does it this game allow you to play a game but tell the full story in episodes that resemble a kind of anime.   play if you like disgeia series or even FFT:WOTL
"Not really much need to try and express things in spread out detail, because the game is already straightforward with you and puts it in your head of what's going on and what to do, especially when you realize enemies can shoot and kill you during your turn if you don't use strategy. The combat system is very unique and a one of kind, where you can get killed during the turn by realtime attacks, unlike most other turn based games where the enemy doesn't attack until their turn. The story is good and heartfelt, but it's nothing revolutionary.   Everything seemed good when coming from turn based games like Xcom, until you find out something to where alot of people look at and agree as being a major flaw in the ranking/reward system(including me), that eventually might grow on you to the point where you might not want to replay the game. The Ranking/Reward System gives more of a reward to a player, for example, who gets all their troops killed with only 1 soldier left, than someone who actually kills all the enemies and doesn't get any of their soldiers killed or even skilled enough not to take any damage at all, as long as the player with 1 soldier left completed the mission in typically 1-4 turns. I got rewarded more for using 'orders' on Alicia to complete 'Windmill Plaza' in 1 turn with most enemies alive, than killing all the enemies and keeping all my soldiers alive in a 4-7 turns to complete the missions.  The game gives permadeath with a emotional sad scene of the soldier's farewell speech if a enemy happens to get close and touch the body of a knocked out soldier, BUT yet the game basically encourages people to rush in sloppy and reckless for the most part to complete the mission as fast as possible for the 'A rank'. The DLC was a disapointment to me, especially the one about the 'Valkyrie', because it requires alot of unnecenssary effort to unlock EVERYTHING, but there's a more impactful reward to just do half of the battles for the very powerful gun, instead of the full 3 plus the hidden one just to play as the Valkyrie for ONE battle.  BASICALLY, it's mainly worth playing as a turn based fan for it's unique combat turn based mechanics, but the flawed ranking system just messes up the game for heavy replay value, especially since most of what they promote to justify replaying the game with the 'New Game Plus' is it grind through the flawed ranking system to get a 'A rank' on everything, rather than actually getting new story possibilites, like I would've liked, especially since the story doesn't give any extra choices to change things in a major way."
Great strategy game where throwing a grenade to yourself to be blown over an obstacle is the absolutely legitimate strategic approach!
"Great gameplay, Great story, Great Grapics"
"It's not the typical anime-style game. It's a really good RPG, give it a try. Amazing story and easy to learn but difficult to master (try to beat the game in Expert, oh boy...)"
"I am writing this in order to get the badge. However the game is great, do buy it if you like turn-based game. Excellent graphics and plot."
Much time wasted on trying to get a 100% achievement
It's pretty good.
"Great gameplay with a great story as well. Only problem is that the mission grading system is only based on time, so scout spam can get top ranks rather than actual combat."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a hidden gem with a unique combat system that blends third-person shooters, turn-based combat, and jrpg elements. The soundtrack really highlights the tone of the series and really sets the mood for each section of the game. The story mechanic plays out in the form of picture books where each picture takes the player into a cutscene. These story cutscenes are separated by combat stages where the next page/chapter will unlock once the smirkish is completed. Although the story is not as memorable as others, it is interesting and comprehensive enough to engage the player's full attention. If you are a fan of Jrpgs..actually i would advise anyone to give this game a try. 9.8/10-(well no game can be perfect ;-) )"
"Nice gameplay, Good story"
"This is my first review. I apologize if it's not organized neatly. That being said, buy this game. Valkyria Chrnoicles is a wonderful turn based startagy game with a beautiful story and characters that you will fall in love with. At multiple points during this game I found myself crying, and I have no shame in admitting that. If you play this game you will understand. I will stay away from descibing the plot, because you can read that in the description. If I had to list one flaw, it is that this game is more puzzle than stratagy, each level has a set way to beat it in order to get the most points. You may beat the level in one move, but if it is not the way the deisgners inteneded, than you won't get the top grade. That being said, if you are looking for a game that is more than just points, a game that has a fun and easy to understand control system, a wonderful world, intruiging characters, and one of the most beautiful plots of all games, you have found it. Valkyria Chronicles is proof that game development is as much an art as painting or literature."
One of the best Tactical combat games ever made.
"One of the most stunning strategy games out there on the market would have to be this one, Valyria Chronicles. Inspired by the novel itself, the developers sought to create a game out of this remarkable anime. I have seen the anime and truthfuly I think that I may have shed a couple of tears throughout the episodes. I am obsessed with World War II games and this certainly may not be nearly or exactly similar to World War II but it is some what relevent towards it. I would like to thank the developers for forming an amazing game version of the anime and furthermore, I would like to thank the anime novel writers/directors for writing/directing an amazing novel. I hope to see similar works such as these in the near future."
You got waifus in my world war!  You got a tactics game in my weeb ♥♥♥♥! They taste great together! 
The anime version didn't give it justice so I came for the game instead.
"In many ways, Valkyria Chronicles is exactly the game it looks like. It's a goofy anime style game with over the top characters and a ho hum story that was playied out long before the game's release. By all means this game has no reason to stand out, but is different. From the moment you start it up and the opening cutscene begins to draw itself and the gorgeous music begins to play, you're taken away to a wartorn world full of people you'll actually care about. Yes they're still goofy and over the top, but there are so many powerful moments that it's hard to say that one stands above all the rest. It's a tale of friendship, loss, and love, told elequently between hard fought missions with excellent gameplay mechanics and through amazing hand drawn visuals and a legendary soundtrack. Valkyria Chronicles is one of the most underappreciated games you never played, and you should rectify that immeditely."
"If you are a fan of a good story, your a stratagist, and love anime. HIGHLY RECOMENDED! Its worth every penny! I know these comments really do this game no justice but man alive, i'd love to see more games like this!"
"A good port of a great PS3 SRPG. I really dig the storybook look of the game, as well as the mix of shooting and strategy movement. The story gets pretty anime at times, but otherwise it's a pretty good fantasy WWII story."
You can't go wrong with anime tanks. Bonus points for fun gameplay
Definitely a different type of gameplay mechanics...strategy involved and all that...should give it a try for any strategy fans out there.
"A port worth playing, one of those games I'd suggest anyone with a liking to Jrpg and stratege should try out"
"Excellent game. Turn based combat with some FPS elements. Beautiful story, a real hidden gem."
"A timeless classic!!  One of the best PS3 RPGs originally released in 2008, this game still holds well to this day A very excellent and emotional story (Inspired by WW2) it features many real world issues from racism to horrors of war.  Gameplay combines real time and turn based strategy to make this an excellent game  Highly Recommended!! "
"Truly one of my favorite games of the PC. It has a good amount of options, a well made configuration menu, and a smooth frame rate. It's one of the best ports to PC I've seen done in a while. Anyway when it comes to the actual game, the gameplay is amazing and rewarding, the voice acting isn't that bad, and the story is pretty good. At the time of review it's $6.79 on Steam and there isn't much reason to not pick it up if your a fan of strategic gaming."
Nominated as sad game award :'(
10/10 would forget the game to play it again
"Valkyria Chronicles is a beautiful game, in terms of art, playability, soundtrack, and story. It's approach towards tactics in the modern era holds true to this day, and its replay value is high. Actually, I think I'd rathe rlike reinstalling it and laying it, right now."
This game was the only reason I bought a PS3 back in the day.
"One of the best tactial games I have ever played. An interesting mixture of Turn-Based Strategy and Third-Person Shooter. Great story too, that doesn't try to sugarcoat or glorify war, yet doesn't dwell on these negatives too much."
"A good game with well-written story and unique gameplay, the 3D art style is so aesthetic and polished without too much hardware-demanding. The control may annoying sometimes but still enjoyable. 9/10"
"Do not let the slow start throw you off, this game is amazing. It is well worth the time and money to play."
"A re-telling of WWI/II set in a neat tactical game. Does take a bit of play in 'skirmishes' to level troops high enough to get through some scenarios, but the game play is fun and challenging."
"An excellent example of how to make you care about characters and a story.  Looks gorgeous, even though there are occasional frame drops when facing large parts of the map.  Gameplay is solid, even if simple, and puts you in situations similar to that of something like Fire Emblem.  I love this game. Give it a go."
It's a great game.
"This game. where do I even start? Thge story is great. Though the ranking system sucks, the battle system is imo the best battle system out there. The graphics are pretty. If you are into visual novels and tactical games, this is a must buy."
One of the best turn based RPGs as well as console port game I've ever played. Hope they port the sequels.
Anime as hell.
"10/10 scouts with weapon from Susie's challenge can nearly kill anything, including tanks"
"Normally not my kind of game, but this masterpiece is a suprise. I really loved it!"
Awesome port.
"I can honestly say that this is my favorite turn based strategy game I have played. I really like the cool looking hand drawn graphics and OST. The gameplay is fun and varies from level to level, the story tugs on the heart strings, and there is plenty of replayability. I would suggest picking this one up on sale. Over all: 9/10 pretty swanky"
"Most pleasing game I've played in a while. Really enjoyed the experience this game offered. The gameplay (battle system) was especially refreshing to play. The story, graphics, and audio were all timeless. The characters were a bit quirky, but still charming. The missions had a healthy amount of challenge, playing the 'intended' way, which made it satisfying to play."
"This game is SO GOOD, the story is really well written (almost as good as Deus Ex), the gameplay is very enjoyable and the port is not that bad! The only problems of this game are: The tank commands are frustrating and you'll spend so much time with your favourite waifu (Marina FTW!) that you'll not care about the actual protagonists ('cept for Alicia and Welkin ofc). The game becomes even more enjoyable when you try to get all the references to the actual WWII and WWI that there are in the game. I actually cried manly tears in the finale... T_T. Why are you still reading this? Buy the game already! ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it!"
simply breath taking
"Great art, story and music. Gameplay is unique. It really \ depends on your preference  Now I wonder if this game comes out first or the Anime comes out first ..."
"This game is combined with TBS (Turn Base Strategy) , RPG and 3rd Person in JAP anime theme. 23 main story missions, 5 side story missions (9 skirmish missions, 6 challenge mission and 1+2+2 bouns mission for DLC)   PROs + beautiful artwork make the game very nice even it released almost 10 years ago + many thing to do such as finding spacial and secret waepon, squad and armory are upgradable, new game+, Expert mode and bonus content (if u buy DLC)  CONs - a gun from DLC training mode is very cheat, make the game too easy (except for expert mode) - too simple and boring story (espacially, if u don't like JAP anime theme)"
"This game is amazing, please Sega we want Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on PC as well!"
  Really nice game.
"I Love the story, combat, and atmosphere of this game! I highly recommend playing this game and maybe watching the Valkyria Chronicles anime series in the meanwhile."
Recommended. Think XCOM enemy unknown combat in first person. I thought it was a little long and dragged in the last third and the story was cheesy but the combat and tactics are very rewarding. Dont be putt of by the anime the gameplay makes up for it
"I play this with an Xbox controller, which I highly recomend doing.   Overall this game is amazing. At this time I have still not finised it, but the story is very good and the gameplay is great."
"Excellent game, Not only was i satisfied with fun fast paced (usually) strategy, but the story was so engrossing and definitely deserved it's 9/10. Only one level make sthe gameplay suffer in this. Please, if you like strategy, story, guns, adorable piglets. play this game, do yourself a favor!"
"Oh my god this game is so good. I regret not playing it sooner. If youre a fan of any fire emblem game, youre sure to like VaIkyria Chronicles. I really hope that sega gives us the other Valkyria games on PC"
The horror of WW2 told with cute anime characters. It works!
"When in doubt, use all your CP on Alicia. 10/10 Scouts OP"
Take my word as a complete stranger to you whose taste in video games might be completely different than yours: I love this game!
 One of the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stories I've ever seen but the gameplay is amazing.
"Great adventure, fun gameplay, and heartwarming story. Loved it."
this game has more than great gameplay the story is so great it makes you want to cry after chapter 8.
"Valkria Chronicles is an anime style turn based strategy role playing game that makes everyone who plays it ask,' where is Valkyria Chronicles 2?' With a beautiful art style, awesome story, interesting characters, tanks at your control, and the ability to seriously wreck your oppenents, why would not by this game? This has you go on suicide mission of random difficulty (depends on the player). If you know how to play the game, ya gonna get rekt. If you know how to actually play the game, you will do fine. Plus if you needed to break the game, plat the dlc missions. If you complete them, you get game breaking guns to own all of your scrub enemies. One final piece of advise, walkthrough are practilly useless for this game, so rely on your own abilities.  10/10 Would atempt to destroy a huge tank that is at least 10 time bigger and better equipped than my tank again #BewareTheIdesOfChapter7"
420/69
"i haven't gotten very far, but i think its good enough to know what is in the game.  Cons : - weak story  - weak dialogue  - Tanks are hard to steer - had to hide my windows taskbar, because somehow its showing inside the game, while also flickering - the game could use some AA, especially on the cutscenes animation, cos the lines are not smooth...  Pros : - Awesome innovative gameplay, by combining between Turn Based and action - nice animation - great english voice (because usually the english voice over are unbearable)  conclusion : a great game, solely because of the way it combined the turn based and action, even if the story and dialogue are quite weak.  so far, a 7 out of 10.  will update my review, after i play some more."
"Bought this game out of interest like 'ohhhhh god I got a anime game... Why did I do this...' turned out to be a really good game. I mean that it actually is a good game.  Basically plot premise is 'Anime WW2' with some mystical powers intertwined. I would say more and bettter for it but I hate spoilers. The characters are well written and such and it does have plot and some 'plot' as well (does romance count as 'plot' even though?). When it comes to gameplay it deviates from traditional Turn-Based games with a mechanic where when you stop a soldier he has a firing arc where he can fires at enemies that move within that arc. I do have a small problem and that is there is no real flanking mechanic (*flanks soldiers at sandbags* ♥♥♥♥ers must be dead *shoots, not dead, still counts as cover* FUCCCCCCKKKKKKK *dies*)   TL;DR Was scared of maybe having bad gameplay and story was pleasantly surprised by both, good game."
Kawaii girls who do extra damage by being near other kawaii girls?  How bout big gay men with big guns?   Oh and Selvaria and the Ghalian Princess  10/10 would do a kawaii pose after killing 10 people.
PRESTO!!!!!!!!!!! I'M FAT
"  **SPOILERS**   What the heck, a 12 years old girl can be headshot by heavy tank's shell and COME BACK INTO COMBAT 5 MINS LATER but Isara gets killed by just 1 scout bullet"
"At first I saw gameplay from Valkyria Chronicles™ on YT. I love it and I cursed because I did't have PS at that time.  Then I saw an anime - typical example how NOT to do an animation based on a game.  After a few years I read my favorite gamers magazine page after page, like always. Then I flip a page and see that Valkyria Chronicles™ is out on Stream in PC version.  Mind blank, jaw on the floor, eyeballs pop out from pockets. Fast run to PC, Stream launch, money spend.  Next week was one of the best times with a game from a very long time.  9/10 from me"
'An engrossing story with a beautiful art style and unique gameplay. Just be prepared for a challenge.'   Read the full review  [thegamefanatics.com] 
Wonderful game! Great graphics and nice voice acting. Nice story and interesting game mechanics that blends storytelling and game in one.
This game is very fun uff. Thank Mr Sega.
"Valkyria Chronicles is a great game !! Beautiful Graphic, Good story telling, full of drama, justice, friendship, love and more.  Pros : + Good graphic + Great gameplay + Free DLC + Nice story  Cons : - Quite easy if you already understand the game - Story a bit non sense, how can that small country defeat the greatest one (LoL) - Can't skip enemy turn its a very long battle  Overall 8.5/10"
&gt; Buys the game &gt; Downloaded and installed &gt; Played for a few minutes &gt; Ends up watching the anime itself &gt; Tries playing the game for the missing scenes that wasn't shown on the anime &gt; Gives up  10/10 would spend money on this.
"Turn based fps.  The game has a look and feel of a an Anime, the cut scenes do get anoyning and i do not like the voice acting as it sounds dry and somewhat boring.  To me the whole feel of the game feels outdated and i cant help but think it is a throw back to older games like breath of fire dragon quater with its whole style, feel and voice acting.  Loot feels very rare and upgrades to current weapons are level locked. i found myslef getting fustraited at the lack of impact the end of mission rewards gave you.  However they are aspects of this game i loved, each member of your squal have people they like and dislike which all affects their perfomance in battle, people gain posative and negative traits which means some are better suited to some missions more than others.  although the story acting feels dry the storty itself is brillent and aspects of descrimation for people of some races and a mystery to solve while defending your home land.  the game story is pretty much a copy of the second world war and you feel you are at war with the germans.   you get a lot of hours of game play for your money and if you can put up with the poor voice acting i would recommend this game. The game play is solid and enjoyable. Any fans of Anime should enjoy this game"
The game strategy is good and unique but be aware the game dialog is like for 13 years old audience. If you're an adult you might can't stand the story and prefer to skip it. LOL.
"Valkyria Chronicles' PC port is super solid! Mouse+kb handles beautifully and I haven't seen a glitch or crash yet (currently on chapter 6). Not as many graphics options as I'd like (something to smooth out the jaggies would be nice), but no big deal. Definitely worth getting!  In case other reviews haven't covered it, VC is a phenomenal new style of strategy RPG, Fire Emblem with realtime individual unit control once you select who to use, which couples beautifully with its tactical command mode. Story, writing, voiceacting and visual style are all lovely too, but what really sets it apart is the unique take on strategy RPG combat.  Note: there are A LOT of cutscenes/story/dialogue between each battle. This is a JRPG guys, it's gonna have lots of chat! Most cutscenes are skippable if you want to be clueless as to what's going on, but otherwise expect 5+ minutes of cutscenes for every battle you're gonna play."
"Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best unpopular games i have ever played. Its a diamond in the rough; it has a very unique take on strategy. I love how Sega uses watercolor and anime to artistically portray the game. There are no negatives to the game, and I rate the game 9.5/10 and you should definitely pick it up."
If you're a fan of turn based games this is the game for you or if you just like anime styled games 10000/10 would recommend.
"Its a fun game about teens killing Badolf Schmidtler, ruler of Bermany. It's a great game but not my type. If you want an anime WW2 XCOM. This is the game for you."
Its a very good game you will not regret buying this game.
"I encourage you to try this game as its approach to 3D strategy is really unlike anything I've ever played and makes it unique and endlessly amazing to enjoy. The leveling and progression system is well done and avoids grinding in favor of actually playing the game. The tactics that you can employ are very varied and gives credence to people who can cleverly think their way out of or through enemy traps and strongholds.  The game contains an extremely charming story about war and love and makes you respect all the characters that make up your squad. The developers did a fine job making every character unique, recognizable, and lovable. There are even Skies of Arcadia character cameos!  This game is a true testament to making a game with love and soul. It has so much personality and the game is fine tuned so that you never feel like a challenge can't be overcome. There are definitely flaws to the game (such as being unable to skip the 10-second mission briefing on retries), but they're overshadowed so heavily by the good parts it's hard to even recall them.  So give this game a chance and let SEGA know that this style of game is loved even today; games where intelligence matters, where characters aren't one-dimensional line spitters, where high-end graphics doesn't necessarily mean absolute realism."

"This game is highly addictive and one of my person favourites. If you're interested in RTS I would recommend it, but your mileage may vary."
I played this game on some pc and i didnt know the name. Thanks to steam i was able to find this game
"very recommended  -This game have a good story (happy,sad etc) ,   -have many feature like upgrade weapon ,recruit many character ,job rank up , upgrade tank ,you can take enemy weapon ,  -all character have unique personality and diferent dub voice/ voice acting .  -the story very sad when Isara died ,she a good girl &amp; have pure heart"
"this is a really good game, and some of the feel of it takes me back to the dreamcast. very nice visual style and good story telling. The turn-based tactical play in full 3d is also very cool. the battles are sort of turn-based third-person shooter/tank combat style and it works very well for the game. the perfectionist within you can do the skirmishes to get a better grade and unlock weapons for your mains of each class. you also build xp you can place into those classes (boosting all characters with that class) and money to upgrade the tanks and general equipment of each class. it is not tedious to build them up, since all unlocks and purchases are universally applied to each character within the class. though each character has individual traits in unique combinations that work for and against them depending on the combat conditions... which can reward you for being careful with your selections especially in the skirmish challenges. it's currently on sale, and is a steal at the price."
"pretty good, but chapter 7 is bad"
The game accurately advertises what you are getting and is a true   Turn Based Third Person (Luck Based) Shooter   in the only way it can reasonably be done.   What do I mean?
Pro: +Nice turn-based strategy gameplay +Beautiful animation +A lot of unique characters +Good story  Cons: -No auto-saving features
"I'll be the first to admit I'm not a fan of anime. I never really got in to it, but I played this game with an open mind. And my, oh my, did it change my perception. The story is actually quite good and touching (you get attached to your squad), and thankfully can also be skipped (increase in replay value). The game follows a turn based action point style combat, ala games like Fallout Tactics and X-Com. You can upgrade your squad through xp and their gear through money.  I don't like to give games scores, but it's worth playing, even if you're like me and not an anime fan. Give it a go, you won't regret it."
This game is a must for anime fans. The game is story rich and contains a deep but easy to pick up strategy system.
"I'm not really sure what to write, since I don't generally write reviews, but do make exception for things i find above and beyond. That being said, then of course, I find this game above and beyond. First, I had originally played it on the ps3, so I knew what I was getting into to a degree, though I never completed it on the ps3. So first for technical issues, let me say as far as a port goes, I couldn't even tell it was one.  The game itself is almost like its trying to reference world war 2. It has emotional pull if you like that. It has a beautiful story. You can to a degree customize your characters. About the characters, there is a set list (a decently large list) and so many for each type of unit. each of these characters have 'potentials' that change what they are good at somewhat, and specific people on that list they like, that can change the way you play a lot. Now there sadly a few from each that are obviously just much better, as well as some of the characters dont really have much personality (one i thing was specifically designed not to though). For the list of people they like, it will make them assist in combat without it being their turn.  the battle is interesting, you start out as if you are looking at a map, and you can see your units, your base(s), and generally the enemy base(s). You also see any enemies in line of sight of your units. These are all displayed on the map. on your turn you can (generally) issue orders that are like buffs, or select one of your units to take control of. When you do this, it zooms in on your unit, and you start playing in a sorta neat mostly turn based style. You move your unit around a (I think) beautiful hand drawn scenery (well, besides the desert, thats just desert lol). You find the spot you want to place your unit, generally in some form of cover (at least at the beginning, just a nice tip, shocktroopers can pretty much headbutt the front lines when done right, ROSIE DONT NEED NO COVER, lol, for reals though, gotta do it right). and then if an enemy is in line of sight, you can press to aim, and then line up your target and shoot. After you shoot, it goes back to allowing you to move if you have any more AP to do so. During the time you aren't firing however, any enemy that can see you and is close enough, gets to auto fire at you (works with your units against enemies too though), and they only stop nicely when you are trying to aim.  The story is about mainly about welkin gunther, and how with his nature boy knowledge, manages to gain the trust of his allies, and lead them through some pretty neat victories. The game really focuses on trust and friendship in a way with that. This happens after a small village is attacked by another nation, (if I recall the beginning story says its over their fuel sorce, which weklin's nation has a huge supply). They then pretty much get listed into the militia, as welkin's nation has this thing where everyone has military training through their school years."
"This is probly one of my favorit games of all time, and not mainly b/c of the game play, or the main protaganists. I fell in love with the lone wolf Marina, the guy from a diffrent game Vyse, poor 'inecent' Homer, tom boy Jane, the sweet heart Susie, and star bound Alex, all characters that didnt say a single line in the entire game... i honest to god dont care about the mane characters, but my heart skips a beat when ever Vyse goes down. So if you think you could get atached to a character that has 5 max lines of diologe, this is the game for you &lt;3"
Very nice tactical RPG
"WOW!  If that doesn't sum it up for you, let me explain. I am a fan of Japanesee film and anination, but have never explored Manga, so I was not sure how I would like the art style of this game. In reality, it was so refreshing from the usually modern day, has-to-look-photo-real cliche of the day.  The story is interesting and the art style and animation are perfectly awesome!  I LOVE and have been playing FPS since inception, so I thought I would not like the slower paced strategy, but this game is immersive.  I know it is an older game, but most people who like FPS, great art style and even a little strategy should NOT pass this up!"
"Haven't finished the game yet (played for 10 stright hours to chapter 8 and I have to go to bed now) I'll add details to this review when I beat the game, I just want to recommend this game as quick as possible.  Stories, Graphics, Music, SoundFX, Gameplay... you name it, the game got them all covered - world-class quality.   Recommended 10 / 10 , SEGA really knows how to make great games. By the way, this is one of those games have better English voice acting over Japenese version."
"This game is the PERFECT blend of stratagy turn based and TPS. its got an interesting story, and good art! I don't like all the characters you can choose for your squad, but you get to choose who you want so it doesnt matter as much. I haven't finished the game yet, but i am enjoying every minute of it (even the SUPER hard parts!)"
"I can not count the hours I have into this game and it's sequel between PSP and PS3, this was a joy to see when listed. Finally the ability to use a mouse and keyboard, full 1080p on my pc for a game I adore. Read other reviews if you wish to know the story etc, I just want to say this game if a SRPG fan and lover of great SRPG's is a must own, even among console gamers this is a true classic RPG.  rating: 12/10 heck Infinity out of 10 they did such justice to this game on PC."
"Just bought this. Got a 75% off code, and thought 'why not?'. It's an odd mix of RTS and third-person shooter, and the two really mix well. The story (so far) is rich, and the music really sets the tone. Long story short, this game is really, really good, and I wholeheartedly recommend this."
Loved everything about it. Makes you care for every single character in your squad
"I hate jRPG's. Final Fantasy II was one of the first games I ever played as a child and the format very quickly grew tiresome. When Final Fantasy: Tactics came out it got me hooked again since I was in love with XCOM and the like. Once CD-ROM discs came out and it was possible to have voice actors in games, reading a novel in between every battle became pretty annoying; I played Final Fantasy 7 for about 15 minutes before quitting and I played 8 a bit longer. I haven't played a jRPG since.  UNTIL NOW! Valkyria Chronicles is... I mean it's decent. There's more strategy involved in the battles which is what I enjoyed with Final Fantasy: Tactics. Everything is presented in book format (hence Chronicles, I imagine) so there's no map to explore or anything like that but it still presents you with a lot of lore and backstory via the book you 'read' as you play.  It's all superficial though. It may feel like you're playing a strategy game, but you're still just playing a turn based jRPG that lets you walk your characters around as if you were playing a 3rd person shooter. There's a lot of 'woe is me' Anime BS going on in between missions and some veiled pedophilia but if you can get over 12 year old girl soldiers wearing cat ears, it can be enjoyable in small doses.  Recommended for weeaboos."
Had this game on my wishlist on a whim for a long while.  Got it on sale because I happened to have some spare money.  Went on a feels rollercoaster.  Would have totally bought it at full price if I'd known.
"I played this on my brother's PS3 a while ago. It is just as fun as I remember, and the game loads faster than it did on the PS3. It's a good purchase and a great example of a genre that needs more love."
"Good game, more story focused than gameplay but has most of the right gameplay elements to be fun."
""
"Great game, it reminds me of Hogs of War but with an anime twist. Highly recommended for all strategy game lovers."
"Great game, different, nice blend of shooter, rpg, and strategy elements, only complaint is, the sequels are on ♥♥♥♥ing psp.(headshot) &gt;X.x - - - '---v--q---l"
"I first found this game as a demo for the PlayStation but and really liked it, but never got around actually buying it. Way later I found it on Steam on sale and immediatly bought it. And it was even better than expected."
Ummm yes worth the buy  I actually bought this on pc and found it at gamestop for my playstation
"All u need to know about this game: +Second world war theme +Great character development +Good graphics +Story made me cry cause its to good +Very smart combat system +You get to chose the right characters to deploy depending on the maps surrounding and nature +Your tank is awesome  -tank controls is a bit weird at hard to use in the begining but you get the hang of it =)  Also my tip when you buy this game is to have time to play it, every battle takes at least 30-40 min (after u get your hole squad)  Other than that its a great game and if you haven´t played it you should do it right now."
"So this game is really good.  I have a few complaints, but most of those were answered in the sequels (from what I can tell). There are a lot of little hang ups and problems with shoving turn based strategy and third person action shooter together, but honestly the combination is more interesting than it is flawed.  What this game does accomplish is a cool setting with a cool aesthetic, seriously the art is super well done. Unlike a lot of tactics games, this one keeps the game fun while still dealing with the reality of warfare, that is to say there isn't an Advanced Wars 1 and 2 style 'lawl fighting is great' after losing literally hundreds of troops and combat machines. Unlike a lot of WW2 games, there are a lot of little touches on the not so great side of war, like that civilians often get caught up in the conflict with nowhere to go when they're between two armies other than hoping that joining one of them will give them some control over their lives (or deaths), that the worst in people can show up (like prejudice against certain people) and that not everyone in the military gets preferential treatment like a lot of the 'heroes' in games usually set in this era (as you're technically a militia rather than a regular army even though you fight just as hard and are given missions that even the regular army doesn't want to do).  The absolute coolest thing about this game though is that every trooper has a personality. You get this in both the fact that each has individualized voice acting (which is ♥♥♥♥ing cool enough, like wow) and that each soldier has individual ways in which they both have traits and represent them in combat. Some of them have a pretty decent effect on how that combat goes too: If your engineer prefers the company of women you'd better shove her in with your women troopers so that she fights harder, if your trooper is prejudiced against darcsens you might want to pair them up with non-darcsen troopers so that they fight better overall. Soldiers will have people they like and pairing those people together will mean they'll probably fight a lot better and work to protect their friends. Soon your fighting unit starts to work in certain ways because of your troops preferences, even if on paper a lot of them are largely the same. You can totally replace them if they actually die in battle too: you level up troopers by class instead of on an individual basis, so if you level shocktroopers to level 4, all your shocktroopers, the ones in your squad now and ones you might add in the future, are level 4. That said, there have been more than a few missions I've delayed to med-evac troops even though it would honestly save time to just let them die, because a. I know how they work as individuals and b. this game honestly makes it easy to get attached to them.  That last part, right there, alone, makes this a good game. The rest of it paired with it is just icing on the cake. Really, this game is phenomenal and I hope we get to see the sequels on steam soon."
"Very good for people who enjoy turn-based strategies combined with visual novels! The voice acting, animated movies, music and gameplay are superb all around. This game is very highly polished.  That being said, the DLC is only for those who have no intention of having fun and only want to blast through the game as quickly as possible. If you want to have fun, please finish the main story before the DLC."
Great Story Great Art and super fun gameplay if you love rpgs and strategy based games then Valkyria Chronicles is the game for you 10 out of 10 in my book a Sega Classic
"This is a tactical rpg that's as different as it is gorgeous. As you make each move player control goes from a detached, hand drawn map of the battle to a boots on the ground view of the skirmish as you directly command your individual squadmates. And individual they are, each unit has a unique design, voice and backstory. You'll quickly find favorites and teams that work well together in specific situations."
Interesting twist on turn based combat and RPG elements.  Keep meaning to go back and finish the campaign...
"I kind of want to buy it again because getting it for 5€ feels like stealing, it's worth so much more... Highly recommended"
Excellent port of an already amazing game.
"Amazing story, and good turn based rpg. I love it!"
"I played this a long time ago on my PS. And as far as the story goes, i just started playing it again and i burst into tears after about 4 minutes.  Not having played this game is missing out on something amazing. I cannot as of yet tell you if the port to PC is well excecuted, but it looks decent."
lots of CG with good story.
Great story.  Great gameplay. Great character. Great battles. Great ending. Great effect with the feels. Greatest romance between characters of all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i rate this a 11/10
"Excellent strategy game, decent story. The art style is interesting for the most part. Weapon upgrade system could have been better and is nothing but an annoyance if you do the extra skirmish battles. The levelling up system is adequate, I'd certainly rather have it then not. I hope they bring more games from this series to PC."
Feels like an interactive anime. So far its been very fun and I'm glad I got it.
This game is awesome. Too bad the sequels are not as good.
"World War Waifu Review:  Considering it's a port from the playstation 3, it's alright. Possibly the best port i've ever played, but considering the cons of this game, that ain't saying much.  The game is unstable, my system isn't ♥♥♥♥, the game is unstable. It crashes when I plug in my phone via usb to charge it. It crashes if I tab out. The models don't accurately represent the world, frequently i've been shooting an enemy I can see but don't hit him because the game thinks I'm shooting my tank instead of that dude's head. Gameplay is repetitive and the animation in cutscenes made me question how console players didn't kill themselves. Everyone's hands are too big. Although I'm a fan of the watercolour style, it wasn't rendered for a PC, the antialiasing didn't appear to be there. The system for oders was rarely used by myself.  With the bitcing out of the way: I loved the game when I first played it (after it crashing after 2 hours of unsaved gameplay) It combined two things I love, World War Two aesthetics and anime booty. The story was predictable but that was okay since the characters were well fleshed out enough that you liked the main cast. Combat is fairly balanced and the command point dynamic is interesting. Unit classes have their roles and you can't really go without most of them.  Overall, it's a good 8/10 for a combat game. Try to get emmersed and you'll love it even more."
"Started playing... now I cannot stop.  This game is a few different things rolled into one. RPG and Turn Based Strategy. The story is interesting enough and after every few segments you watch, you participate in a campaign, where the turn based gameplay comes in. Valkyria Chronicles is a lot like the new X-COM, with one exception... I think it is a ton better! The story has more depth and there is more backstory.  The one thing which would make this game way better than what it is, is if the maps and unit placement was random. Unfortunately, once you learn a map, the unit placement, and their routes, it pretty much becomes easy to conquer the map. This does take time, however, and you may find yoruself playing the same map a few times before learning the trick. I think it took me 5 or 6 times trying to defeat the Super Tank.  All that said, I feel the replayability will be decent enough, between the skirmish maps which you can play trying your hand with different units and strategy. As the game progresses you may also work towards upgrades for your tank and units. Just about 24 hours of gameplay in and I feel as if I am not even half way through the game.  This title, I feel, is one of those gems out there. Engaging and fun. The game plays very well and I have not encountered a crash or glitch yet. If you like Turn Based unit tactic games... with exception of X-COM 2, I do not believe I have played any other as good as Valkyria Chronicles."
if you dont mind the childish characters and dialogue there is a neat strategy game tucked inbetween the mediocre story
"Launches Rocket,  Miss Chance 100% Hit Chance 0%  Sniper, Hit Air 100% Death rate 0%  Apparently This game has a better Sniper that Rocket Launcher Quality, Human wont die by exploding, They Die by Getting pierced.   10/10 would like to explode humans again"
"Works fine on my 2008 XP computer. It is a rather easy game if you are not trying to get an A rank for each mission, but you might want to grind on the skirmishes to make up for the lost experience pts and money. If you are trying to get an A rank you will be doing a lot of saving and loading to get that one shot one kill needed to complete those missions. The AI isn't particular good, you worry more about the time restiction then what the enemy is doing. Definately a lot of cut scenes. A definate plus that they left the original japanese audio in. I didn't really get attached to each character, but each have their own individual quirks. Got it on sale for $5 and I think it was worth it."
"Valkyria Cronicles is a JRPG/RTS/TBS it fuses elements of a role playing game, real time strategy game and a turn based strategy game with a unique story and even more unique art style.  This game never got the recognition it deserved outside of Japan when it was first released for the PS3. This game is for people who want a great story backed by solid gameplay and beautiful artwork.  Pros: - Amazing story - Great Art - Believable charecter development - Great Music - DID I MENTION THE GORGEOUS ART DESIGN?  Cons: - To get best rating for a level how well you do is almost non factor, its more about how fast you complete it. - Can require a bit of grinding if you want to get your troops to the higher levels - Controls when playing with a keyboard and mouse feel alittle off - Not sure if this is true for everyone but during cutscences i would have audio issues and the occasional freeze  Conclusion: These are just tidbits and my opinions about the game i didn't delve into it's story or gameplay at all because i will not do it justice. What i will say is that if you want to play a game with great story that will make you have feels then play this game."
just yes to all things this game represents
"10 hours of gameplay so far and i can say i love it. i also love that it can be in japanse, i doubt i could have held my attention to it if it werent able to be in japanese."
"Well, its certainly not a game for everyone... Its a turn based strategy game with r&amp;d and crew Management. Every of your soldiers can be equipped with upgraded or looted weapons and each soldier has their likes and dislikes about teammates, as well as some 'Potentials' (skills) that get randomly or environmentally triggered. All that in a Fantasy/Anime Setting of an industrial and yet medieval age europe with Valkyries and special powers. The Story has Japanese written all over it and you will maybe often get that *facepalm* expression;P Nontheless, this game delivers good and fun gameplay with more than 70hrs!! Im not yet through Z omg-_-  Performance and gameplay is solid and looks a whole lot better than any telltale adventure so far (maybe not a fair comparation but for some reason the feel is similar). AI is quite mercyless and wont forgive big mistakes, but sometimes fails by sending reinforcements right into their own mortar fire. Challenging and Entertaining xD  Only very few missions are short. Some will take hours to complete, even though no fight lasts longer than 20 turns...  I do highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Turn based strategy and who can live with the comicbook graphics. Compared to playtime delivered by other games, this has massive. The Story proceeds nicely with a few unexpected turns. It will happen more than once that you find yourself thinking, 'This is it! The final Battle!', but you are wrong xD  note: I play the game with Japanese Audio and English subtitles. Best Choice for Anime FANS."
This game is one of the best games i have played in a long time its story is amazing it is a long game if you dont rush it and is quite fun
"This game probably has something for everyone. It's tactical, strategic and rewards finishing missions in your own preferred way. I never cared about the grading system, but made sure that almost everyone would come home. If completing a mission had to be delayed in order to save a soldier, then so be it, we're family! This game surprised me with fun characters, straight to the point story and clean gameplay.  This game not only has repaly value, but it also has tons of extra content I have yet to complete. There's no surprise why this game has been remade so many times and on so many different systems. 5/5!"
"Very good RTS game, has crew managment - I felt like Big Boss 10/10"
"a mix of strategy, third person shooter, and RPG, make this one a solid game with it's own unique gameplay. and don't forget about the artwork style, sound effect, and soundtrack that are top notch  anyway, VC3 on PSP have a better story tho, go check it out."
"I am stunned by how well put together this game is. After reading reviews, I still had my concerns - so I waited for the game to go on sale before purchasing. The storyline is solid and blends together some very important messages about humanity into a fictional WW2 esq setting.  My only complaints are when it comes to how almost silly the dialogue is. The story sequences can be far too light when you consider the over reaching storyline. I also wish a bit more was done to incorporate additional memebers of your team rather than just the higher ranking members. They almost become a simple after thought when their roles are just as important.  The game is amazing but could have been even better with small changes. Hopefully, Sega decides to release the sequels to this game on PC as well in the near future after the remastered version is released in May. Either way this game is artful and I'm not even half way finished.  Score: 7.8/10 "
"This game is a MUST play. It may be a bit glitchy, where some are annoying and some are funny, but you will enjoy it, if you like turn based strategy games and a WWII-like game. Story is very compelling. If you have not seen the anime for this, I highly recommend the anime to watch as well. It makes more sense as a story in the anime, but this is more centered around the combat, with a significant amount of story-telling. The characters develop well enough, but it seems a bit empty, and when I finished it, I was REALLY craving more, but sadly, they do not have the sequels on here. A very solid game to get.  Overall: 8.5/10"
"VERY fun game, intersting story, and an entertaining cast of characters. Highly recomend buying."
  Definitely one of the best games i've ever played. Everyone should give this game a try so it would get the recognition it deserves.rating 9/10
  10/10 Nice game)))))))
Good: Great story. Great soundtrack. Use of strategic movements due to limited actions (CP).  Meh: Mediocre voice acting (english). Skirmmishes. Nice cartoonish graphics.  Bad: Very linear. Very simple level up system. No side missions.
"Excellent port of an underappreciated RTS/RPG. Great story, great gameplay, challenging extra missions, and an amazing soundtrack. Support Sega and more games like this so that we may get other Valkyria games and JRPGs."
"I just finished this game and there is one word for it MASTERPIECE this is definetly one of the best anime games out on the market, the story is great, lots of character development, animation style is fantastic and all in all such a good game and if you want such a good feels ending watch the credits until the end belive me you will want to see it 8.5/10 "
"A good game, wish it had a sequal."
Love this game. The DLC challenges are frustrating but fun. Definitely a good strat game. been trying to find something similar on Steam lol.
"  Didn't realised I write so long here :V    Saw this game last year on steamgifts and felt interested but instead of winning it (no luck), bought it on January sales :v   Played the first few chapter, wow really interesting gameplay and artstyle, so decided to slowly enjoy and explore it :v   After Chapter 4 reached to the Capital and unlock the SQUAD and wow such fantastic interesting fabulous characters I can recruit, weapons/armors and tank upgrades :v I slowly addicted to this game and I know it *continue play then* :3  Keep saving on ONE save file until Chapter 15, then I decided to hunt  THE ULTIMATE LONG RANGE OP MACHINEGUN , the 'Ruhm' in the DLC then I OVERWRITE the only savefiles (yes you can save multiple saves) and I don't know what I had done :v ohshit  After many tried on beating the DLC, and hooray ' THE ULTIMATE LONG RANGE OP MACHINEGUN  - Ruhm' finally in my barracks \ :v / then I want to go back my ch15 savefiles then hell yeah you know it, ♥♥♥♥ed up game progress achieved  No choice and I start again with this crazy weapon, oh and start farming exp and kar 8 another OP rifle from another DLC challenge :v lvling all classes level unlock all character potential :v then start defeat all chapters with Rank A speed plus Slaugthering the Empire soldier and bosses non-stop :v ~ hell yea    AND yes.. finally beat the game qwq      Review:"
Loved the Story untill I ran into a pig with wings Other than that gameplay is awesome
Absolutley love this game so far! Great art style with very clever combat mechanic.
""
"If you like Fire Emblem, you'll love this game. This game is alot like fire emblem in the way it plays: Turn based, deep story and in depth character development."
"Excellent game, and the load times on PC are much more acceptable than the original PS3 version. I wish I knew how to upgrade, however. I would love to migrate the downloaded edition I purchased six weeks ago to the graphically updated version that was released later. It deserves the better frame rate and resolution, the art style is one of the game\'s strong points. But that doesn\'t detract from the overall excellence of the game."
"Entertaining tactics based RPG set in not!Europe about not!WW2. Nice art style and music, decent story, decent PC port. Interesting gameplay, but the tactical part fails to shine in some missions where you can just rush a single scout to the end objective to win. Hopefully the sequels get ported to PC as well."
"Hmm, after a recent update to AVG antivirus this game is having a conflict issue with it and you need to (temporaily) disable AVG to get it to run.  However now that I can get the game to work again I'm currently playing through it atm and so far it's a tentative thumbs up from me.   Full review when finished ;)"
"This is just a good honest strategy game with a fantastic story. Controls can be cluncky at times but overall the port works well enough, beware autosave is NOT on."
"The game plays quite well since engine and mechanics are sound and fluid, especially once you figure out the parameters of damage, cover, death and similar things. Also, the turn-based strategy is solid, and will punish you for stupidity.  The storyline is isn't afraid to be a story, and touches on many realistic aspects of both war and the people partaking in it.  In short, I found the key to enjoying this game was definitely focusing on playing with cute and/or terrifyingly badass bishoujo characters.  I'll play the storyline through again once I clean up my anime list..."
"Follow the story of the Lucky 7s as this militia squad struggles in the middle of a war between two great powers. Essentially a WW1 / WW2 setting - no aeroplanes but the pigs do have wings (seriously..).  The art is gorgeous and there's a lot of squad management / backstory to read into if you're into that sort of thing. Gameplay is a mix of top-down turn based strategy, 3rd person cover-based shooter and RPG. Including all the DLC is a great bonus. Totally recommended, I double-dipped on this after having finished it on PS3. Beautiful in 1080P."
"This is a beautifully made rpg game. For starters, fans of the Advance Wars and Fire Emblem series will enjoy this fresh take on unit based combat and unique characters/traits. You really feel the individuality of each of the characters, and you'll soon find yourself taking favorites among the members of Squad 7. (I like Juno, Aika, Catherine, and Nadine, so far)  The anime-style characters and unique, storybook-like motif the game has adds to its charm and is less a hassle and more of a fun experience. Despite the story's semi-mediocre plot, the characters themselves make the gameplay engaging, and I personally enjoyed even the small interactions between units next to each other, like Vyse and Aika when they support each other. (For those of you wondering, it IS those two from Skies of Arcadia).  Overall, this game is a gem that I personally feel all gamers should try at least once. It ties together turned based and real-time strategy gameplay elements with an amazing cast of unique characters to make each battle or skirmish feel like a completely different experience from the next person.  9999/10 Would hang out with Darcsens again"
"Absolutely fun game! I held off trying this game because of its graphics but I was wrong, the graphics are perfect for this game. There were some things I absolutely loved  1: Snipers.. If you put a good sniper with a good gun in a good spot, and have an engineer to keep feeding him/her ammo, and if you have the action points, you can literally wipe out all the enemy troopers (scouts, snipers, lancers, shocktroopers, etc) in view in one or two turns. From very very far away!  2: I love how you can spend all of your action points on one person if you want, but the fatigue adds up and they can run less and less per point spent (they can still do actions though) 3: When you take over a character to move him/her, it goes into first person view. You feel way more vulnerable like that! Especially since troops that see you and are in a certain range can shoot at you.  Its just a wonderful game. It has its flaws but they are minor and well outweighed by the excellent content!"
"9/10 This was all around a fun game that I'd highly recommend. I'm a big fan of the Fire Emblem series because I guess I enjoy games where you struggle to avoid the permadeath of your characters with likeable personalities, so I was naturally very pleased to find Valkyria Chronicles. (However, in this game it's easier to keep people alive because you have 3 turns to reach your wounded soldier and call a medic.)  Anyway, the anime story line was actually pretty interesting despite the cheesy, cliche anime romance. The story kept me coming back for more even until the finale. (I thought the ending after the credits was particularly charming.) I thought the artwork was beautiful and the music, mostly, was excellent. The voice acting was very believable, too.   As far as the challenge level, I thought the game was very challenging and a bit stressful at times (here's looking at you, desert level 7.) However, eventually you figure out the strategies for each level and they're all doable (well, maybe not level 7.)  I played using a keyboard and had no problem navigating my foot soldiers across the battlefield. The tanks, however, seem rather tricky to figure out at first, especially if you're trying to turn it around.  I got about 40 hours of gaming in by the time I beat it, but I'm a bit of a completionist and perfectionist when it comes to levels that you get ranked on.   Give this game a shot. It's fantastic."
"I do not normally write reviews for games but this has to be said about VC.  If you love turned based 3rd person shooters with a rich story this is your game!.  It was like playing my part in a film the story was great, it has a comic like look but great mechanics.  Leveling up your troops, choosing weapons and unlocking orders it was just a treat to play."
Very unique and fun game!   Nice mix between strategy and FPS and the story is okay.
"just like everyone said, its like fire emblem, with guns. I like playing it because it reminds me of playing tabletop games. just be extra careful with your soldiers, always put them behind cover.  Cons: - voice acting of some characters can be VERY cringeworthy. i turned the VoiceOver off. - Wish there was more customization options for characters.  but its really worth your money, i can guarantee."
"Ive played this game on the ps3, and I absolutley loved it! now that its on PC i thought it would be even better, except it doesnt run over 30FPS for me... Good game but how do i fix this?"
My Favourite game. This is an amazing series and this first game is by far the best. Play it.
"An awesome blend of turn-based strategy with real time 3rd person controls, a very unique style of gameplay that I thoroughly enjoyed. The story was great and the characters develop well enough for you to give a damn about whats going on."
"The Empire is Russian, and The Federation is Alied Powers??? Gallia is Poland!?! GG We have Poland war @@ But they miss Germany right? cant Hail Hitler Zzz :)))"
"Valkyria Chronicles is one of my all time favourites. It has an engaging story with interesting new mechanics and a great setting (steampunk-ish WWII). You play as the commander of a small squad of militia soldiers who must fight to retake their homeland. You can fully customize your squad from a cast of characters that are colourful and interesting, each with their own back story and quirks (this includes some admittedly stereotypical but still interesting LGBT characters). The mechanics are interesting but may be hard to learn at first (don't worry you'll pick it up quick). The game also has a great water-colour-esque graphical style.This game is also note worthy because it is one of the few that explicitly addresses ethnic cleansing. I would recommend using a controller because driving a tank with a mouse is harder than you would expect."
"Lovely story which makes you play to the even if the strategy battles are somehow repetitive. In any case, the main story compensates it and it makes the game a must for manga lovers."
"Great OST, story-driven game with fleshed out characters, with RPG-like elements, such as leveling and customization."
this game is very good
"Buy this game.  It's a well-paced game that's perfect to rug up during a quiet, rainy day and brew some tea before you get yourself ready for what is one of the most immersive, well-designed games ever. This game was so highly recommended - and yet not highly recommended enough. I picked this game up on sale hearing nothing about it before hand and fluked out getting a really great story.  Has all the things I consider to be great: &gt;Art &gt;Plot &gt;Gameplay &gt;Music &gt;Worthy (but not nessescary) DLC/extras  You know a game is good when someone says the DLC is worth."
"So I bought Valkyria Chronicles last week. Actually I bought this game because the price matches my leftover money, I was never a big fan of jrpg or world-war-european theme. After a few days of playing I realised this game is so UNDERRATED. This game is a total masterpiece. And why is that? Pros : - A battle system you've never seen before. It's like when TURNBASED, RTS, FPS and WORMS had an orgy and they gave birth to this game. - Like I said before, i was never a big fan of JRPG (although I do watch some anime) but the art is mesmerizing. I love the texture, the theme, the environment, the colors, the style, everything is great. - Class system! The classes are so diversed one from another. This allows many strategies to be used. - [MINOR SPOILER] The game allows you to have a list of people in the game, this includes many informations that lets the player get to know all characters further. - Good dialogues. - The story is pure gold. - You get to choose units from a pool of many and each is unique. - Each units have traits that will affect battles. - The strategy is so implemented. If strategy is your thing, don't hesitate to download this game. - You got things to do besides the story mode. (skirmish, etc.) - You can upgrade weapons. - ISARA!!! - Isara is kinda waifu. -You can level up classes.  Cons : - Some voice actings are kinda weird, but don't worry it's like 5% and none of those are the main characters - The battle is kinda slow, rather than the adrenaline, the mental pressure is bigger. This game isn't really for you if you're looking for shooting and tankbanging real time action. - You overpower the first 15% of the game. But things are balancing up soon. - The story is way too short. It's just too hard to leave the game.  Suggestions : - PLEASE Add a DLC or two where you can continue the story or where you play as a new character related to the story. The story is so beautiful. - A function where you can fast-forward (2x) the enemy phase. - Need more in-depth interactions with the units.  Valkyria Chronicles is a masterpiece, a hattrick of tactical games. Although it's short it is a memorable game. I give this game 90/100"
"I played this game on the PS3, and it was amazing, now finding it on Steam really made my day.  Intense narrative, nice gameplay, situations that will have you thinking your moves throughly.  10/10 would have it on Play Station and PC"
Best strategy game i've ever played!!! The story is amazing!
"A neat turn-based game with a deep, character-filled story. I got really attached to my squad and was shocked when a few deaths happened.   The only downsides of the game are the occaisional crazy difficulty spikes and the loooooooooong time it takes an enemy to take turns on later maps.   All in all, a great game for tactical, turn-based players and people who like alternate history anime stories."
"Take with a grain of salt!  Looks great, i hear great things about it, however get ready for a spastic menue that you can't fix so you wont be able to actually get the game running. THERE US HOPE, some of you can fix it by afjusting a program if you have a joystick, SOME of you MAY be able to get the second input option to work. However others (like myself) will simply never be able to play it.  Hopefully you are one of those that gets the oppertunity to enjoy the game without such bugs."
combat at the end is a bit busted up but still fun fun
"This game combines a Story-like game, with a Real Time Strategy and a FPS. At the beginning I thought it was going to be kind of boring, but the story is quite appealing if you like Manga or Anime. I started enjoying it quickly and now I love it. I would definitely recommend it to otakus and geeks."
.
Great game .. Use it with the gallian crossfire mod for a harder experience
10/10 would defend invasion agian.
Been playing for a while now and so far it hasnt dissappointed =&gt;
normally i don't like these kind of games...  but holly molly this game is GOOD!!!
"Great story flow, pretty aesthetics, and even prettier gameplay. Valkyria Chronicles is the kind of experience I would love to give to more people. It's a strategy game with a lot of options for how you can tackle most missions, and despite the use of RNG for your every shot, it's just as bad for the enemies, so it feels fair most of the time, and you feel a definitive sense of progress as your characters get better, more precise and overcome even deadlier enemies.  I might play more strategy games in the future involving warfare (and in fact, I have played a fair bit before, most out of Steam), but Valkyria Chronicles probably gave me the ultimate balanced experience for it. It makes you care for the characters in the warzone so much, while giving most of them time to shine in the battlefield through their efforts, and your own. Extremely, highly recommended."
"Played this game for years, on many platforms. It is one of the most solid turn based games I have played. It introduces a few fresh ideas into the genre. Not hard to pick up on but never gets dull."
"Ways to get this game as of 02/04/2016 - Steam - Humble Bundle Sega Strategy Bundle (£5/$7 TIER)  This game.... THIS GAME IS ONE OF THOSE GAMES YOU NEED TO PLAY TO BECOME A TRUE GAMER! IF YOU DON'T OWN THIS GAME. I, Sir, pity you. you are NO TRUE GAMER. WITHOUT THIS. GAME."
"A truly great turn based strategy game: interesting combat mechanics, lots of mission variety, fun story and characters, timeless visual style, and an excellent soundtrack."
"This game can have its stupid moments but I got to say it is really addictive because of the fun, smooth, story rich gameplay. Anyone who likes turn based/strategy games should play this game. I also heard that the ANIME is pretty good to."
"Loved it from ps3 version, bought it again on Steam. Just have to love the story."
Amazing story. Beautiful art style. Amazing game play. Only drawback is the voice acting
"A goofy anime rts on the surface, and a grimdark squad game below it. Sure you do goofy stuff like build a squad based on personalities rather than skills half the time, but at the same time EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM CAN PERMA DIE. The gameplay is pretty solid too, but some of the levels are infuriating, and do not tell you what you may face most of the time.   "
"Awesome tactical game, with great storry.  I recomend it to payers that like good storry and fast tactics."
"I love this game. It's GREAT. I strongly suggest you buy it, but you gotta be a thinking person. It's a squad level strategy game, so it takes some thinking. It has a unique art style where a lot of the things (people, tanks) are hand drawn, and the rest is rendered. Also the characters are anime styled, so if you like that, you'll probably appreciate this game even more. The boss battles are a nightmare though, but if you can pull it off, you'll be damn proud of yourself. I highly recommend this game to anyone who considers themselves intelligent."
"Great gameplay, deep and engaging story.  Gorgeous visuals, distinctive art style, excellent voice acting and sound design.  Only minor quibble is that I'd like some of the animations to be skippable. But that's a VERY minor quibble.  9.5/10"
"Great History and Artwork. Cut scenes are awesome. You can't play it without falling in love with the characters. Each one of them has it's history and background. Tactical turn based strategy with JRPG elements are realy nice too.  Of course there are some downsides too, like repetitive sound, the slow enemy time and a few glitches with paths that are not acessible. But for me it is 9/10 game, worth playing."
A classic strategy title i'm surprised they did'nt release sooner on steam given there success on PC. Well worth the time. Wendy is best shocktrooper gril
Almost more watching than playing but I gotta say... this game really takes the anime genre and melds it with tactical RTS in a wonderful way. Love it! Don't miss this game.
"One of the best 7th gen strategy games ever made. It's a bit simplified, but still packs challenge. The story is superior to the anime. The music, gameplay, and visuals are all very original. Get this game strat fans!"
Great storyline and one of a kind gameplay that triggers your stragetic mind and foresight for planning ahead. A good game to see through to the end.
Worth it!
"This game is absolutely amazing. I was getting burned out playing turn-based tactics games and this title brought a fresh and innovative spin to the genre. That would have been enough for me, except not only does this game have addictive gameplay, but a AAA story and beautiful art style.  Positives:  + clever and addictive gameplay + appealing art style + energetic story with believable characters  Negatives: - I felt that it could have used a few more unit types - you have to complete missions in a limited amount of turns, which will make players who enjoy 'turtle' tactics cringe  I'm not going to give a synapsis of the story because you should play it and find out yourself, but what I will say is that this game belongs in the collection of any serious tactics/RPG fan. 9.5 out of 10!"
"Solid strategy/JRPG combination. Beautiful art styles. Great score.  Some missions can be a bit on the trying side; but never overwhelmingly difficult. Finale chapter is a bit of a let-down.  Controls can also be a bit finicky; I found I had to use both the 360 remote and a mouse to aim. Some UI choices are dodgy; reinforcements, I'm looking at you.  The alternate universe WW2 storyline is entertaining enough to pull you through the game. Nothing revolutionary here; hero squad overcomes trials and tribulations to turn the tide of the war and save the world from it's would-be oppressor.  7.5/10 "
"this game is pretty good, especially if you like strategy games, the only drawbacks are small visual glitches that usually happen to peices of armour like shoulder plates, which are quite frankly hilarious and some sharp difficulty spikes. pretty much fire emblem with tanks, guns and out of nowhere bosses. 10/10 would miss shots at huge tanks again - Groose 2016."
One of the best games i have ever played
"better than ps3 version in all ways but size of game, but pc gamers always had bigger games so no biggie"
Kill oversized tanks with exploding spears 12/10
"This is a well made turn-based 3rd person strategy game. I haven't played too much of it, but the story seems deep and interesting.  A few complaints: -Voice acting is a bit jank, but hey, I can only expect it's an english dub. -Graphics are a bit jank, but hey, this game isn't really made for good graphics. -There's this tan tint that gets on my nerves after ~20 minutes.  Overall, these are all the bad things I have seen so far. This game it actually quite enjoyable for a slower-paced single player game."
A bread baker is in the war.   10/10
this is good ♥♥♥♥
Played the demo to Codename S.T.E.A.M. and all I could think is how much I'd rather play this...
Like FF Tactics with guns.

"great art   great gameplay , turn base rpg + strategy that is good, right ?   steam has a full version , so we pay this for a full game"
I love this game!!!
"Incredible gameplay, amazing story, and unforgettable characters. This series has perfected how the modern RPG should be, Now if only theyd port the second and third one for PC too"
"Never written a review before. Felt compelled to add my meager compliments to the authors. Holy cow... this is like mellow mediatation. After a couple hours in a FPS or RTS, or straining my brain cells to the max in a 4x monster map with hundreds of items to track this is relaxing and elegant. The backstory is very clever and engaging, and the artwork sucks you in. Its like an interactive alternative history daydream. Being a 19 Delta or 11 Bravo in anime land is fun. I love the old school SKS style Gallia-1 rifle, and the Finnish/Baltic WW2 references. Do NOT expect this to be fast-paced, complex or difficult, or big on replay value. Its not meant to be. I could teach an 8 year old to play well; that being said, I enjoyed teaching my kids to play Risk and other simple games and got my booty kicked. I find Valkyria a pleasant break from the heavy hitter games, or a good way to wind down after a tough day. Milk, cocoa, cookies before bed along with an hour of Valkyria is good medicine. You won't be talking about spectacular HD headshots, or solving some thorny strategic knot in chatrooms after playing. or bragging about your leaderboard standing. So as long as you know that about the game, grab your passport and gear and head to Gallia. Smell the flowers, enjoy the meandering narrative in the generous cut scenes."
"Let's keep this short and to the point.  CONS - Main character's voice acting is meh - Unit accuracy can be annoying in the beginning - Chapters can take you quite a long time to finish  PROS - Unique gameplay - Large and diverse cast (each detailed in the journal) - Alyshia - Good balancing between each class - Everything's quite clearly explained - Port's pretty good - Fantasy WWII setting - Deep and Immersive story - Interesting lore, excitement of learning more about past heroes - Believable premises and story - Paints a lighter, yet still painful, image of war - Deep and meaningful customization for your Tank and unit equipment - Artstyle's pretty dope as well  So yeah, get this game if you're looking for a refreshing strategy JRPG. It's real fun plus it's frequently on special."
"i've played this game outside of steam several times and after playing a bit of this port, i can assure you it's a great port and a great game."
"It's like world war 2, but anime."
"Well balanced game, High dificulty, great story so far, I recomend it."
"We start out with a host of cliche characters. Almost every plot development is either obvious enough that you can see it coming from miles away, or it is inconsequential enough that you can't feel too much about it. If you've played more than one JRPG, you can see most of the plot develop three or four battles ahead. Despite this, it's executed just well enough that I cannot fault it for these things.  The battle system, at its core, is actually rather beautiful; it's a turn based strategy, where every character fits into a class, but each character has different bonuses/debuffs. Each class is necessary, and you'll find that they're rather well balanced (except that scouts seem far more powerful than shocktroopers later on, while shocktroopers are far more powerful than scouts early on).  The main game, however, is plagued with maps that are so easily blitzed by scouts that it breaks the beauty of the system. Because you're rewarded for clearing maps quickly, this is actually what you should be doing. (I did not realize this on my first playthrough, and I am quite happy for it.) I only felt like the later maps were actually challenging, and it is in those that I feel the game really shines. I must admit that the majority of my time was sunk into the later maps and class-specific challenge maps, which I have not completed. They're very fun, and make the drudge through the easy, early maps very much worth it.  The visual style is one of those 'you love it or you hate it' things. You should judge whether or not you like the aesthetic yourself; I personally like it, but there are those who dislike it.  I bought this on sale for about $7. I do not regret this, even a little; if you find this game on sale, definitely buy it. Even at full price, it's a better buy than quite a few games you'll find at $20."
"Incredibly fun game! The story line, the voice acting, the strategic depth of the missions make the experience very worthwhile. The challenging aspect of the game when it comes down to making some 'painful' decisions regarding your troops is also a plus. Definitely worth its price and a must get for SRPG fans. "
"What can I say? I love this game to death. It was the first game I bought on Steam and I've put 433.6 hours into it at this point. Yes. It does have some flaws but I was pulled into this game by the characters and interesting plot. Game-play is mostly solid. Just don't mistake it for a shooter or you will be disappointed. Realism of any kind is out the window with this one. This isn't meant to be a gritty Gears of War or Red Orchestra and the 'heavy parts' are mostly tongue and cheek. Think of it as a story rich game of chess where you can observe what your pieces are experiencing. Expect a wide variety of tones from the characters and storyline. Overall its something different, fresh, and truly memorable. I was happy to experience it thanks to the Steam port. It even made me believe that SEGA still has talent and potential.  I would also construct a list of things Sega Overworks could polish up to make this great game absolutely perfect. If you guys at Overworks see it then take this critique with love because its meant to be constructive advise.  Add auto-save between levels. Upgrade the cover system. If your clever like me you can aim around things but still. Allow cut-scenes to be skipped up front. Some people just prefer game-play. Fine tune the units, perks, and movement points system for extra balance. Make the menus a little easier to navigate. Add some sort of coop maybe? Where you and a friend can make maps and beat them together with your troops? Don't do a thing with the graphics they are beautiful. Maybe even timeless. Also localize VC3! The Western fans want it!"
"Fantastic underlooked game with a great blend of strategy and action. Although the cutesy-anime moments may put you off at times (it did me) the game is not afraid to delve into the reality of war, sometimes telling stories from an enemy's perspective. The meaning and weight of war sticks with you in this game, and while its story is not exactly perfect, and can be prone to some cliche moments, it does have some emotional impact. Also the soundtrack is composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, which is nice.  All in all, this is a great game with a few minor issues - and doesn't appeal to everyone exactly. If you're looking for a fresh strategy game, maybe this can sate your hunger."
Can we get more of these released for the pc now... pls... come on... I have money..?
Watched the Anime then played the game on PS3. Just Beautiful 
Best Pc Port i think
The first Anime I've ever enjoyed that didn't involve tentacles.
Anime World War 2 10/10
Awesome Anime Rpg long and worth the price 
"would be better if your soldiers knew how to aim, ive lost track of how many times ive had to reload the game cuz they mis an ez shot and then die."
Beautiful art style and storytelling 10/10 right in the kokoro :')
"Pros :  1. warm and clear graphic even now. 2. attractive genre; turn-based strategy game mixed with FPS and RPG. 3. good story  Cons : 1. there are many characters, but it is better to use only few main characters with a turn-increasing buff. "
i played this game for 6 hours straight and totally neglected stuff like food yeah this is a good game
"The lovechild of Anime, Hogs of War and WW2.   11/10 would like to see those guys get drunk and make love again."
Best Pc Port i think
The first Anime I've ever enjoyed that didn't involve tentacles.
"Welcome to the Robot Maid Review of ... Valkyria Chronicles™.  Valkyria Chronicles™ is a beautifully done tactical RPG that I feel I can only accurately describe the genre as 'Turn Based Tactical Third Person Shooter'. It has a great blend of difficulty that comes from various mechanics including perma-death and Command Points.  The basics of the turns are as follow. Every turn you get a certain amount of Command Points based on the units you brought in and for every CP you have, you can give one order to any of your soldiers (which will be movement and an action). The systems in place in the game force you to think every move carefully because your soldiers are not safe while they're moving (though the enemies are not safe during their movement either). Explaining all the mechanics in the game would make this review a lot longer than it really needs to be, so I'll leave it at 'the mechanics are very solid and don't seem to have any problems from what I have personally encountered'.  Moving on, the art style of the game is great. Graphics are not normally something I pay extra attention to in a game, but the style of Valkyria Chronicles™ kept my eyes glued to the screen.  As for the story, it's fantastic. It takes many inspirations from World War II, but instead of making this as a lot of action games do and using war for the plot to justify the bullets flying all over the place, the story follows a militia who simply want to end the war as soon as possible because of just how war is hell. The main characters are very well written and I even found myself caring about all my soldiers, including the ones who aren't very fleshed out compared to the main characters, attempting to keep them all out of as much danger as possible.  All in all, Valkyria Chronicles™ is a great game that definitely deserves praise and your time. The only problem I personally have with it is that it made me want to play the second and third installments of the game (not a big problem).  This has been a Robot Maid Review. Thank you for reading."
This game is a real pearl! Just try it and enjoy the story. ;)
Cannot hype this game enough!  I alrady own this game on PS3 but when I saw it was being reslised on PC I bought it agin just to show how much I love this game. the story is good and the graphics just work for this game better thna most game that try to to an anime style. the way the game works take a little getting used to crossing turn basted strategy with 3rd person shooter you need to learn each class streanth and weaknes as well as each member of your teams bounses. what eever I put here will never be enough to say say how epic this game is
This is just one of those games that you can play over and over and you always get a different experiance every time you play it. there are not meny game sout there like this where the story line and the game play mergue together so well
"Loved it. Very good story and challenging fights. Only the ranking system for the fights is a bit weird, maybe ignore it for your first playthrough."
"A little gem of tactical turn base game, with characters that grow on you"
Pretty cool game :)
"What a fantastic game. Unique gameplay, stunning art style, and decent story make for a really fun time with a good amount of strategy."
"Absolutely stellar game, and a fantastic port (only issue is the cutscenes being pre-rendered, and looking crap in comparison to gameplay). It can be a little challenging at times, and the difficulty spikes may seem unfair, but if you take your time and save often, you'll be fine. The gameplay is a little on the clunky side, but you'll be no doubt spending plenty of time with this title, so its quirks will become second nature. The story is actually surprisingly decent despites its cliches, with some solid character development and pay offs. Also, look up the mods for high def models and icons, and the one to remove the canvas borders if that suits.   I definitely recommend this title."
"Amazing anime, amazing game. Love the art design and story."
"I don't normaly play games like this, but I just can't stop."
Great concept and story. Wish there was more like this.
"Enjoyable on the PS3 and now on PC too. It is a very well done port.  The story is good and emotional, the characters are great - developing with the story, the strategy is fun, the gameplay is well-designed, and the art-style is gorgeous!  Especially when on sale, this game is a steal... A steal of your time! You can sink quite a few hours into this game once you get hooked!  The improvements you can do to the PC version do look incredibly nice, however the PS3-like settings still provide a unique charm. It is very well optimized and has good controller support (despite the xbox button prompts)  Just don't watch the anime before you finish the game"
Lots of fun turn-based strategy levels with plenty of good story in between. Would recommend.
It's great
"Amzing game, the 2nd best of the series, I highly recomend playing Valkyria Chronicles 3 too (the 2nd is completely optional and feels like a filler for the story)"
loved this game.
Always wanted to play this when my cousins were on the PS3. Here's hoping we'll get VC2!!
"Compelling storyline and a beautiful art style merge together in Valkyria Chronicles. In this game you control a squad in the war torn country of Gallia. You are able to choose the members of your squad, progress down various weapon tech trees, customize the strengths of your tank, and fine tune who you take into the various battle scenarios!"
"Loved this game when I had it for PS3, couldn't pass up getting it with full DLC during Summer Sale on PC!  Only gripe is that to get full S, you are forced to be suicidal on some maps."
"Loved this game when I had it for PS3, couldn't pass up getting it with full DLC during Summer Sale on PC!  Only gripe is that to get full S, you are forced to be suicidal on some maps."
"At first, I thought this would be a bad port of Sega as usual. I got it when it was on sale, a good price for a try. Nothing to complain, actually, it is amazing.  Good graphic, good sound, addictive gameplay... Will absolutely recommend it!"
An excellent juxtaposition of cartoony anime kid hero style with a dark and horrifying story.
One of the best JRPGs of it's generation with unique gameplay and beautiful art style. Excellent PC port with Japanese audio option.
"This game has very nice gameplay,story, character design. everything is perfect, you won't regret buying this game"
"What's not to like about this game it's got, big guns, hot girls and cinnamon rolls,  I honestly hate strategy games, I get frustrated bored and angry and the only reason I bought this was for VYSE, Aika and Fina.   I decided to give this a try because I was fed up of seeing my nephew play Call of duty:SSDD and you know what I LIKE IT.   It is different and beautiful, Albeit very story driven and has little gameplay in between scenes (in the beginning)."
Anime's best take on World War 2 to date.
"I love this game. Having always been a fan of tactical rpgs, I found the gameplay offered here to be a breath of fresh air. While there isn't massive levels of customization, the personalities on display make each character feel completely different. You may let a character die in X-Com, but you'll have difficulty not reloading here when one of your favorite characters hit the dirt.  The story is generally predictable, in the way that only JRPGs can be, but there are a few surprising moments with some painful twists along the way.  This isn't even mentioning the art style! Oh, this game is, and will be, gorgeous for years and years to come!"
"This is by far one of the best games that has ever been created, if you have not taken the chance to experience this masterpiece, you are truely missing out on a beautifuly told story with an amazing art style."
Not into anime much really but this game is rather splendid. I hope they release its other itterations also.   Buy it on discount you wont regret one dime spend.
"First time through, you'll enjoy the game and fall in love with everything you see. Second time through you'll be so engrossed that you can't wait to beat the snot out of the baddies.  Worth it. 100%"
You screw with magic and absurdly large tanks in the middle of World War II and pick up a girlfriend along the way 10/10
"Great artstyle, characters, and an excellent battle system."
"A superb port of a game, a real gem. I found myself from beginning to end really addicted to finishing the story and what a story, the mechanics are simple the game play is fairly easy to het used too. The game simply left me wanting more, even though there are sad moments and some happy ones I WANT MORE! I only wish more ports were as good as this amazing exception."
Best turn based strategy mechanics ever
Perfect
"I find this game to be rather like being a part of the story of an anime. It's a decent story, the battles have some strategy to them and are fun. Somewhat limited replayability but the artwork is incredible. While it's in an anime style, the colouring is like it was done using watercolours and has a great look to it. Someone looking for pure action or X-Com like battles won't find that but the turn based tactical battles are good and are fun. It shows it's a console port of course and plays better with a gamepad but that's fine. Overall I love this game and am enjoying the story."
Everything (including WWI) is better with anime...
Clearly the best use of anime in a game.
Really loved this game and I would really like to play the sequel but that will probley never happen. Since somehow they thought it was a good idea to transition from a console game to a handheld game for some weird reason.
"Played this game multiple times on my Playstation, and the sequels on my PSP. Cheesy story, yes, but excellent gameplay, and likeable characters. You will love your squad, believe me."
"I still need to play a lot more of Valkyria Chronicles, but from ive played so far, i can say the game is beautiful adn the gameplay is very fun!"
"Pros: - Incredible missions that allow unique and creative ways to win - Plenty of customization for characters, gear and tanks! - Great storyline that's not super cheesy - Innovative combat system that is majorly turn-based with unique elements  Cons: - Tanks can be buggy to operate on PC"
"One of the best games in existence 11/10 Original, Fun, Good soundtrack, Good story, Alicia. just some of the good points of the game"
  Waifus ✓   TRPG ✓   Nice story ✓   Tank Waifus ✓   Extra large tank Waifus ✓   What else do you need?
"This is an awesome game. I played it three times over and I am still not bored. Every character ingame has his unique characteristics. Fears, feelings towards different characters and so on. I can recommend it to everyone who wants to play a war themed, round based, strategy game."

It's cute and fun except ♥♥♥♥ that giant tank boss
"I downloaded this game after being midly interested by it's artstyle and gameplay tags. Little did I know that I had stumbled upon my perfect game.  Allow me to run it down for you  -War drama -Love story -Likeable characters -Compelling underdog story straight out of anime -Well thought out and just all around fun combat system -Beautiful artstyle - etc.  If I had to have a couple of complaints about the game  -Tank driving can be difficult sometimes -Pieces of character models seem to float in midair sometimes  If you like what you see, and are willing to ignore the minor flaws, get ready for one hell of a ride."
"  I love this game! I had is back when it was on PlayStation. Loved it then, and came back to it years later when it was on Steam. The artwork still looks beautiful. The characters, while often tropes, are still endearing and a lot of fun, and managing your recruits can be very interesting. You can't always play favorites depending on the map. And the story is great! VIt can be silly and dramatic, but the shifts fell quite natural.  The follow up game is far goofier, but this one is solid."
"when i first saw this game i had my doubts on it being an awesome game but after i played it when i bought it on a discount it was amazing ! the story and gameplay was gripping me to the pc screen for hours :) , i'm glad to have played this game and i would gladly recommend this game to my friends"
The Japanese version of World War 2
Scout Rush Simulator
"A game I truly enjoyed. The story is thrilling, moving and even heartbreaking."
One of the best series I have played
"A friend recommended this game to me. I are not much for turn-based games. But after playing a while I just loved it. Great sound track- The story can be a little bit predictable but you get to love the characters, even the bad guys or the secondary characters. To the point that losing one secondary character in field will get you sad or even some times reset your game to the last saved point."
"It's slightly better on the Playstation, but this remains a truly amazing game."
"It's one of those games. Where your sniper must hit that one target with 60% accuracy or you'll have to redo 20 minutes of your life, because you don't want anyone to die.  In other words, a great game. "
"This is one of the best game I've ever played. The control may be a bit rough on the PC (Highly suggest a controller) but this game visit some themes that we rarely see in videogame. It's about war, about love, about racism, and about being strong when all your world goes to ♥♥♥♥. Highly recommend this game !"
"Awesome art style, nice story and a good gameplay"
"Simply one of the best strategy game. Perfect combination of great graphics and great gameplay. Fun and addictive. You should totally buy this game, even at the original price. It's on SALE right now so just go and buy it if you haven't yet!!"
its a great game with the mix of a FPS and a nice RPG story to go with
"Great game with a great battle system. It can be frustrating at times, but with a small change in tactics any battle can be won easily"
This game instantly became one of my favorites on the PS3. Enough so that I shelled out for it again on Steam. The combination of story and game mechanics are enthralling. You really get to feel empathy for your characters. They really aren't the faceless minions like many games. It's even full of meta games like building coordinated squads for maximum benefit. If I thought this game had a downside is that it has no multiplayer. I'd love to play this game in VS mode.
"My favourite anime game of all time! Own 4 different versions of the game. If art was a video game, this would be it. Great melodramatic story. Memorable characters. Gameplay is not too easy yet not too difficult."

"Superb on the PS3, superb on the PS4 and superb on the PC. Cheap, too. There's really no reason not to have this in your collection. Plus, it comes with all the available DLC.  ALERNATE REVIEW: Missed target because of grass pollen. Would miss again. 10/10."
"I enjoy this game but lord I hate the ranking system. You're told to be slow and careful and not let people die, but then the game goes 'LOL NO S RANKS FOR YOU THEN SUCKER, CAUSE THAT ♥♥♥♥'S BASED ON TURNS TAKEN!' And the turn times you have to meet for S ranks are so ridiculous that they force you to do ♥♥♥♥ that is actively discouraged in the tutorial. This does not scream good game design to me.  Aesthetics are fun though and the plot is alright so far, I just hate the ranking system with a passion. Be ready to save-scum to hell and back because some of the ♥♥♥♥ the game pulls is pretty absurd."
One of the best japanese game. Greate style and atmosphere. Fight mechanics give much fun. Maybe the story is not the strongest point for western player but I like it a lot. RPG elements are well thought same as tactical fights. They give many satisfaction. Of course the characters are a little exaggerated just like in japanese production but I like it and I think it maches to the game. I recommend japan fans and people search some unique in game.
Nice Story Nice Gameplay Nice Sountrack  10/10
Great game.
the best story ever
"It really is a good game. Take time to get used to the controls and you won't regret it. A heads up, there was a problem I encountered in a certain mission, it had to do with tanks and a steep backwards climb, to anyone who wants to get past there, just set fps to 30 for that mission (if you were playing at 60 fps). Solid story, good depth... Oh, to those who played this, throw the 'I'm not Crying, There's Something in my Eye' award this way, or is it just me?"
"Excellent modern SRPG. I'm surprised by the quality of this game, it has stellar gameplay and a decent story (the only exception being I didn't think the leveling system or the potentials were very fleshed out or impactful).  The story/plot is on par with fire-emblem, although the lack of support conversations leaves much lacking in the character developmnet, you do get the character tab that at leasts gives some depth to the other characters.   Gameplay is exteremly tight and fun. The game presents a consistent challenge throughout as well, which is a big bonus.  If you're a fan of SRPG's this one is a must for you!"
"Fantastic gameplay. To me, Valkyria Chronicles is the perfect blend between traditional turn-based gameplay and 1st-person shooters. Personally, I've always been a big fan of strategy-based games (i.e. Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy, Pokemon, Skies of Arcadia, etc.), and this game earns its place among those ranks. It's super rewarding to consistently level-up your classes and see your favorite characters progressively kick butt harder and harder as the story progresses. Also, the animation style and unique and anime-based and both the English and Japanese voice acting is superb. All around outstanding execution! (9.5/10)"
I've been playing this on and off for two years and always come back to it. The combination of real time and strategy based elements are fun and compelling. The classic Anime story line and stylistic animation draws you in. It's difficult enough that you certainly can't play it quickly through so provides long value. I'm sure I'll keep chipping away at it until I finish it up and I will miss it.
A lot of anime and also guns and sossage :)
"The gameplay is somewhat reminicent of Fire Emblem in its combat style but still very unique. The storyline is decent and the gameplay is fun. At times some mechanics such as the blue radiator things can make the game a bit frustrating however, with a good strategy this shouldn't usually be a problem. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Fire Emblem or similar games, or someone who enjoys a decent strategy game."
"I played this game when it was first released on PS3 and it's great through and through. This is a fantastic port, I was thoroughly suprised by how everything works perfectly, no control needed. I actually like the mouse and keyboard layout better for this one. If you like games like Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem then this game will fit you like a glove. The World War asthethics also makes the game very immersive. If you grew up playing japanese games you owe it to yourself to play this through this gem. Definitely a classic."
This RPG has a well written story with interesting characters. I don't play many strategy RPGs so I found a lot of missions tough. I enjoyed the game very much nonetheless and I would recommend the game to others. The game took me over 60 hours to complete.
"Really great game, but some missions are really annoying/the objective is unclear. Also you can't restart a mission while in a mission, which means to restart an encounter you have to have either saved at the start of a mission or kill your main tank. Just save often and you won't be as frustrated. Story is pretty generic animu stuff.   TIP: You can save in the middle of a mission by pressing esc and selecting system and save."
best story driven game i played in a while
It's Good If you like third person stratergy
"Anime story got a little silly at times, particularly with that annoying pig, but gameplay-wise this is a really interesting concept. If you are a strategy game enthusiast, then this game should provide you with some new challenges."
"Played it on PS3 and loved it , really good pc port"
Love this game wish Valkyria Chronicles 2 would come to PC i would get that game too.
Very fun strategy turn-based RPG with a great story.
"Sooo good. Yet surprisingly long amount of game play time! I was very happy to see a PC port of Valkyria Chronicles :) Interesting game play mechanics, where you control one unit at a time in third person mode, yet weaving in a rng and rts element altogether? More please."
"Played it on the PS3 console and loved so much had to buy it on the PC. Great storyline, great artwork in a fun turn-based tactical warfare game."
I will forever love this game.
Getting a headshot with a tank was never this satisfying

"Never been a fan of anime personally but I'll make an exception for this game. I want more of it, but SEGA in their infinite wisdom only ever made the sequels on PSP."
"Sound track is good. Story is good.   BUT just not so happy with the scoring system after each fight. The less rounds you take to finish a mission, the better score you will have. Wut??!!   Alright, still fun."
Can't handle these feels mayne ;~;
Best strategy game ive ever played
Awesome art! Amazing soundtracks! Heart-touching story!  What can I say more?
Valkyria Chronicles is a strategy game with a gorgerously hand drawn artstyle similar to reading a classic book. The story unfolds between missions and you get attached the characters as you play. The story pulls you in while having light hearted and darker moments that tug on your heart strings. There are some hidden sidequests for replayability. This game is definitly worth a playthough and should be on every Steam users shopping list. Valkyria Chronicles should receive the test of time reward for it's unique art style that will endure just like classic storybooks do.
Need a sequal on Steam ASAP
"I spent most of my play time for this game on the PS3, and repurchased it here when I traded the old brick in. In short, it's a magnificent game. It tells a compelling story, the characters are endearing, and the mechanics are some of the most simple yet effective in any game of its genre. It's really a unique and fun experience, and I'd recommend it to anyone who hasn't played it."
"Just try it. Seriously, just try it."
Super Recommend! Wasn't sure what to expect but fell in love with the story and super addicted to the gameplay. The art and music really mixed it all very well. Didn't want it to end..
Very good game. One of my favorites from the PS3. Bought the PC version so that I could play it again when I didn't have time to play console games.
You are beautiful like the back of a pleasing fungus beetle &lt;3
"its great, had a fun time, all the characters have a backstory (which i find super cool btw) its on sale rn. really what are you wating for"
Very good turn based strategy game with an excellent story
"Great game, 10/10"
"I've sunk hours and hours into the Playstation 3 version, and another allotment of hours into the PC port. That's only the start for a great game like this."
Played mostly on ps3. a beautiful game with a good story and great characters. a lot of content for your money worth.
"I nominated this game for the 'I'm not crying, there's something in my eye' award."
"Turn based strategy game with a flavor of alternative history World War 2. The plot is silly but palatable, the control scheme makes sense, the graphics have that hand drawn cell shaded feel and honestly. the only negative I can think of is some clunky menus. Otherwise, a joy to play."
It's got anime and tanks.
"I went looking for this game back in 2009 because I heard the main theme, and I wanted to play the game that had such gorgeous music. I was not disappointed in the slightest. Fast forward to last year, and they did a fantastic job porting it to PC. The gameplay is a great hybrid of turn-based planning and real-time action; I can't understand why more games (especially RPGs) don't try to mimic that.  Oh, and the song Rosie sings halfway through the game makes a solid case for this game winning the 'got something in my eye' category as well."
If only all ports ran this well
Nice story and art. Characters are dynamic and lovely
The only RTS + ThirdPersonShooterlike + Turn based strategy game that i know
"This is a good game. I bought it when it was full price and it was 100% worth it. The story was well written and the gameplay was fun. Though to proceed through some levels it takes a bit of grinding beforehand. The levels were challenging but not too hard. The characters really draw you in. The game makes you feel responsible for each character by giving them all realistic backstories. It also reminds you that you are not above consequences because if your characters die and you don't get a medic they are dead. Permanately. Overall 9,7/10."
This game has been a fairly good remaster of the original game that has beeen brought over to the PC. If you have not noticed there was an anime made to market this game and their sucess is questionable. But least i can say that the game has far fewer heartbreaks than the anime itself  As for gameplay and graphics live up to that of the other titles that have been released over the years on the PSP and PS platforms but are not yet ported to the PC.  Basically this is a turn based RTS so if you people like your X COM then this might be worth a try  
"This game almost made me cry. No other game has done that. Beautifully executed game, well worth the money and the time you will spend with it."
Best Tactical Strategy Game Ever!
"Do you like Japanese RPGs? Do you enjoy turn-based combat games similar to X-Com?  This PS3 port made by SEGA's Skies of Arcadia devs has everything covered for those who answered yes to the two former questions.   Enjoy it, it's memorably good. I bought a PS3 so I could finally get a copy."

Fun game if you like anime with a dash of turn based gameplay.
Love this game i was not sure at 1st but i when i started it and got to play tho the levels i really injoyed it 10 out of 10
Completed the game when it was first released on the PS3. It has a great story and excellent innovative gameplay mechanics. A must buy game for anyone who is up for some mixed turn based strategy game with a great story and beautiful anime styled artwork. 
This game brings a war strategy board to a very enticing story line. I like how it's not to hard that it seems impossible but it's enough of a challenge you can loose a few times but still learn what you did wrong each time.
A Really good Game i could play this game for hours and hours without getting bored
"  It's got story, guns, strategy and Drama. It actually hurt to lose people."
"This game has everything that is necessary to be a top game, and at same time has none of the 'traditional' schematics to do it.  Basically the game handles emotions/strategy/history in a simple and easy way that can keep you playing and playing without notice the time passed.  Just give a try and you will love it :)"
"Beautiful art, beautiful story, fun (HOW THE ♥♥♥♥ DID THAT TANK GET A HEADSHOT ON MY SNIPER FROM THAT FAR AWAY!?) but rage inducing gameplay. Absolute masterpiece of a game"
"one of my favorite games of all time -plenty of stratagey  -plenty of options -plenty of content -plenty of story -plenty of music -plenty of feels -plenty of time   I think this game deserves more attention it is a really great game, but not as popular as ot shold be. This is worth more than its price and i think this is batter than most triple-a titles and it is much cheaper. so not even considering the price i think this game is amazing, and seeing as how it is cheaper than a lot of other games this is definetly worth it"
The story was good. Worth playing if you like strategy games like Fire Emblem.
"Wonderful graphics, great tactical gameplay, better than expected voice acting, this game really has it all. Now if only they'd release Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 for the PC too..."
-Inventive and fun strategic gameplay -Great characters and story -Beautiful design One of the best strategy RPGs I have ever played.
"This is a fun game, buy it"
"Great story, interesting gameplay style."
"Great game, great story. I love it. :)"
Loved it on the PS and loved it here. I got a good format and great art drection.
"Fun, will consume time to play it properly but fun, I like it."
^.^
"Valkyria Chronicles is one of a kind. This has two sides: the good, and the not so good. The good thing is, you're going to enjoy playing it. A lot. The not so good: you won't find another game like this once you've played the heck out of it. Valkyria Chronicles will keep its appeal for years to come. The reason is some outstanding design choices. By placing the action in a fictional, I World War-alike game, situations and characters ooze proximity and realism while not offering any surface for attacking the game's historical accuracy; the technology will never feel outdated; the comic-style art never goes out of fashion; and the technology chosen to blow life into that art is perfectly capable of moving everything in your screen smoothly enough. The story and characters are also likeable, and the gameplay itself has set a standard for games like the latest UFO: Enemy Unkown iterations.  All in all, VC is a timeless classic. You owe it to yourself to try this game."
Best WWI game that is not even about WWI.

"Any tag in your interest ? Story Rich Anime , Turn-Based Tactic Go for it."
"Finally have been able to play Valkyria! The game is awesome! It is anime with old style strategy system which is common for Japanese games, manily PSP games whom I love so much! I recommend it to everyone to try it. The price should probably be around 13-15e but it got great story so 5 more euro isn't that bad deal."
"Great game, and Alicia is cuter than the anime version, in my opinion :3"
"Great game, story and stylish graphics. Would like to see a new Skies of Arcadia though from the very same developer. This game is 8/10."
Very Nai
Anime World War 2 10/10
"Welcome to the Robot Maid Review of ... Valkyria Chronicles™.  Valkyria Chronicles™ is a beautifully done tactical RPG that I feel I can only accurately describe the genre as 'Turn Based Tactical Third Person Shooter'. It has a great blend of difficulty that comes from various mechanics including perma-death and Command Points.  The basics of the turns are as follow. Every turn you get a certain amount of Command Points based on the units you brought in and for every CP you have, you can give one order to any of your soldiers (which will be movement and an action). The systems in place in the game force you to think every move carefully because your soldiers are not safe while they're moving (though the enemies are not safe during their movement either). Explaining all the mechanics in the game would make this review a lot longer than it really needs to be, so I'll leave it at 'the mechanics are very solid and don't seem to have any problems from what I have personally encountered'.  Moving on, the art style of the game is great. Graphics are not normally something I pay extra attention to in a game, but the style of Valkyria Chronicles™ kept my eyes glued to the screen.  As for the story, it's fantastic. It takes many inspirations from World War II, but instead of making this as a lot of action games do and using war for the plot to justify the bullets flying all over the place, the story follows a militia who simply want to end the war as soon as possible because of just how war is hell. The main characters are very well written and I even found myself caring about all my soldiers, including the ones who aren't very fleshed out compared to the main characters, attempting to keep them all out of as much danger as possible.  All in all, Valkyria Chronicles™ is a great game that definitely deserves praise and your time. The only problem I personally have with it is that it made me want to play the second and third installments of the game (not a big problem).  This has been a Robot Maid Review. Thank you for reading."
"When you play a decent amount in offline mode so it doesn't look like you've actually played the game, anyways good game m8."
"would be better if your soldiers knew how to aim, ive lost track of how many times ive had to reload the game cuz they mis an ez shot and then die."
Beautiful art style and storytelling 10/10 right in the kokoro :')
I was promised XCOM style gameplay . . . Close enough
It gets really good after first few chapters
"  this game is simply amazing. The visuals and the gameplay are both superbe. The story is good, although a bit predictable. Even if many people regard this game as really hard, I found it challenging the right. So, to sum up, everyone MUST buy this."
"played this game on the PS3 and I still have it  regardless of what the PC elitist try to say about it having trouble running on the PS3 (lol, they're so funny.. a game which could run on a toaster) it ran perfectly, although with a lower resolution and fps cap.   I really didn't see a point in getting this besides wanting to support Sega in order to, hopefully, justify them porting the subsequent games in the series since I never played em due to not having a PSP.   as far as the game is concerned, its an amazing strategy RPG which comes highly, highly recommended to the fans of the genre. There's really nothing for me to say which hasn't already been said."
"If you are older you might remember final fanasty tactics. If that's the case and you enjoyed it, you will most likely enjoy this game. For anyone who hasn't played those games, this game is most similar to xcom in weeaboo format.  Graphics are 'good' and the game runs smooth.  Story is as if a drunk whine-o gave you a history lesson on ww2, but it's quite interesting.  I would rate this game 8.5/10   "
"Yeah its on sale, the only way you could not like this is if you were dropped on your head at birth."
"So i missed this one on its initial release for the ps3, really didnt have an interest in the pc version until it hit Playfire. The store page really does not do it any justice. This is a must play. Basically your a small country at war with a really big country over an element called ragnite. Its an RTS, and it does require a lot of strategy. How many snipers to take, do i need lancers, what will i ever use an engineer for. Whats really cool about this is how the story is presented. Just like that, a storybook.   Awesome story graphics are beautiful, i mean that, they are stunning sound is great, music is great  The one drawback, it is very story driven. The story takes about as long as a mission for each chapter. However, they have a skrimish option if your chomping at the bit to fight.  This is all i'm gonna say, just buy the fracking game, sit down and love it.  10/10 worth the money: yes!"
"Pros :  1. warm and clear graphic even now. 2. attractive genre; turn-based strategy game mixed with FPS and RPG. 3. good story  Cons : 1. there are many characters, but it is better to use only few main characters with a turn-increasing buff. "
"The lovechild of Anime, Hogs of War and WW2.   11/10 would like to see those guys get drunk and make love again."
" https://youtu.be/am9taqsG6mE   Based in a world not that dissimilar to our own, 'Valkyria Chronicles™' tells the story of how a small country losing its neutrality and being drawn into a brutal conflict.  The tactical combat still holds up long after it's original release and provides players with lots of customization options in how they improve their troops and equipments. The visual style also hides the game's age well, but some of the pre-rendered cinematics can be aliased around the edges."
Awesome Anime Rpg long and worth the price 
i played this game for 6 hours straight and totally neglected stuff like food yeah this is a good game
"Valkyria Chronicles is truly a one-of-a-kind game, bringing a gorgeous graphical style, fun gameplay and a heart-wrenching story, and although it suffers from a few issues, still shines as one of the best games I have yet to play.   The story itself is cleverly written, and throughout the game's roughly 60-hour campaign, will make you laugh, cry and cheer in victory as you conquer another level. The voice acting, although sounding slightly weak in English, does not dampen the enjoyment at all. Gameplay is solid, smooth and addicting, being a mixture of a third-person shooter and a tactical RPG, however the controls can sometimes lead to awkward maneuvering and the enemy AI can occasionally be silly. The grameplay stays fresh throughout the entire game and doesn't become stale or repetitive, thanks to the large variety of weapon upgrades and customization, and the ability to change your squad roster, letting you create and devise your own strategies without becoming overwhelmingly difficult.   I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys strategic rpg's, and I also feel that the gameplay is exciting and immersive enough to be great fun for everyone."
"It's usually a great sign when a game has gotten me engaged for this many hours and this game is really no exception, the story welp it's supposed to make a direct reference to World War II but with magical elements and typical RPG tropes. Dive into the role of commander Welkin Gunther and Squad 7 while you fight to stop the ambitions of an evil empire.  The presentation of it is just absolutely gorgeous and clever with it taking the format of a compiled book going about the legendary exploits of Squad number 7 and their day by day lives, you get to see every moment of joy, sadness, agony, every argument and even get a glimpse on the bad guys lives too, the game focuses a lot on certain characters but they are usually well written and are generally likeable, seriously it manages to convey that feeling of urgency to keep everyone alive that Fire Emblem was usually well known for but in its own way(more on that in the next few lines).  Gameplay wise this is a strategy game, however rather than just moving all your units and go combat happy you get a limited amount of movements per turn, meaning you gotta select a few units and think carefully about your moves, unlike Fire Emblem there's no perma death unless one of your troops gets shot down and then an enemy comes around to finish them off. Also depending on how well you do on missions you can collect better rewards, which in turn help better train your troops, upgrade their weapons and other stuff. There are a few classes, each with their own sets of advantages and disadvantages that you really have to get the grasp on quickly in order to succeed, but the game for the most part is lenient... EMPHASIS on 'For The Most Part' cus if you're unprepared then prepare to get your nuts(or ovaries) squeezed till you beg for mercy, also most maps are well thought out but of course a few times I felt it went nuts and suddendly just decided to ramp up the difficulty out of nowhere, I'm looking at you ♥♥♥♥ing huge tank mission.  All in all if you ask me wether you should buy this game then my answer is ♥♥♥♥ YES, I personally give it an 8.5/10"
"I just started this, and so far I really like the game. I always had a thing for Final Fantasy Tactics and espacially Fire Emblem. This feels very similar, with its anime style and turn-based tactical combat.  I have a few grudges with Valkyria Chronicles however. First off: The presentation is really weak. And by that I don't mean the graphics, I mean the way your missions are presented. The menu is a book, and on every 2 pages there will be a mission. And up to 7 (!) cutscenes. Most of the times you watch a cutscene, go back to the book, choose another cutscene. That just feels tedious. I like the characters, but I want to play a game. For example: Once you get to the army academy you are told to explore the academy, and from now on you can go to the armory, R&amp;D etc. But why do I have to do that via menu? Why can't I really explore the academy by walking through it?  Also, going into this with Fire Emblem in mind I was hoping that I would bond with all of my characters. I don't, because while they do have unique names, looks and properties, they don't really have a personality and you just recruit them via menu. You learn nothing about them.   Now I listed a lot of negative things, but I really do enjoy this game. If you like FFT and Fire Emblem and you want a game with a different type of world, this is for you. It is just not perfect."
Not going to be professional about this review but game's awesome. Awesome that you need to plan every move you make or your troops are going down. 10/10
"I enjoyed this game as it was a good turn based game that also allowed you to take control of your characters on the battlefield. It isn't a simple command troops and watch it unfold, you can avoid incoming fire as it's your turn. It almost feels like RTS. The story isn't too bad either and give you a sense that you're fighting for something. Characters were interesting and most of the game is voice acted. It's a lovely game."
"Nice turn base RPG I waited so long to released on PC, I love this game so much because I am a Turn base strategy lover xD"
You can complete almost every battle with one unit in less than 3 turns.   Great strategy game.
This isn't or rather wasn't my type of game but saw it on sale and was always curious and actually quite liked it. I enjoyed the story enough and the gameplay was actually really fun. Got my two friends to buy it and they liked it too. Japanese voices are way better than the english ones though in my opinion.
Oh boy A fun turn-based tactical strategy that will melt me away by its characters.  nature/10
"This game is very resemblant of many other JRPG turn-based and strategy games, yet still unique in its own way. In my best way to describe this to my friends, I say it's an FPS/Strategy game, namely because that's the two types of games Valkyria Chronicles manages to blend together. And they do it quite well, if I'm being honest. This truly is a hidden gem that I never heard about until my brother recommended it to me after watching a playthrough of the first chapter on YouTube. So, let me start this out by saying, if you have ever played Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy Tactics, or any other such JRPG turn-based strategy games, then you will enjoy this game. And for those of you who are into the more FPS realm of gaming, you might also find this to be a very fun game, albeit full of tactics and strategical descsions, but still plenty of FPS fun.  9/10 (for reasons pertaining to interaction between supporting cast characters being limited)  A good game for any JRPG/Strategic/FPS gamer to try out and I wish SEGA would release the second on Steam, I think they really struck gold with this game. Too bad they keep trying to bring back the glory days of Sonic the Hedgehog..."

Its actually fun and has a nice little story to it. Your team members can die in battle making it rogue-like but you can rescue them fairly easily.
Almost as good as actually going to war.
I loved it so much on PS3 that I just had to own it here as well. It's one of my favorites on PS3 along with LBP1/2
 THIS GAME IS FANTASTIC. A HIDDEN GEM IN THE RPG WORLD
"very fun game, unique design. MY only complaint is the 'single/duo' missions are stupid and should never have been in the game. Hope there arent alot of them!"
Before I begin this review i'd like to say.....   THIS IS GAME OF THE CENTURY  ...The best damn game i've ever played as of yet and I got to experience it thanks to a wonderful friend of mine sharing his steam library with me and will purchase the game when I can!   Valkyria Chronicles is a turn based RPG with battles that won't bore you after a while and an anime art style that is absolutely gorgeous! The game takes place in the fictional world of Europa during a great war between the land of Gallia and the Imperials. Gallia is a small portion of the continent compared to what the Imperials have and the Imperials think it's going to be a walk in the park to claim the land but noooo they were wrong. The Gallians have the son of a war hero named Welkin Gunther who at first had no interest in fighting the war but was dragged into it due to some events. I won't go any further cause I would spoil the whole game at this rate. The story is too damn good and has enjoyable battle system that is fairly easy to get used to that reminds me of the way Fire Emblem plays.   I played this game on the bare minimum requirements cpu wise (Core2Duo E4400 @2.0Ghz) and hardly had any frame drops except when there was a lot of action going on. Modern cpus shouldn't have an issue though. Valkyria Chronicles is an excellent example of what a PC port should be like. Good job Sega! Do I recommend this game?  YES YES YES YES YES YES
"I'd been itching to find another good strategy game and this little number I found sitting in the 'well-user rated' page of the strategy games caught me by surprise. When it said soemthing along the lines of turn-based strategy which is evidently similar to XCOM despite never playing the series, I was unsure of what to think, since most strategy I stuck to was RTS like C&amp;C or Starcraft. Plus, I am an avid story-interest guy when it comes to anything, and the allure of a (supposedly) riveting story coupled with strategy seemed like it was worth the 20 dollar leap. And it was oh so worth it.  I didn't expect to get this absorbed into a strategy game with a huge slew of characters with whom I thoroughly enjoyed, both main and side characters. The story itself is quite magnificent seeing as how its essentially a re-envisioning of the real-life WWI/WW2 with some, extra, mystifying elements added into the mix, which didn't seem to detract at all from the story, in fact it made it even more unique and interesting. The world of the game is intriguing and the gameplay itself was fresh and magnificent for me since I've never played anything of the sort, although I did have some qualms with playing this game at the start and as it went along.  Most apparent of issues from the beginning, although it quickly became less of a nuisance, was the menu; no mouse needed anywhere and was heavily reliant on the keyboard if not only keyboard-reliant. I had initially found keyboard operation in battles choppy and not very accurate until I found the right keys for them so that removes that issue. Probably the most struggling of features in this game is just the pure chance of things. Even though battles are fought through the player's actions and actual real-time decisions in aiming and movement, I found it incredibly frustrating seeing how bad chance could play out at times where bullets at point blank range would miss and cost my team valuable CP ('command points' which are the lifeblood of every match) and even their lives. On another less-immersing and troubling note was that to obtain high ranks, battles had to be won with lightning speed and blitzkrieg tactics mainly involving the scout class alone, meaning slow, methodical pushes with all your forces were usually not advised for high-scoring missions, which made it feel less like a full-scale battle, but those are hardly bad points.   Aside from those only sour points I had with the game, everything good with the game easily made up for its annoyances. The amount of strategy and decision one can put into the team BEFORE the battles even start is astounding and almost felt overwhelming. You had to handpick each of your squadmembers from the command roster and each person had their own strengths and weaknesses, and each of those strengths and weaknesses would pertain to their fellow teammates, the battlefields they would tread upon, and so many more criteria that made soldier selection so very diverse for every situation you will be faced with. Even better, the very gear and equipment you would bring into battle had many branching upgrade and choice options making the depth of pre-battle planning so incredibly diverse and immersive. Nearly a third of the time logged into this game has admittably been me listening in on mission briefings, choosing the most acceptable soldiers, gearing each one for their roles, and inspecting the other various side elements outside of battle like the extremely vast amount of backstories, world mythos, and 'reports' or side missions per-say, that kept me at this game for nearly 40+ hours, with free DLC to boot with the 20 dollar tag.   I don't know what else to point out at this point, this game just has some much fun to it despite some of its slight shortcomings. I even hear they have VC2 and VC3 available on the PSP, so here's hoping they port some of those to other consoles someday because I want more of this stuff. Gripping story, gripping gameplay, this thing will have you glued for hours to come. Definitely worth the buy for only 20 bucks. 9.5/10 for reals.  "
"I played this on the PS3 and it was easily one of my favorite games of that generation. A unique take on turn based strategy, combining a real time action section where you control and fight as your units in a third-person shooter style and a touching story set in a fantastical pseudo WWII setting. The aesthetic of the game is also exceptional with gorgeous watercolor painting style graphics that were especially impressive for its time, like a painting come to life."
"我十分，特别，非常讨厌这个评分系统。。为什么一个战棋游戏的评分只和回合数挂钩啊。。不全灭敌人和咸鱼有什么区别= =  I really really hate the battle rating system, it is hilarious that in a SLG the rating you get after battle is only affected by number of turns. There is no fun in there for letting large bunch of enemies alive after the battle when you have enough fire power to burn them down."
"TL;DR: There are very little strategy or tactic components in VC; it is more like an animate visual novel that allows players to re-enact the battles following a pre-written script. Watch the animated version if you don't have time to spare.  I actually somewhat don't hate this game, especially given the fact that it's first published on PS3 in 2008. The graphic is ok, the fully animated and voiced cutscenes shows good effort, the plot is kinda cheesey but still acceptable ( just like most of the Japanese animates), it also offers a good variety of weapons and skills to choose from, it's somehow an acceptable turn-based strategy/tactical game. However, I still cannot recommend it.  The biggest problem VC has is it doesn't really have any AI system in it's NPCs and enemies.  All enemy units just move to their predetermined positions and using specific skills every turn regardless of the situation, and will sit there until the end of the world if you don't bother to get in contact with them.  There is little (or next to nothing) 'creative' or 'your own way' of playing this game except following the walkthrough.  Almost every stage can be solved in less than 5 turns if you follow the walkthrough to the very extent (by that I mean: move the specific character to a specific location and doing exactly what the guide tells you to), otherwise you will have a quiet difficult fight and receive low score.   It's somewhat sad to see how this game fails to deliver more tactic or strategy essences to its players. I mean, it has a decent basic system and good graphic (2008 standard) with full voice cast, and will be a great game if you can play it like XCOM, Shadowrun, or Heroes of M&amp;M.   BTW, if you really are interested in the story of VC, but don't want to go through the whole game following guides, I would recommend you to watch the animate version of Valkyria Chronicle. It has 25+1 episodes that basically follow the plotline in game with some minor variation and additional stories.  ps: as a Japanese speaker, I must say the translation of English subtitles are horrible, although they somewhat make senses by themselves, the meanings are often way off the original voice casts. ex: Selvaria is a Colonel, never a Brigade General, and she was almost always being addressed as 'Daisa'(romanji pronunciation for Colonel in jpn) by her comrades and soldiers instead of her name."
" Pros:  + Anime JRPG with cute art style. + Timeless great story (with a childish perspective, so everyone should get the messages). + Nice voice acting and music. + Lot's of upgrades and options. + Characters that you should care for.  + Hard, i.e. live, die and repeat.   Cons:  - Pray to the RNG god.  - Save / Load game simulator. - Clunky Console GUI with too many useless sub windows. - Movement system for tanks is horrible. - Too much trial and error, because you don't get the informations needed before.   Verdict:  If you like games like X-Com and the anime art style. It's worth playing imho."
"I will warm Marina's cold, cold heart."
Game no longer launches for me. Unknown reason. I can make it into the formatting screen but no further. Played thru the prologue and I really liked the game which is a shame as I no longer can play it.
"Start VC Damn this is some good quality anime Damn this is some good taktikool gameplay O ♥♥♥♥ now im a tank commander Lets see, who'll be in my squad Jann Walker? ..!! Jann Walker X Largo forever  10/10 would decimate every super weapon thrown into the battlefield with a very flamboyant man with a pointy explodey stick"
"So far so good. Alicia is so pretty. This game feels like a a movie plot where nobody is wrong and it focuses on all the little things that make the bigger picture.    The characters are very relatable to anyone and are very unique. Also, the characters are justified for every action they took, even the bad ones. It also follows the concept of when it comes to defending the homeland anybody can fight. The battles are a bit difficult early on, but after all the right upgrades it's a walk in the park. It also points out to how heroes and villains are created out of the ordinary and how even the littlest of beings can make a change and how simplest of actions can make or break someones life. I felt bad for Selvaria and Maxi, they were both highly misunderstood. Story might say how a squad defeated an entire army, but it's really the Alicia Rosie show here. Got to love the ladies in skirts dodging wave after wave of bullets and cannon balls.   Stories within a story, feeling within feelings and that God dammed Lion's paw ring. This is a must have game for all strategy/RPG fans. If this were a movie it would beat pearl Harbour easy."
"I only played for half an hour, so take this as you will, but 90% of that half hour was spent saying 'OH MY GOD, GET ON WITH IT!'   I love the water color art style. The opening scenes (and reviews) tell me this game will be very deep, emotional, and satisfying. Unfortunatly the combat is PAINFULLY slow. KotOR did a very similar turn-based system, the difference, it was fun. I find myself laying out troops, and the going away for awhile to wait for the endless cutscene to end. That, and each combat session is divided by 3-7 'scenes' each about a minut long, and requiring you to select, and play each one. It's like 'quick time event' - the game.  If you are patient, I will reccomend this game. I know it will be worth it, but I cant sit around waiting for paint to dry. I don't expect it to be 'double action' by any means, but this is just too much. Guess I'll have to make due with a 'game movie' compilation.  Sadly, I cannot reccomend this game."

"If you love Tactical Turn Based GO FOR IT, visuals are still good dispite the age of the game. It's hard of course but you need to learn what unit does what before attacking   (specially a tank becasue a lot of people get stuck on the 4 or 5th mission)"
This game is basically an XCOM game with anime style. Need I say more?
"Okay first of all this game is awesome the gameplay may seem pretty stupid, but it makes it feel more stragetic (if that's the right word to use.)  Pros: •Play as different people •Stragety Required •Good for people who love to take turns in battles •Anime styled game (my faviroute) •&lt;----Bullet point&lt;----- •Good story in a way •Beatiful characters  •Probably a love story •Decent graphics for a port  Cons: •Buggy NPC's shooting at walls •No character customisation menu •Not open world •I can't find much cons cuz I am kind of possitive today       •-• portato •-• (Cuz it's a port)"

"I still do not understand the reason Steam cannot transfer playtime over from offline mode, but I would like to mention my playtime has been over 80 hours for three good reasons: combat with that slick free roaming tactical shooting, storyline with a rich retelling of a scenario we played a thousand times before (even if the anime-shojo stereotypes in this game make me want to punch a wall) and the endless replayability of the core structure.   I will say this game is not perfect though. The menus are annoying to navigate, the game chugs massively at random spurts of time during key moments of outflanking or outrunning, the tactical approach can be laughable if you consider taking all of your turns with one character to clear a field out (though in reflection the same could be said with the enemy luckily rolling a 20 and having the same chance once ever blue moon) and the length can be on the short side depending on your measure of a long game.  Some other points I did like to put toward the games favor is the voice-acting and the amazing visual appeal.   Some other points directly against it, however, is the dialog (depending on if anime is your thing).  Honestly though, this game is a time-absorber. I spent 20 hours playing before realizing the new day approached. Get this game because you wont see anything like it before or for a long time in the future. At least until they get smart and release the second (ARRRGH ANIME SUCKS!) and third one (WHY CANT ANIME BE LIKE THIS GOLDEN GEM!)"
"Please port 2 &amp; 3 to PC.  Please, I'm on my knees begging here."
"I actually really disliked this game. I was hoping for some good tactical combat, but what it turns out to be is 'Try to end your turn with as many allies in good positions as possible' so you can shoot them while they're taking their turns. Not so you can shoot them on your turn.   When you're moving a character, the entire enemy army can shoot at you. While you can move one person. When they're moving, whoever's turn it is gets shot by everyone in your army that can see them.   This led to me dying instantly to 5 enemies and a tank for trying to move 3 inches, and multiple enemies killing themselves running across my field of vision.  I know this game has some great reviews, and maybe when you can work around this system it's not so annoying. But this absolutely ruins the game for me. I can easily see this game being 'Try to have the shortest turns possible so they cant mow you down while you move' and just trying to have my army sit in good spots and ending my turn over and over until the enemy kills themselves."

Fantastic game + the art is nice and is done in a style that ages well + combat feels more fluid than outher turn baised games such as x-com + deep story + great charictors all voiced with backstorys + a long main story with countless optional scenarios and side missions + good controls (i'm playing with xbox controler) + challenging tactical gameplay + chose your squad for each mission and swap out members depending on there stregnths and waeknesses (some members are raceist towards darciens for example and get a penalty for bieng neer them) (or some members like bieng neer friends and gain a bonus) these and may more stats make putting together your squad an interesting task rather than throwing random people together.  - some of the explanations for combat took a bit to long to pop up (eg: i shot the generator o the tank for several turns before the explanation poped up to explain what it was)
Made me cry it was so good... One of the best tactics games ever made. ever.
"This games focused more on the storyline than anything else, so if you are a person who can't stand cutscenes, I would NOT reccomend you to buy this game.  Overall, this game was an enjoyable and challenging experience. The storyline was good and the combat system was rather enjoyable. Some rounds can take pretty long but not boring. Getting all As can be quite challenging but I still enjoyed nonetheless. Great game !"
Got to the point where some guy started taking to salmon and realized that maybe this game was not for me.
Its like Saving Private Ryan but without the PTSD.  NoFun/10

Awesome gameplay!
One of the best JRPG ever made
"One of my all time favourite SEGA games. Great art style, fun story, and most importantly great gameplay, a great combination between a Turn Based strategy and a third person shooter."
"Bought this game on sale 75% on Gamersgate. I feel bad for it, i should have pay it, full price. This game is a piece of art. Combines excellent art design, gameplay, Rpg elements. I fell in love with this game. Never heard of it. Pity.  In short : This game have the chemistry of the movie 'Brother in amrs', the gameplay of Xcom and the research of Metal Gear Solid PEACE WALKER.  All 3 games combined and it´s perfect. And like xcom, has permanent death of your comarades in arms. You will get attached to your friends.  10/10  Update: After finishing the game, there is a new game plus. This adds tons of things that adds more replay value. PS: Take note Bioware ( Mass Effect 3 ), this is how you make an epic ending... My God, this game is so sweet"
Great turn based RPG game..
"This is game is based on plot. So if you dont like anime and other stuff buy but know this is reading-game. For anime lovers 9/10  +Great plot, a lot of reading 2/3 of game, good tactical gameplay, more informations and history anout VG universe, characters from anime, you can change if you dont want team from anime, funny reactions for characters, fully customizable weaponry - not synchronised with anime (there is a lot of scenes from anime but the most interesting are passed), tank driving-_-,Rambo tactic ( evade, caution, defense boost + Alicia(have fun)) For gameplayers 6/10 -a lot of boring reading ( i like it but someone prefer play than read:D), short mission if you are good at strategy(1- 20 turns), tank driving-_-, Rambo tactic ( evade, caution, defense boost + Alicia(have fun)) + good battle engine, easy for newbs and hard for badasses, good strategy, funny reactions for characters, fully customizable weaponry * I played more and I think I should correct my review. So I change something. Changed:Short, low tactical maps This game can be really LONG, there are 1-2 maps at epizode."
All you need is noce.
"Decent story and solid battle system, but I can't recommend the game. The AI is pretty awful, but the glaring issue with the game is the exceedingly long battles. Losing a battle means restarting that encounter, and it's pretty easy to lose some of these battles. While you can save during a battle, you're typically going to lose due to some change in the battle that was entirely beyond prediction (sudden army appearing, lead by an invincible killing machine).   The first point where the game feels unfair is a desert battle where you're tasked with killing a massive tank. The game doesn't feed you any hints until after some of the battle has progressed. If you're lucky, you might have units in the right positions to do something to stop this thing. Honestly, the game was good until this point. The following missions kind of follow this sort of theme. You're just outgunned, waiting to get beaten up because you picked the wrong team... or because the enemy snipers can pick you off through smoke.   The collision detection in the game can be pretty awful too. This is both a problem for moving and attacking.  I don't dislike the game, but I can't recommend it."

"I love this game! Great characters, great story, great music, great gameplay, great graphics (you have to get used to the japanes anime style though), great cutscenes (there are a lot). Even the fact, that its actually a war game, does not lessen the fun I had playing. It's just that there are always moments of reflection about what war means to people and why it sometimes might be nessecary to fight nevertheless.  Although it is a great port I recommend playing with XBox-Controller."

"Welp, I did not expect to like this game as much as I did. I don't get it, you know? I can barely run it at 800x600 fullscreen resolution, and the animations get all weird and that, I don't even like the two main characters. Just like magic, I started playing this game a not so long ago, and have been coming back every once in while, it never stops. I just keep coming back.  I don't know guys, I think this might be one of my favorite games of all time, right up there with the likes of Dark Souls and WC3. Also, I know this review isn't really helpful as in recommending the game kinda helpful, but that's because I can't explain yet how good this game is. I swear, once I learn how to express myself on Valkyria Chronicles, I'll come back and update this review. For the time being, just look at the thumbs up on top of me, that pretty much sums it all up."
"It's like Band of Brothers if nazis were pure evil and none of the good guys EVER died. Plus, there's a main character type guy that absolutely drowns in women even though he's completely on the spectrum. Even his own sister wants him inside. **Jezus christ, Japan**  Japanese writing is pretty terrible. But the game is fun, slow though. 7.5/10  Edit: No autosaving has ♥♥♥♥ed me over 5 times so far. I sure do enjoy spending 30 minutes x 5 on the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mission each ♥♥♥♥ing time. Why is there no autosaving? ♥♥♥♥ing japanese ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, if the story is bad atleast make the game functional."
"This game is ultimately a good game. Well made, challenging and with entertaining gameplay. The storyline is standard fair for Japanese RPGs; entertaining, but it won't make you think or feel.  But the tone of this game is so ♥♥♥♥ing absurd. It shifts from Japanese-y cutesy waifu fair, to an allegory for early 20th century Jewish treatment in Europe (and the world, on the broader scale), back to cutesy waifu treatment with a beach episode...  Straight to an alternate world's interpretation of real-life concentration camps.  Normally I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about these sort of things, but this game just doesn't show Jewish WWII-era treatment the respect it deserves; a half-♥♥♥♥♥, simplified allegory for their treatment in between the story of some weird unit of soldiers that feel considerably more like students at a High School.   All that being said I would still recommend this game if you have a love of SRPGs and are looking for something that takes a very different spin on the genre."
A good port of the PS3 classic. One of my favourite games ever.
"Masterpiece, i'm not a big RPG players, but this one was the most enjoyable i ever played, an eye candy and a really enjoyable scenario. Give the sequels plz !!!!!!"
+1
Not bad!! not bad indeed. Its based on your thinking skill! and its anime like so if you like anime this game worth to try!
Amazing Pc port for amazing game. If you have ever played this game and liked it I would consider it worth buying.
Very great game
2 min into this game im already dead. 10/10 this game is too tough for me.
It's ok.
Is it overrated? You better believe it. As of 2015 this clunky playstation port had a difficult translation from japanese to english and it took all of eight years just to make it as far as it has. First time I played it was not even on steam- it was an emulator torrent piratted from the web.   You could easilly count everything I just said as a black mark against this game... but then you would have to wonder why so many people would go through the trouble.
"why are you reading reviews? just look at the overwhelming postive responses, look at the screenshots and if you arent turned off yet buy the game already! (its just that great, only things i didnt like was; its not that forgiving and that scene after chapter 12 or so.......thats enough spoilers i think)"
5 cups of open ended turn based strategy 3 tablespoons of third person shooter action goodness 2 dashes of JRPG customization and 5 pounds of awesome storytelling with a buncha lovable characters!  Mix it all together to get the goodness of an epic anime inspired story with some of the best and most fun gameplay i've had all year!!`~  ...Why haven't you bought this game yet???!! &gt;:O
"Amazing semi-turn-based strategy game with anime aesthetic. The gameplay is very fun even if you don't appreciate the anime style. Valkyria Chronicles is set in an alternative universe World War 2 with fantasy elements, and if that isn't awesome I don't know what is."
It's a very good game! I would reccomend it to all anime fans or people who likes this type of gameplay. Watched the anime but this game's better.
woah when did I become a weeaboo??? its a good game! i like it
 I think this is the beginning of a beautiful love-hate. 
Turn ending simulator.
"A great story! And the gameplay is really fun! I happened to install the game and then became completely into it (couldn't wait to play it through), totally enjoying it all the time!"
Amazing graphics and storytelling Everysingle frame is just like a painting - thanks to CANVAS  Even if you're not a big fan of Anime - this is still a great game and Id highly recommend to check it out.  
GREAT GAME !!!  Fantastic Story 10/10 Gameplay 9/10 Graphics 8/10 Music 7/10  OVERALL: 8.5  RECOMMENDED
Greatest game Sega ever made. this game has it all. My most recomended game on steam.
u know what there's no much i can say to this game CUZ it's awesome!!!  go buy it u wont regret it
"one of the best rpg games i've ever played  Set in 1930s in the midst between the Gallian war and the Empire, a small neutral town called Bruhl gets taken. Here we are introduced the memorable characters of Alicia and Welkin Gunther and the start of a small tiny front facing a giant military might  CHARACTERS: 10/10 All of the characters in this game are very memorable, with actual noticeable growth over time. You can't help but feel invested into each character as they each have their own unique story before joining Squad 7. For instance, Rosie, the hotshot, learns the harsh realities of war and starts to slowly belate her prejudice against the hated Darcsens. Or Welkin, the main character, learns to translate his scientific curiosity into actual leadership, staking his reputation on the line in order to win his comrade's trust and loyalty  What's great about the character development as well is it is not completely one sided. You learn about the opposing army's side with little snippets of dialog and can actually relate to what and why they are fighting the war. Some fight for power, some for their country, some for loyalty to others. War in itself brings about the worst and best of people, and this game as silly as it sounds potrays this very well  STORY: 10/10 Following character development, the story is actually what'd you'd seem as realistic fiction. Everything in the story seems plausible and almost every plot pitfall is actually considered. I won't go into details here as it would be a spoiler  Each and every decisive victory over the battlefield for your squad feels like a step in victory towards winning the war. Plot twist and turns are evident, and the story feels like a living breathing thing, changing based upon the victories your squad makes. Your squads reputation becomes well known, and you start fighting a long line of battles to achieve strategic advantages. Even when the battle seems impossible, your squad always finds a solution around it, even during battle.  The story has so many great plot lines going for it : war torn themes, love, betrayal, hatred, ethics, etc. If you had to compare this story plot to an actual book plot, it would be like mixing Harry Potter and 'All Quiet on the Western Front' wrapped up in one game.  GRAPHICS 9/10 PC port was pretty good, it didn't match that well for 1960x1080p resolution. Sometimes it was hard to see the enemy at a far away distance because of how pixelated it looked, but it didn't matter since there was a line of sight on your character anyhow   ART AND MUSIC: 10/10 Music in itself can really change how an audience feels about a game, or a movie. The music is spot on protraying the tragedies of war, and the hyped up tension of a firefight.  Art in itself is very anime japanese-style, its not everyone's cup of tea but I enjoyed it.  GAMEPLAY 10/10 Gameplay reminds me of XCOM but with a classic artist style look and appeal, with a mix of Fallout VATS system. There's actually a good deal of strategy when it comes to positioning your units, and the game progressively gets more difficult as the game goes on  There were some bull**** moments though, nearing the mid point of the game when you fight off a super large tank.  It felt like the enemy was cheating in every sense of the way at that point. However, the game does get a little easier imo as the game goes on, especially when you level up your classes and get better weapons.  Sometimes its too easy to cheat through the game by reloading your save to get the best possible outcome / chance of making all your shots hit. It does get challenging trying to achieve an A+ rank on a mission in the fewest moves possible, and makes you think about what the most efficient pathing is  Enemy AI can be kind of stupid sometimes, which makes the game easier than it is. Enemies could easily flank your main character and win if they wanted too  FINAL THOUGHTS:  This game will be a timeless classic that I will probably play again a couple of years from now There's a second and third game but I don't think I will be playing it anytime soon  Average gameplay time = 30 hours"
My team of waifus completely obliterates the enemy forces with pure moe.

"Good story, gameplay and interesting characters."
10/10 would cry again
"Beautiful game with a unique engine and graphics. Very fun and challenging. Glad to see this on PC and PS4, with *much* faster loads :P"
"XCOM: Anime Unknown.  Absolutely stunning graphics. Solid turn-based strategy gameplay with a touch of real-time action (enemy soldiers shoot at you while you move around) so you're not just spending 3 hours making your perfect Sun Tzu maneuver just right. We're in a war, man! Ain't no time for stupid questions!!  A really great game in pretty much every way. Don't let the anime turn you off, it's not as cringe-inducing as most anime things."
"I had this on PS3 ages ago but never finished it so I bought it on sale here just to complete it. Its a really good game if you like turn based combat, a lot of strategy and story telling. There were a couple of times I felt I saw more cutscenes than play myself but the story is pretty good. It start out as your typical anime but ends with a big battle with lots of lights, sparcles and crazy stuff like every anime. Glad I bought this again."
"I know, I know I've let you down I've been a fool to myself I thought that I could live for no one else  But now through all the hurt and pain Its time for me to respect the ones you love mean more than anything.  So with sadness in my heart I feel the best thing I could do is end it all and leave forever whats done is done, it feels so bad what once was happy now is sad I'll never love again my world is ending  I wish that I could turn back time 'cause now the guilt is all mine can't live without the trust from those you love. I know we can't forget the past you can't forget love and pride because of that it's killing me inside  It all returns to nothing, it all comes tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down, it all returns to nothing, I just keep letting me down, letting me down, letting me down, in my heart of hearts, I know that I could never love again I've lost everything everything, everything that matters to me, matters in this world  I wish that I could turn back time 'cause now all the guilt is mine can't live without the trust from those you love I know we can't forget the past we can't forget love and pride because of that, its killing me inside  It all returns to nothing, it all comes tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down it all returns to nothing, I just keep letting me down, letting me down, letting me down It all returns to nothing, it all comes tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down it all returns to nothing, I just keep letting me down, letting me down, letting me down  I wanna kill myself"
"Enjoyable turn-based squad strategy with action elements. The anime story and aesthetic isn't to my taste, but I enjoyed the gameplay and strategy regardless.  Worth the time."
Anime WW2 with magical girls and Korean Jews Surprisingly a lot better than that sounds
"This game is not hard to play but hard to feel. Very feeling, deep, and a perfect happy ending. Why not try now?"
Anime with guns
maybe its cause I played it with my keyboard but the controls are just terrible I cannot tell you how often I died due to the caracter on screen running to wrong way or missing too much. I loved the art and the story work they put into thie TOTALY NOT WWII SIM. this could ahve been very fun but really was very frustrating reminded me of loosing an xcom character and the rage that induces
"Its world war 2 with anime, What more do you need?"

"Ok, this is your chance, he is literally 2 meters in front of you, you have a marksman rifle, you can't in any way, shape or form miss this.  *Misses*  *Dies after*  10/10"
"This game is so incredibly good. Great action, fantastic story. Can't recommend it enough."
"If you enjoy X-COM, you will probably like this turn based strategy game. The story starts slow and requires some patience in the learning phase like many games. As the story progress, you quickly appreciate the strength of various soldier class, the importance of positioning, the differences in making use of environment.  Coupled of growing challenging scenarios, the story is quite touching (though Dialouge is a bit lengthy). Most map have some variations / twist on its own, and you won't feel like 'Äww, its the same map like previous..'.  Summary:  - Well Balanced Game Play, game difficulty goes up as you level. Excellent for games who like challenges to their tactical mind  - Players are free to spend their experience on any class and level according to their game play style (Sniper, Assault, Scout, Anti-Tanks)  - Skirmish mission &amp; story mode available. Experience from Skirmish mission can be brought into story!  - High-replayability. Didnt get Rank A for the map ? Play it when you complete the game. Try the Skirmish difficulty challenges to test your deployment skills!   This game is a must have for Strategy game lovers."

"Its world war 2 with anime, What more do you need?"
"This is The hardest JRPG SRPG I EVER PLAY Why i said this. there are the reason why but first i might list out prow and cons about this game  PRO 1) nice water color art even though this game is 8 years old 2) Nice story and it's like im reading a story book  CON 1) game lock at 30 fps 2) max ressolution is 1080p 3) enemy are imbalance,they can pawn you in early game 4) Selvaria more like a final boss on chapter 7 and 14 than maxximillian 5) you need to calculate your move correctly in order to clear this game. you cannot take this game light hearted 6) A lOT of mechanism in this game will kill you and you have to retry a dozen time. 7) Gameplay are so dull and Slow, it's like playing Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunter on ps vita. 8) Final boss suck, you can clear the game in one turn. 9) You need to always View your squard traits in order to know which campaing is right for them. 10) Isara's Death 11) Chapter 7 is a hard clear due to sylvaria's valkyrie blood active. i try like 10 times and it's freaking long.  and here are my conclusion for this game. i really love the story every moment until the end but the ending of this game really is not too satisfy for me. But hey At least alicia and welkins are together now and with a daughter name ISARA. not to con fuse with the isara that passed away on chapter 11. Should i recommend this game, umm if you are really a JRPG/SRPG fan off course.....but i recommend get this game on sale if you can. It's also rereleased on ps4 not long ago too but i recommend get it on pc though, you get the same experience you get on ps4 and cheaper too...unless you want the artbook that came with ps4 game for europe version. Anyway you can search the youtube about this game b4 you buy it. for me is a nice game to own that needs brainstorming to cleared the game.  i would recommend the game although cons really outdue the pros."
"A very fun Turn-Based Strategy game set in a steam-punk time period where everything is run by something called Ragnite, a powerful substance used for healing and running powerful machines such as tanks and trains. The turn-based combat is somewhat unique by having a overwatch-style kind of set up, only as the enemy approches you continue to fire on them which can make certain situations difficult unless you plot your course carefully and your positions well.  You also get to unlock new equipment and improve the different equipment you currently have for extra damage, accuracy and so on to over-power the enemy imperial troops. The story is also very interesting about the history and the mythical 'Valkyur' who were powerful god-like beings powered by Ragnite. Every mission will test you differently in your skill and how to use each different troop in combat."
"I was not all that impressed with this game. The first impression was good. The artstyle is lovely, the story was entertaining enough and at first glance the combat seems fun. But i found myself losing interest in the game quite fast.  Lets start with the story. The story so far has been interesting and the characters have been nice enough. Each character has a distinct look which is lovely and it great that this is also true for all of the characters in the squad. The story and the characters are certainly animehhhhh which might turn some people off but i have no problem with. They way they jump from being serious to lighthearted can sometimes be a bit odd but there is a certain charm to that in some way.  But my problem with the story is just how cutsceny the whole game feels. Every chapter is filled with cutscenes and there is also a ton of downtime in the actually missions. So far all of these cutscenes have contained no interactivity at all and there is just so much of it that the game feels more like a movie with some interactive parts than a game with some movie parts.   I did not personally enjoy this and i would have prefered if they either made the story more interactable or allowed me to move around in the base as a character and actually feel like a character instead of simply dropping a bunch of movies on me through the interface. But this is very much a personal preference.  The interface is by the way obviously designed for a controller even though it works alright with mouse and keyboard.  But the combat sections of the game is where i think that the game dropped the ball. There is some strange stuff in the combat that becomes very obvious very quickly. The hitboxes for stuff in the environment are often larger than the visual representation which is extremely annoying in a game where every attack matters.   The game is also full of invisible walls for your characters movement. At best this is simply annoying when it leads to you wasting movement points but it also forces you to go exatly where the developers wanted you to go. In practice this means that you can't go a couple of meters in the forest next to you to get a clear shot or to flank your enemies and i think that this is a very odd design choice for a game that is supposed to be tactical.  But there are just a bunch of stuff in the combat that does not makes sense. Crouching behind cover means that you get a defense bonus and immunity to vital shots. Ok fine, but these bonuses are still in effect when the attacker is at the same side of the cover which leads to certain units being able to take a silly amount of shots from an attacker which stands just beside them.  Some people might just accept this and see it as another rule in the rulebook that they need to take into consideration in combat. But the way is see it is that the rules should fit to the gameplay and the visual representation and this rule does not fit into what i think should happen if the player flanks and shoots an enemy behind cover in the third person perspective.  The AI is also quite weird and it often throws away a large part of its turn doing nothing. Which is fortunate in a way since it otherwise could quite easily screw you over. The way units return fire when its not their turn is very odd and the computer could really screw the player over if it actually just stayed behind and focused on a single unit.  In the end i just found myself forcing myself to play another chapter every evening and that is not a good sign. I can see how some people might really be into this game but it was not for me.   "
"As someone who is a big fan of Fire Emblem games and also enjoyed playing X-COM, I was hoping this game would be an excellent fit for me. Unfortunately Valkyria Chronicles is a game that comes very close to being good, but stumbles at pretty much every opportunity. The game has a weird crouch mechanic that makes headshots ineffective. Bullets farther then a few yards out are often ineffective and anti-tank guns are underpowered and very inaccurate. This means that the easiest way to win is buffing scouts with commands and rushing. The game suggests that this is the best way to play and gives low grades on any mission where you didn't rush like a banshee. This could be forgiven if any other units/strategies came remotely close to being as good as this one.  The level design isn't too bad, but a few feel a little cheap, and one with infinitely respawning enemies is decidedly awful. The story on the other hand is full of values dissonance and Mary Sue characters. I'm impressed that they tried to work key themes into a greater overall narritive, but they come off heavy handed and the sacrifices of many of the characters make no sense in the context of the story.  Valkyria Chronicles tried to do something different, and I have to commend the effort. With a couple of changes, it could be a great game, but as it stands, it sort of hits a gaming uncanny valley where everything feels off. As a fan of strategy games, I'm glad the game was successful and that there is still a following for such games. However, I would be hard pressed to recommend it to anyone."
"Squad 7, move out!"
"There are few words which can describe this game, i thought about it and i got it, World War Waifu. TL;DR: If you are into anime interpretations of things and a fan of turn based strategy such as X-com, hogs of war etc, give it a try but if playing a ww2 anime with none of the seriousness makes you sick, pass. Gameplay core is ok but game throws new rules at you at every mission.   Story:Now lets get the good ones out of the way, good story, i will give you that. Twists and turns are interesting and are somewhat hard to guess so it gets a point from there but at some point you get sick of the amount of the amount of superweapons that the Empire has, at some point it makes you think, do our R&amp;D dept. is sitting twigling their thumbs for years while they build stuff that makes you go, its horribly impractical but i want that. On the name, yes you see you will be surprised how many attractive anime girls and sometimes people that makes you go ' WHAT ARE YOU?!' Though it is quite flavorful, the main thing it adds to the genre is cute anime girls, which is a welcome addition to almost anything  Presentation : Graphics are nicely styled and game length is decent it took me about 19 hours to finish main story at least according to my save, i might have gone afk for some time but i felt like the game was really long enough. Music, voice acting etc, were exemplary it never broke immersion, whatever broke it was in the gameplay which brings us toooo  Gameplay: BY GOD, HOW CAN YOU RUIN IT SO BADLY, here is the thing, in game design, you need to have rules and variation to those to keep things interesting, which is nice but in almost every mission that comes to mind , the rules change so much that you need a walkthrough for example, most missions involve the variations of, go here and capture these camps, which is nice but then you start encountering the kind of units you are not prepared for such as artillery which can 1 shot most of your men and you have no idea, sometimes taking cover uses too much walking points sometimes it doesn't the units level up and change so fast that you have no way of predicting their range unless you replay the mission. All of these complaints come from 2 things, game constantly throwing in new things and the core game mechanics of, when you aim stop getting fired at which completely breaks all semblence of immersion. The other big one is the Orders, in this game you can give orders that use command points which are used to play your units but you never know if that order is useless or overpowered until you use it, it only says it increases defence but by how much? You dont know until you try it.   As such in my opinion as someone who casually watches anime and loves strategy games, this is too much anime too little strategy. If your idea of strategy is replaying missions for 1-3 times ( iplayed final mission 3 times before i beat it ) then go ahead but the whole cutesy atmosphere and cliche characters as well as constantly unfair conditions ( you fight dozens of enemies on average which is fun for the most part). This game is simply not for most western gamers in my opinion but as i said, for me i am torn betwee recommending and not recommending it and went with no but barely."
"Horrible game design. The only way to get a good rating is finishing the mission as fast as possible even if that means you only use scouts, run past all enemies to capture the flag at the camp. It completely ruins any attempt at tactical play that's possible in the game."
"I wanted to like it.  Clunky, unresponsive interface. Anemic story with so many cut sceens it might as well be a coma inducing 'movie'. EVERYTHING about the control of charaters is akward, slopy and frustrating. The enemy can shoot the head off a match at 100yrds, while your charaters cant hit the broad side of a barn at 5yrds. Forget attempting anything like real tactics, run in guns blazing and hope your luck holds.   If you are one of those people who have good luck with games of chance, this might be an ok game for you. Otherwise, its like beating your head against a wall until your luck pays off. Not my idea of fun..."
"I liked this game at the begining, but at the end I was raging all over the place, and why? BECAUSE THAT GOD DAMN TANK.  The game isn't actually bad, story's fine and visual's fine, while dub a little weak in some cases, not much of a problem. Battles are fun at start too. But game has 1 big problem - it's being glichy, buggy, when it comes to the tank control. (sometimes I didn't like how battle system was unpredictable as well, killing their 'leader unit' didn't decrease enemy's command points and AI was most of the time very weak.) But controlling that god damn tank was nightmare. there were moments when a few turns in, while a step ahead of victory, with 2 command points remaining, you try to position your tank so they can't aim weak points. Well guess what, I suddenly wants to dance! Do a 720 noscope! It got me to the point of 'savining every time before I start tank and after I manage to get a it in position.' It ruins whole experiance, you don't care about story or battle or anything at all, you're just angry it randomly decides to ♥♥♥♥ you up from time to time. I wanted 0 death clear, but I was so damn annoyed in the end, I just let marmotta kill a few guys. I simply couldn't care about game anymore, I just wanted to clear it. Yea.... negative from me."
"When I first played this game I was blown away by the design, graphics and interesting story elements that you don't typically see in a strategy game as this. However the more I played the more I began to dislike this game.   The over all issue is there really is no sense of strategy to this 'strategy' game. Oh yes, there are instances where you can go an try to scout an area, set up snipers on roof tops and what not, but the game does punish you for it. All battles are ranked based on how many turns you take to complete a mission which consist of mainly of capture a certain check point (capture the flag style), defending an area, or eleminating certain foes. The more turns you take, the more you recieve a poor ranking. Thus most 'strategy' is just to run and gun foes down until you get to your objective.   Further, you are basically going to spending the majority of your time level grinding.  In all it is a shame that I was disappointed. I was hooked by the different classes of troops, a very interesting story element that would play out (despite it being your typical anime wifu element), and good graphic design. If you do want to purchase this, I would recommend doing it when it is on sale or for finding it cheaper from another store."
"Overwrote my save with DLC save, ♥♥♥♥."
"At the start this game was very entertaining, enjoyed how combat worked, how moving troops around would bring you down from an overlay of the battlefield to a thirdperson of the unit you're moving. As I progressed however some of the features in this game slowly made me get very agitated with it.  One thing that annoyed me a lot was when flanking a covered unit, they still get the cover bonus even when you are shooting them in the back, requiring the player to somehow destroy the cover or knock the enemy away from the cover before being able to properly damage them.  What made me stop playing the game however was how the enemy could attack you when you are moving your character, while I understand this is a feature of the game and that your units can do the same to the enemy unit, unless you are able to flank, your units will never be able to attack the enemy without getting shot at a couple of times, often causing status effects like lowered defenses or lowered attack damage. Because of this you have to be very fast with your controls to move a unit into position, target the enemy and end your turn because every second wasted is a second your unit is getting shot at. This wouldn't be a huge problem if the same could be applied to the units you controlled, that if the enemy got within your unit's range they would fire back, instead your units require the enemy to get incrediebly close to you and even then they will only get to fire off a couple of shots, unlike the full magazines the opponent will do when you're moving your troops.  There are so many other things wrong with this game and this review is already bloated as it is, it felt good at the start and I really looked forward to playing this game to the end, but with such a huge disadvantage it just ruins the game."
"First of all, the writing.  This is a game approaching heavy themes. It's WW2. A red army sweeping across definitely not Europe. Nationalistic, donning regal military uniforms, proclaiming the power of their race. The 'United western allies', trying to stop them. The Darcsens are pretty much the Jewish people, even shown enslaved in labour camps. It approaches these heavy themes like a generic jrpg. To the point where you're not far off to imagine this game as Tidus and Yuna on an adventure to stop Hitler. That'd be a better game, summoning Ifrit in Kransberg Castle.  It doesn't handle the weight of these themes well at all. Characters will talk glumly about enslavement or the horrors of war, then rattle off trite lines about working together. You can maybe accept it all if you think of it as trying to present a heavy topic to a young audience, while still being entertaining. But I don't even think it does that well... If you're the type to play a lot of jrpg's. If you enjoy 'the tomboy', 'the leader', 'the gruff male'. Androgynous youth hamming it up. If that's your ♥♥♥♥, you'll enjoy this. But maybe you won't, because normally it's set in fantasy land, with magic and monsters. Here your plucky characters are facing machine gun fire. Although the way everybody acts you'd think they were at disney land.  There is a gay 'lancer' who's a treat though, pure quality.  Now the actual game. It's difficult playing this after the rebirth of xcom and with all the fantastic strategy going around right now. VC is a poorly designed strategy game. The main reward system focues on turns taken. Look up how to ace any map and it will involve buffing a character with 'orders' and having them make a sprint to the finish. There's nothing incentivising slow play. The maps are laid out in such away you'll likely progress simply leap frogging two characters across a laid out path, running right up to people and headshotting them as quickly as possible. Maybe you need a grenade now and again. Moving up your entire squad, positioning them in cover, flanking and doing what you'd expect, feels awful in this game. You quickly stop doing it. It never makes any sense to play so slowly. The game doesn't even use the interesting ideas it seems built around. Characters 'like' each other, and get boosts if they're near each other. Good luck noticing when this ever has an impact. Don't spend a long time in the barracks trying to match them up. It's a waste of time. Characters also have unique boosts depending on their surroundings or situation. One character might get a vision boost at night with the perk 'Nocturnal'. The problem with this mechanic is that these perks happen at random. They're dice rolls that might win you a game, but you can't repeat them. You can't build a strategy around them. Lots of the maps are gimmicks. You quickly realize, 'oh, this is what the designer wants, guess I'll do that then'. It's less a strategy game and more of a puzzler. And that goes against the very mechanics of the game. Missing a shot when you're trying to finish a round in 6 turns isn't fun. You don't care about stats or percentages when everything comes down to, 'will it take two moves or one to kill this guy'. The situations where character bonuses will make this difference are so rare and unlikely that you never think about them. It's a mess.  It does look very lovely though."
"I really want to like this game, but alas, I don't. First the good - love the art style, enjoy the story, decent game mechanics. So why don't I like the game? Well, unfortunately this is one of those games where it is  'Let me try this. Nope failed the mission. Relaod. Try again, nope, reload. That seemed to be a good strategy but my attack missed and the couter attack killed a critical character, so failed. Reload. Wow, this level was going so well and then some unexpected cutscene happened and after it all went downhill. Reload.'  If that kind of gameplay doesn't bug you then great, get the game it is worth it. But it bugs the crap out of me. As I said the story line is good but I play a bit, get frustrated, stop playing for a few months, come back to it, and forget the current storyline..."
"I've tried beating this game twice (once on PS3 and again now) and just can't get through it. Somewhere after Chapter 9 or 10, the missions take way too long, and often result in a random enemy spawning or event taking place that you didn't expect. At which point, you lose a ton of troops and any chance of achieving an A rank. Considering you usually fail the mission when that happens, you are forced to restart from the very beginning and try again, which means dedicated another 45 minutes.  I loved the anime twist on World War 2, but that's the game's only draw for me. The controls are clunky, especially on PC. The tank moves every which way, and when it doesn't respond properly, it's still burning it's moving points, which causes you to miss out on the proper positioning.  If mission times were shorter, 20 minutes or 30 minutes max, the game wouldn't be such a slog to get through. Unless you are some kind of turn-based strategy, X-COM sicophant, don't bother."
"hard luck, hard luck, and HARD LUCK GAME.  if you don't feel like ur lucky, don't play this game. if you can't accept even if ur stretagy is perfect but lost because of accuracy, don't play this game.  this game is the only game that stressed, forced me to quit in chapter 7. P.S: edelweiss moving sucks, tumbling tank like proto-type early tanks, sometimes it seriously tumbles and eats moving point, but NOT actually moving."
"It looks promising at first, the PS2 level graphics can be excused for more the more important issue of gameplay.  Then comes the first warning sign. 20GB to install a PC port of a PS2 game? That's more than Skyrim needs, even with all the DLC and several content adding mods. That doesn't make any sense for a game that looks like this, even 2GB would be too much. It's a sign that the programmers just didn't care about doing things correctly. I'd actually prefer the other option, that they bloated the size on purpose just to troll everyone, because that wouldn't indicate that I spent money on a terrible port.  Then the part that I regret not looking into earlier. Made by SEGA. Anyone who has played a Sega game on PC knows that Sega has a habit of taking some great original games, and converting them into unplayable crap when it's time to port. This is no exception. It's as if Sega does not know what a keyboard and mouse are. Sega, in case you didn't know, keyboard and mouse are what PCs use. If you're going to make a PC game, make it work with those. This is almost as bad as trying to play that Sonic Team Racing game where the first level is literally impossible if you don't spend an extra $50-$60 on a special controller that you'll use for that game and that game only. I suppose it should be considered incredible that Sega actually allows WASD movement at all this time, without having to install keyboard macros in the background. It still doesn't change the fact that there is no 'walk' button, so no peeking out from behind corner, and gods forbid your tank runs into a wall and needs to turn in place; watch your movement meter get drained in a second with no real movement being made, forcing you to continue missions with infantry alone or waste turns trying to get unstuck as if you were an invisible mud pit. Controls aside, how about SKIPPABLE CUTSCENES. If you're going to include cheap surprise gimmicks 75% into a level that force restart after restart while the player tries to figure out how to win with no permanent casualties, don't force me to skip through the same poorly-voiced (In English at least) cutscenes over and over. Especially if following the advice of the in-game help is a great way to lose repeatedly. And even if you figure out the right tactics, the rest is up to an unfair RNG. Have fun trying to win when some of the recruits have '20% of doing nothing for no reason whatso♥♥♥♥ingever', your Snipers randomly miss your target whenever it's especially important for them to hit their target, and even your story-critical tank sometimes randomly decides to shoot the ground 7 ft in front of it, often missing targets no more than 20ft away. At least the soundtrack is still good. Apparently the parts that you can't ruin by hiring a random high school kid in their first programming class to do your port will turn out just fine. And I half expected them to convert all the music into 90's era low quality wav files just to waste more space and make my ears bleed.  Conclusion: This is the worst port of a game ever since the last time Sega ported a game."
"Visually, the game is great. That's about as far as greatness goes with this title. The combat is slow and very random at the beginning since you have to train your characters accuracy by purchasing better equipment, but even once it's maxed out you'll still find yourself missing impossible-to-miss shots. Which is a shame because at first glance the fps-style aiming for the combat seemed interesting, but it's rarely ever useful as you could just as simply select a target with an auto-aim and no target has more than 2 points to bother attacking. A more traditional target selecting system for this game may have made the dice-roll of accuracy a bit more palatable too since it doesn't wear the veneer of fps aiming mechanics. The most annoying flaw in this game was that you could play it with only half of the unit types, since some of them were so utterly useless. I completed the game using only 2 of 5 unit types for the majority of the game, only in special instances needing to include 1 of the other types for a specific target. Finally, the lack of movement options on the maps is very restricting of actual development of strategy as you will have at most 2 lanes of attack.  I came to this game because it was 'story rich' but that story is weak and juvenile, filled with simple characters and uninteresting plot elements. The enemy continues to escalate in power despite claims throughout that whatever you are up against is their ultimate weapon. Also, for a 'strategy' game, the strategy employed by the characters within makes little to no sense as you come into great power with little consequences to using it, but it is never used.   Disappointed."
"The tutorials run over everything except important details. For example: leaping over a sandbag and aiming your gun point blank into an enemy's head is the same as being on the oppposite side aiming at his head, the 'in cover' defensive bonus still applies! If your tank shell has the misfortune of hitting the leaf on a tree the shell explodes and knocks down the tree, wasting your firing turn.   Then there's the story. It's done in a typical anime aimed at a 14 year old style. No one seems disturbed or genuinely unhappy about this 'evil' empire invading their country. Be prepared for plenty of 'these guys are evil! Look! They're shooting civilians' lazy style of writing.   This isn't a good turn based strategy game."
"Great game, great story, fun gameplay, awesome artstyle and soundtrack. Good to see such a game coming to PC/Steam - I've got it for PS3 but decided to buy it on PC to support Japanese games on PC in hopes of more such releases in the future. Speaking of PS3, this game is a pretty much direct port from the PS3 game - but a well made one. If you'll play it with a gamepad you won't tell the difference apart from no waiting time while saving the game unlike on the PS3 where you'd have to wait several seconds each time. Playing it with mouse and keyboard works well too. "
"Eh, I've played worse, but it's still not particularly good.  Full disclosure- I didn't get past the 3rd battle, I've lost it like four times. But the real reason I stopped is that I just don't care enough to keep trying- It's not fun, it's not interesting, I just have utter apathy for this game.  The gameplay is alright, I guess. The core mechanics seem weird and aren't particularly interesting, at least not early on. It doesn't feel strategic or purposeful or like I'm planning out the means to victory, it just feels like I'm guessing and hoping to stumble on the chain of logic nessecary to beat a game I really don't care about.  Story is inoffensive, I guess. The characters and storytelling seem fine, just nothing particularly good either."

"Peter really hates this game, 10/10"
"I would like this game only if chapter 7 didnt exist, it takes this relaxed difficuly game and turns it into a hell hole. Because of this mission I've yet to beat this game and ever will. Even with guides its still difficult because its a roll of the dice whenever you try to do anything."
"  pros:   great story  ---------------  cons:  horrible controls.  ai can simply walk behind your lines for insta kill of all your guys when you select them.  if you run into enemy range they will shoot until you finaly select a weapon and fire back, then they will shoot again. even spamming esc will not get you out of the menu fast enough.  being behind cover for enemies takes 22+ hits to kill them. where as they can run up to you and shoot you twice for the win.  very horrble controls 'worth mentioning twice'  advertising the game as hard just to offest the horrible AI.  -----------------------------------   this game was a gift and i still feel ripped off.

CONTROLLS SUCK AND THE GAME OVERRIDES STOPPING THE GAME WHEN YOU WANT. THE CONTROLLS WERE MADE BY IDIOTS THAT KNOW NOTHING ABOUT COMBAT. I WILL BE DELEATING THIS FROM MY LIST. WHAT A JOKE AN A WASTE OF MONEY.
Like Skyrim with guns.
"The game started fantastic, with great military concept and tactical gameplay. But it all seems for nothing when the missions are so linear and repetitive. All missions seem to have a 'set' path to victory, so missions depend more about following the pattern and less about developing your own tactics. I felt locked into playing missions how the developers wanted me to play them, and had no real free choice to make decisions myself. I wish the maps were bigger, with more units to use and longer, more drawn out battles. The game needs a random element. A good fun game for a few hours, but nothing i would reccomend to anyone."
wish they make remastered version of VC 3 for pc.
"I don't usally anime (because, ya know) , but when I do, I choose valkyria chronicles."
"This game is awesome, Both story and gameplay are really fascinating~ And such a cute graphic ^^"
great game
"While the story elements are interesting, and there is a solid parallel world created to support them, Valkyria Chronicles suffers on both its console origins and its gameplay mechanics.  Controls are somewhat finicky, with the more menu-intensive sections of the game requiring a combination of Enter, Spacebar, mouse clicks and other key inputs to navigate. Certainly made to be played with a gamepad.  The gameplay is where things fall flat in my opinion. After a few missions, it not only becomes a repetitive, unrealistic depiction of squad operations, it becomes clear that mission design requires the player to 'figure out the puzzle' in order to complete a mission. In what seems to be an increasing number of missions, the otherwise brain-dead AI is boosted through deus ex machina solutions like giant tanks, time limits, endless enemy waves and other known tropes. Add this to the very repetitive nature of the gameplay itself and the slow progress of the turn-based strategy genre and it quickly becomes a mind-numbing affair.  A final gripe for me was its ridiculously large footprint (26 GB). I realize HDD space is cheap, but still this felt like sloppy data packaging. I wish the game had just let me look at all the cutscenes that while super campy and firmly in saturday morning anime territory, had decent voice acting and seemed to be headed in an interesting direction.  Played 10 hours, uninstalled."
"I cannot recommend this game. My version (PC) has numerous bugs; from buttons not working unless I tab out to certain areas of the maps that I can't go to or my characters fall through.  But the worst part, imo, are the missions. There's considerable inconsistencies with how to play one level from the next and there's very little leeway to make mistakes. I rarely am able to win a mission on my first try, but this isn't because the opponent is skilled or tough; Most of the time, its because the 'briefing' provides so little or false information that I deploy the wrong units.   In terms of the inconsistencies, there's maps where your primary goal is to capture the flag ASAP, and you're rewarded for bypassing other objectives to take the flag. Then there's maps that punish you for capturing it quickly, which is frustrating because of the amount of set-up things take. The game is relatively slow paced, so it gets really frustrating to see a carefully laid out strategy fail because THIS tank is immune to machine gun file while ALL other tanks were not. Its these lack of inconsistencies and the amount of time it takes to find out the differences that really kill it for me in this game."
"I like the style and everything, but unskippable cutscenes and heavy turned based RPG mechanics bog down the game to the point where I'd rather do about anything else. Character builds are alarmingly simple; this plays a lot like an MMO, and that's not something I want from a game with an ending. Repetitive mission design. Takes a while to start seeing new scenarios (like tanks, etc). I wouldn't recommend it for myself now. I probably would have loved every minute when I was a huge anime nerd pre-teen."
Tactical mini skirts and knee high socks.
"I enjoyed the story. I enjoyed the progressive difficulty. I enjoyed the characters, even when they introduced a ♥♥♥♥ing PIG as part of the squad. What I did not enjoy, and what ruined the game for me, is the sudden jump in difficulty in chapter 7. Out of nowhere, you're facing an UNBEATABLE boss that gets as many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shots on you as she wants each turn (because OF COURSE the computer keeps as much CP as possible); and a tank that can't even take damage until you've busted down all of its turrets, SHOT ALL FOUR RADIATORS and kept all of your people alive. All while the UNBEATABLE BOSS gets to smack down ALL of your people without taking any damage. ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I will NEVER play this game again, and I strongly discourage ANYONE from playing this game. What a waste of money."

Man this game is better than what i thought it was going to be. If you like anime then this is a must have as the story is told in an anime style. If you watched Full Metal Alchemist then this is a must have as it has a similar setting as it. The combat is both simple and complicated. Simple controls but complicated conditions. Full price is definitely worth it as theres 40+ hours of content with an A-grade story. It's a steal at sale price and I recomend it to anyone that loves JRPGs or strategy games like XCOM.  The option menu is really light because its not a demanding game. You only have resolution options and v sync. Any PC that is 5 years old or less should have no problem running this game. Has both English and Japanese voice acting and both are great. Play your first play through in one language and then play NG+ on the other for a different experience.
"This game is truly an original. Gameplay is fun; it is very original. Breath of fresh air there. Turn based, yet a third person shooter with strategy elements. Truly original.  As for story, many of the story aspects can be quite engaging. I am very appreciative of it. But let me clarify: if you are looking for a complicated, arcing story with plot twists around every corner and drama, this is NOT going to happen. The story is much simpler than Game of Thrones. That being said, the story has a refreshing air to it. Maybe it is because it deliberately includes several historical elements of World War 2, including viewpoints.  My grandfather fought for the liberation of Holland in WW2. This game takes a huge amount of inspiration from Holland's history, so the game speaks to me personally.  If you like good strategy games (with the odd historical easter egg for the history buff) in any way, but also like new worlds with refreshing, peaceful (despite it being about war) storylines, this game is the one for you.  9/10"
"Putting aside the repulsively childish depiction of the horrors of world war two, it's good weebshit"
Its lit
"Confusing and all around bad controls that take a while to get used to bad combat mechanics, and gets nearly impossible at some parts, with a terrible save system, and occasional crashes. Also, while it has tons of levels, at least half of them are just cut scenes."
Played halfway through the game.   Marina is now my Waifu.  10/10

"So you like X-com ? You like WW2 ? You like 13 yo lolis who go to war in mini skirts ? You hate russians ? Welcome then in Valkyria Chronicles, a game so japanese that i feel the urge to do stupid ♥♥♥♥ like cosplay and squandering away my unemployement benefit in chibi figurines every time i launch it.  Follow the thrilling adventures of Welkin, the young leutenant of an heroic squad of (cliché ?) characters more or less endearing in a colourful world racist towards black hair. Following a gameplay in between a turn based strategy game and well, a fluid and interesting FPS, walk your way in beatifull maps while murdering  everything  in range of your rifle or your 50mm antichar cannon. Special mention for the kindness of the soldiers who can recognize when it's not their turn to shoot.  Play 5 differents classes with specificity so specific that you will probably want to main one or two at the expense of the others. Loot the maximum amount of ressources during missions in order to upgrade your equipment and train your soldier so they can raise from unorganized grabasstic pieces of amphibian ♥♥♥♥ to minister of death praying for war.  The story is engaging albeit previsible (Yo, it's a JRPG fam, what did you expect ?) and is embellished by hours of cinematics and dialogues with an excellent japanese dubbing and a correct english audio. Soundtracks are ok. But because of the recurrence of the same battle themes they can be a bit boring if you chain the missions. Wait for a sale to buy it if you are an absolute ungenerous rat like me and use the money you saved to perfect your cosplay of antitank mine for the next convention."

"Before you buy it, I'd recommend watching a video of someone else playing it, try to avoid anyone harping too much on the weak controls, they're pretty bad, but if you're patient you can work around it.  Could've been much better, the port of the game to PC has done an extraordinary job fixing some of the bugs that plague this game, however too many remain, with the addition of more game breaking faults.  As this game will probably not be getting patched, these are what to look forward to, while trying to enjoy what is at it's core, a very fun strategy game.  -The tank controls are very unpredictable, sometimes when you press 'left' the game rotates the tank to the left, other times you press 'left' the tank begins to drive backwards. The real problem is that the game uses two modes (keyboard/mouse) of input when only one was necessary. Ideally the mouse would be used to pan the camera, what it does however is begin to spin your tank out of control, in this game you only get so much 'movement' and then your turn is over.  -The tank is in EVERY mission, sure the tank can kick some major butt in most situations, but when it's not useful, the tank simply becomes a huge escort mission (One that can be killed with a single shot or within a single enemy turn pretty easily.) You can try to use the tank as mobile cover in this scenario, however the buggy controls will often cause you to run your teammates over, not doing any damage, but still frustrating.  -Unskippable cutscenes during missions, this is only frustrating when you fail and retry a mission, normally this isn't much of a grievance, but they sure can drag on and on, repeating something that was at one time useful, but is now rage inducing to be said again.  -Sometimes you just miss, maybe it's some kind of RNG element at work here, but sometimes you just miss a target literally a meter or two in front of you. It's frustrating, but it is a strategy/FPS hybrid, I'm sure for those who have played enough of it, can work with it, but for those of us not willing to put in the amount of time, just go ahead and avoid snipers. And forget about any Lancer (anti-tank) skill shots either, unless you're completely masochistic.  All in all, the game is still interesting, it's worth $10, however I'm only saying that because it's too late for a refund, I'd rather just have my $10 back."
" TL;DR     Not recommended  - If you're into strategy games wherein you expect to do your own way, be creative and still get the best possible grade in a match, then this game's not for you. Now,    Recommended  - If you don't mind doing trial-and-error and figuring out that 'one and only best set of moves/solution' to get the best rank/grade, then you can go and enjoy this game, along with it's great artstyle and score.  This review will surely be just buried under the multitude of positive reviews and other negative reviews. So I'll just quote something from another steam customer review, the main point that made me not recommend this very well-polished game.    Originally posted by  DOZO, 33.5 Hours :"
"A big resounding meh.  Pacing is awkward, gameplay is even more awkward, animations are sketchy at best.  Requirements for ranks completely ruins the idea of free will in this game, causing game mechanics to be forced (I suppose this is a Japanese game after all) onto you. Frankly, I'd rather be able to take on a situation the best way possible (No damage, no casualties, stealth), instead of sprinting across a tiny little map at breakneck speed ignoring enemies and cover with, by the way, an amazingly long and high amount of loading times for the newest generation SSD, which is appaling to say the least, just to make your goal in time in the right amount of moves. This game plays more like a runner game of 'avoid the obstacles' than a tactical RTS.  If you're the kind of OCD freak that just LOVES to bust down a game and do only the minimal amount of what it takes to complete your goals, this game is for you. If you'd rather have a well thought out tactical game with a surprising hybrid of turnbased tactical RTSes and third person shooting, I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
"The storytelling is campy as hell but strangely still draws you in. And while I like watching anime once in a while, if this was an anime, it would probably be the type I would avoid. So they did something right in keeping me interested in the cookie cutter war fantasy plot.  The combat and mechanics have the right idea, but I've grown increasingly frustrated with the controls. I've wasted so many moves because the damn tank didn't move the way I wanted it to. Strategies often go out the window when troops make pathetic mistakes like missing shots from close range.  There is an unexplained need for me to finish this game and see through the story. But after that, I'll probably never touch this again. This game will strike a chord to some but I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone in general.  6/10."
"Some of the worst turn based combat mechanics ever designed. Story is interesting, but not worth having to suffer through the combat system."
"This game is so slow it feels tortuous. Got a tank? Watch it get stuck on invisible walls and deplete your movement points. I had one instance where my tank was apparently caught on an invisible hillock, a whole two inches high. Cue wasting precious resources.  Cut-scenes interrupt action continuously. You can't skip the enemy's turns in battle, meaning you've got to sit through every phase, which will usually outnumber yours greatly. There is one part where you are punished for taking action. Have you ever heard of a strategy game doing that to you?   The worst part is that the enemy will still hit you when it's not their phase. It's as though you get one go, and they get three. I've also noticed that, whether I'm crouched behind sandbags or not, I'm hit at the same rate as if I was standing.   There is a gem of a story in here, but due to the poor controls, overall battle speed, and frankly poor game play, I simply can't access it. I spent two hours on this, and to be frank, I don't feel it was at all enjoyable or interesting.  To the people who enjoyed it: I'm glad you did. But the PC port has some serious issues that need addressing, and as such make progressing a question of tossing a coin."
"Cutscene: 'War is so awful, when will this awful war be over...I just want to plant daffodils and hug kittens.'  In combat: 'I just shot a guy in the face!' *giggle* *bounce* *panties*  Cutscene: 'Every one of your lives is precious. Be smart and careful out there...'  In combat: '...except when we have to beat a stage in three turns so the god of war can give us an A rank. Would you mind just running through that minefield?'  Don't buy this game if you're looking for realistic military strategy. As a puzzle game with guns, it's frustrating but OK."
"I hate to say it, because I was so sure I was going to love this game, but I am actually very disappointed in how bad it is. (From a gameplay perspective. Visually, it looks great.) If you are the kind of person who likes a more masochistic experience (e.g. XCOM), then you may find something about this game appealing, but after playing several scenarios, I can honestly say that, for a game that is supposedly tactical, there are too many things about the combat and systems that are incoherent or just plain bad.  For starters, this is not actually a tactical RPG. It is a 'guess what the developer was thinking' puzzle game. In most tactical games, you are rewarded for making good strategic decisions and making efficient use of available resources. Not in Valkyria Chronicles, though. This game gives you a 'grade' at the end of every encounter, which determines the quality and quanitity of the spoils you receive. You lose points off your grade for taking too many rounds and are rewarded for using as few rounds as possible. This accomplishes two things from a gameplay perspective, both of which in my opinion are terrible: 1) It incentivizes you to make rash decisions, which is antithetical to tactics/strategy, 2) It assumes you want to replay the scenario over and over again until you trial-and-error work out the most efficient way to accomplish the victory condition in the fewest rounds. (Which I absolutely f***ing do not want to do.) So like I said, it is basically a 'guess what strategy the developer likes' puzzle game.  But another thing that doesn't make sense to me about this game is that you are literally always being shot. It is supposedly a turn-based game, which implies that the opponents take turns. But the enemies are almost always in a state of shooting you. They shoot you on their turn AND on your turn. In a typical tactical type game---hell even in XCOM which is a game I loathe---you typically have time on your turn to plan and strategize your next move, like a game of chess. If you have consumed your first action point and are deciding what to do with your second, you can typically at least look around, think about your options, etc. You know, STRATEGIZE. But in Valkyria Chronicles, if you consume your first action point, and are thinking about what to do with your second action point, enemies will just stand there and shoot you repeatedly the whole time you are thinking it out, then they'll KEEP shooting you once you actually take an action. It is literally possible for enemies to shoot you to death while you are just trying to turn your character around to face the other direction so that you can perform an attack. What makes it especially egregious for me, though, is that turns don’t end automatically. You have to manually declare that your turn is over, so even if you consume all your actions points and it is literally impossible for you to take any more actions, you had better remember to manually declare that your turn is over, because every second that you don't declare that your turn is over, the enemy will be shooting you to death. This results in the ridiculous situation where I will command a unit to attack, and then the whole time the attack is being executed, I am furiously tapping B so that the 'end turn?' prompt comes up as soon as possible so that I can minimize how many times I get shot for not declaring my turn is over fast enough. Who thought this was a good idea? Why do so many people think this is a good idea? It seems like such an obviously bad idea to me.  But then there are other little annoyances, too, like how you always want to end your turn by running up to a sand bag wall to take cover, but if you keep holding foward as you approach the wall, your unit will just JUMP OVER the wall and get shot. So this means you have to run up to the wall to take cover, but be very very careful not to walk TOO close to the wall or you’ll do the exact OPPOSITE of taking cover--namely to jump out in front of the wall and ask the enemy to please shoot you as much as possible. This, too, seems like the worst possible way to configure this aspect of the combat. And then other weird things like units getting a defense bonus for being behind a sandbag wall, even if you just jumped over the sandbag wall and are shooting them right in the face? Sure, okay.  But the point where it dawned on me that maybe this game was going to be kind of bad instead of amazing was one of the very first scenarios. In one of the early missions, there is a part midway through the encounter where a tank randomly shows up that you had no idea was going to be there. The game takes the liberty of moving all of your units directly next to the tank, regardless of where you had placed them, so that the tank can shoot them.(For drama, I guess?) I replayed the scenario to make sure it wasn't MY mistake, and tried being extra careful to keep my units far away from where the tank would inevitably enter, but this proved to be a waste of effort, because even though I kept my units 200 feet away from the tank's point of entry, the game played the cutscene of the tank arriving, and when the cutscene was over, my units were inexplicably and arbitrarily all right there, next to the tank once again, which of course promptly shot them with a tank shell. Yeah, sure, okay, makes sense. Much strategy. Very tactics.  Also, the only reason I can think of for a game to make me manually select each successive cutscenes to view from a storybook style menu is to obfuscate the length of what would otherwise be some really damn long cutscenes. At least if they had just made it one really long cutscene I would only have to press 'skip' once instead of eight times.  I just don't get it. I want to like it SO HARD, but it is an incomprehensible mess to me. I just do not understand it."
"I find this game both ludicrous story wise as well as repetitive playing wise. The story makes my brain hurt. Nope.   Also, 16 GB!!! what a waste of time."
"Beautiful story and awesome characters, but terrible interface (waiting for animations to finish before you can do something) and extremely frustrating missions topped off with randomly triggered character abilities make for a not so fun experience. If you dont mind save/reloading a whole lot or watching videos or reading guides before hand to know what each missions gimmicks are then its a great game, but for everyone else its a frustrating experience that should be avoided, unfortunately."
"I didn't got warned of the possible crashing taking place, and there is no autosave. Got all my progress lost due to some developer's fault, i know i am just angry about something that might get patched, but if you are playing this game or thinking about buying it:  Its ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, just DO NOT forget to save, no autosave in-game."
"At least once per chapter my game crashes towards the end of completing a mission. I could save every 2 seconds but I bought the game to play it, not spend 90% saving in fear of random crashes."
"VK looks great but plays terrible. The 'critical acclaim' is almost entirely from people more interested in JP culture, humor, and memes than gameplay, because the gameplay is simply terrible. Like several reviewers have noted this is actually a puzzle game, not an RPG, and it's a very bad puzzle game, full of nonsensical design decisions, bugs, bad AI, and exploits. You will be wasting time doing (almost) the exact same things over and over and over and over and over AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER while you attempt to game the broken system that underpins this mess merely so you can advance the story and pass whatever awful broken level you're currently trying to slog through. After about 5 of these idiotic set piece puzzle disasters I threw in the towel and deleted this trash.  If you love poorly written JP tales of World Wars and girls in miniskirts wielding massive weapons then you might give it a look, but you'll have to love the story and characters a whole lot to force yourself through the mind numbing, incredibly annoying, absolutely awful 'gameplay' to actually see them.  Uninstalled."
i enjoyed it untill i learned how broken it is i was haveing trouble with a mssion where you have to stop an escape i just couldnt do it so i looked up some tips and i found out that you can easily beat it in one turn with one caracter i thought that was stange but mabye it was just a badly designed level so i kept looking and i found out that to get the really good ratings you have to exploit the game listen to the people that say this isnt a stratagy game its a puzzle game and not a good one at that.
"So I was looking for a nice RPG, or a decently-long story game. Something to immerse myself in for a good long while. Saw this on sale, got it for less than 6 bucks. Now I'm wating for a refund if possible. I honestly don't understand the number of positive reviews on this game.  Let me explain my problems with this game (I'll judge the story separately); instead of having a good and challenging AI, mechanics of the game are simply stacked against the player. In this game, moving units together in groups is impossible, so you're forced to move them one-by-one into enemy defensive formations. This game really makes defending easy. And you're never the one defending (even though you play as the country that is being invaded, but I digress). The Snipers you get have very low accuracy and miss most of the time unless you're 10 meters away, while enemy snipers have f*cking pinpoint accuracy and can but a bullet in your head from across the map 100% of the time. After the desert level where the enemy just pumps out sniper units is when I decided I didn't want to play this game anymore. And no, I actually beat the desert level. At the last part I just had to move my tank right to the last enemy garrison and kill the snipers as they spawned and then send a wave of scouts to bum rush their camp because everyone else died. Some aspects of the game can be rewarding towards tactical thinking, but I felt like the only really challenge in the game are the mechanics that are so blatantly rigged against the players' favor.  Now for the story. I'm hesitant to judge to the story as I typically don't want to judge a show I haven't seen the entirety of. However, the story was not gripping enough for me to want to endure the sh*tty gameplay; and that at the very least should have been it's saving grace. The cast seemed bland and have no depth to them. They lost all intrigue after the first few chapters. I, however, do not know if some fantastic character development happens and they actually become interesting characters. Though I am doubtful that is the case. I know there is a romance aspect to the story, but as far as I'm concerned romance between two boring characters is a boring romance.  Though, seeing as this game has an impressive lack of negative reviews, maybe this game is just not for me. I do stand by my critiques of the gameplay. It is absolute trash.  If you like cheesy stories populated by bland easy-to-relate characters set in a WW2 esque setting then go ahead and throw money at this... story.  If you like war or strategy games then avoid this thing like the plague. You will watch in digust as the idiotic AI fumbles about and snipes all of your units with hawk-like precision.  Sorry if I'm ranting. This game left I bad taste in my mouth, and writing this salty review is helping me get over it."
I kinda liked the story of this game and art/graphic style but the game play is very boring ...
"The only reason this game is getting an upvote from me is because it's not Operation Darkness...  Ever tried playing Operation Darkness? Yeah well I beat it... I actually figured out that game's shoddy mechanics and completed it somehow...  In comparison to that game, Valkyria is a japanese strategy game masterpiece... which isn't saying much... in fact it's just okay but whatever... here are the Cons and Pro... yeah probably just the one about this game:  - Characters are drab and forgettable. - Story is typical and boring, full of cliches... people die, emotions are felt... etc. - Cutscenes are spliced in order to transition from one location to the next.  - Game is too long... add the boredom factor and it just extends the length to untolerable levels.  It honestly feels like I should have A.D.D. to enjoy the story progression (It annoys me that I have to watch 2 minute snipits of garbage dialog because the developers were too lazy to tell a proper cohesive story)  +Graphics are decent even by today's standards. +Gameplay is fun if you enjoy mastering video games, which means I predict a lot of reloading save files in your future. +Just as easy to put down as it is to pick up and play... of which you will be doing a lot of, I can't play more than 1 mission a day otherwise I just want to fall asleep.  So yeah there you have it... a mediocre game at best... find it on sale somewhere, it's not really worth the $20 price tag. It's not a terrible game, just not a very good one... I've just seen all this crap before and it doesn't really do anything for me personally.   *Yawn* ... just trying to explain what bores me about this game makes me tired...."
"- Story is super cheesy. - Dialogue is bad/childish - Battles are tedious (sorry you just lost the last 2 hours of your life, would you like to try again). - Buried tech in Poland/Lithuania and for some reason a desert  There's just no reason for anyone to play this anymore with all of the other strategy RPGs options out there."
"Valkyria Chronicles was originally a PS3 exclusive, however the port to the PC works quite well, with the exception of non-effecient tank driving.  For a game that relies heavily on plot it rarely drops you into a battle. But when you fight you have to fight hard if you wan't to make effecient progress.  Core concepts of the gameplay are balancing troops with draw-backs and buffs as well as grouping people who 'like' eachother together. Grouping friends together gives them certain boosts like damage, some troops however have major drawbacks like the character Susie Evans. Susie is a pacifist which means theres a chance in which you order her to attack she'll simply aim and say 'I can't do it!' then end her turn, this is a heavy drawback as Susie is a scout, a class that is good at moving into open space to attack and then run to cover. If 'pacifist' activates you either need to spend another turn getting Susie to cover or let her die.  The game has a few balance issues such as the inability to hit a target at point-blank range with a tank cannon however because the deviation of your projectile is based on RNG it also means you can pull insanely stupid stuff like sniping a tanks engine from half way across the map because RNGsus said your bullet was 100% accurate.  With my experience with this game I've found it extremely hard to take down armored targets because Tank cannons and Lances (Or RPGs) are extremely innacurate in compairison to other weapons. However this only seems to be true for myself, as the enemy can fire an Lance from on top of a cliff and hit a soldier.  If you're a Japaboo you'll wanna play the game in Japanese however the english subtitles are more or less completely innacurate to the actual diolauge. The english dub of the game is... questionable. To me it felt as if certain characters lost quirks while they gained others, however there's always a daimond or two in the dirt so a few characters fit their voices.  Other elements of the game include leveling up your troops, giving them better equipment, upgrading your tank and a lesser known function visiting the graveyard. If you have lost no soldiers in combat (Your troop falls than is 'tagged' by an enemy) an old war veteran will teach you certain orders you will not learn by training your troops. However these orders cost large ammounts of exp so you must balance between getting new orders and training your troops.  Personally I feel as if one of the major problems with the game are ids difficulty spikes. Some levels are crazy easy others are mad hard. One example of this may be the battles you play in the 'Barrius Desert' in which the first battle is as simple as crossing a plane while the game introduces a 'sandstorm' effect, To which the second fight has you fighting not only a tank that does not take damage every time you hit it, but also has a pair of giant cannons on the front and rear that insta-kill the Edelwiess if you're caught in its cone and a grand total of 6 machine guns that will attempt to mow down any infantry that try to get close, and while you can destroy these guns you have to hit the gun mantlet, if your shot so much as lands five inches to the left of the gun- no damage. All the while a second boss comes in that you are unable to kill whom wields a weapon that anhialates infantry.  The long and short of this review is... If you enter VC with expectations of plot and engaging gameplay, You'll get plot. If you have busted luck and RNGsus is always on your side- play on EX mode to get the same experience as me. The game tells a better story than the anime and has less cliche'd romance ♥♥♥♥ but if you're not prepared to pour blood sweat and tears into balls to the walls insane fights... &gt;Youregunnahaveabadtime.jpg"
"Well, I guess I'm done with Valkyria Chronicles. I've put over 10 hours into it and made it to chapter 5.  I love the graphics and the voice acting. I also like the idea of how the combat works. However...  I can't stand the story, and it's a huge part of the game. I don't much care for the stereotypical Anime character design, either. The story feels like it was written for children. For example:   http://i.imgur.com/vTHkDRWl.jpg  'Bridges are important. They link the roads that bring people what they need.'  I don't care about the characters. The soldiers are mostly teenagers. The Medic is 17 years old, and the tank driver is 16 (and has attended tank driving school and engineering school, too)! The prejudice against 'dark-hairs' is pretty silly too. It just seems randomly stirred into the story for extra drama.  And while I like the *idea* of the combat, the way it actually plays out just isn't doing it for me. It reminds me too much of X-COM, where you can line up a perfect shot and still have it miss and get killed by return fire. Or maybe like Mass Effect 1 combat, where aiming didn't really matter much at low levels - low level characters just missed a lot.  Oh, and it has a limit of 20 save slots. Ridiculous.  Not long ago I had a lot more tolerance for this kind of sappy, melodramatic story. I enjoyed the Advance Wars series. But for whatever reason, I'm finding it intolerable now. I found that I was forcing myself to play the game to make progress, rather than looking forward to playing it and not being able to put it down.  Sorry Valkyria Chronicles. I wanted to like you, but I guess you are just too stereotypically Japanese for me."
"I have plenty of problems with this as a game, but I guess a lot of them are down to me wanting a wargame with a light animu gloss and getting an animu with a light wargame gloss. The system of movement is counterintuitive and jarring, the structure is a rail you ride until the predetermined conclusion and there isn't much more to it than that. The most offensive thing about the gameplay to me is probably the jarring gap between meticulously aiming at a target and then having a dice roll dictate that you miss it. I don't have a problem with a dice roll making me miss a target, but why are you letting me aim specifically at it beforehand? So sure, I found the game parts frustrating and uneven, although most of them were very easy.  But I'll be damned if now that I've finished, I don't find myself sort of missing its world and characters. I don't have many problems with the story. It's ludicrously basic and simple but that's not necessarily a bad thing. All of the characters have little arcs, and there are things you like about all of them. I could have done with a bit more military discipline in their interactions and at one point there's some hackneyed 'we're a family' garbage that made me gag, along with some other saccharine anime stuff. But that aside, it does what a story is meant to. There are things set up early in the story that pay off later, and the characters that you've come to like ultimately band together to triumph over adversity and save the day. It's essentially solid. I don't think I'll ever be interested in playing it again, but I enjoyed it well enough as a nice little story, which is basically all it is. I also deeply hated the pig with wings, but mercifully it's not actually in the game all that much.  So if you think you'll enjoy a nice, colorful little war story with some very light strategy elements, give it a try. I even got choked up a few times, particularly by Selvaria. Oh, and if you're into that sort of thing this game features both Akio Ohtsuka, the voice of Solid Snake, and his late father Chikao Ohtsuka, in several scenes together."
"Valkyria Chronicles starts off nice, and looked like it was going to be a fun tactical game, but the balance really isn't there. The game promotes beating missions in the least amount of time possible in order to get the most rewards, and that really boils down to rushing in one of your units a large majority of the time. In addition, this unit becomes very powerful, very early due to a challenge mission, and somewhat obsoletes the tactical advantage of using a variety of soldiers. I stopped playing after chapter 7, where an incredibly powerful unit spawned without warning and killed most of soldiers in a single turn. From reading other reviews, it seems that this isn't the last time that the game decides to throw a curveball at you, where the only real way to effectively deal with said curveball is to know what's being thrown at you in advance. Restarting a mission I've already spent at least 30 minutes on isn't really appealing. There are also a few control issues, like not having proper mouse controls in menus because it's a PS3 port, and there are some framerate issues that make the game slower than it really needs to be. I like the style, and I like the ideas the game brings to a tactics game, but ultimately the execution just missed of the mark for me."
Too many boring and dragged out cut scenes and only like 40% of it is the actual game

"I played this game, for the most part, in it's entirety and i simply cannot recommend it, and ended up putting it down on the second to last level.   I noticed that this game is not so much a tactical turn-based game, put a puzzle game under a guise of a strat-jRPG-lite-psuedo garbage.   After a certain point levels become nearly impossible to complete with out some strange and arbitrary movements , attacks and unit placements, that really take away from atmosphere of the combat and the game itself. All of this cannot be discovered by logic, however only by constant trail and error and/or the use of guides. But alas, after 40 hours of mostly not fun gameplay i sent this game to it's grave and regret having given it the chance i did. Why so long you ask? I will mention below a few of the redeeming aspects, that and i am a hard headed idiot that was determined to beat this game into the ground. Instead it beat me into the ground - and not in the good way like Hotline Miami, or a rewarding RPG like Pillars of Eternity ; it beat me into the ground like an abusive girl friend with a fetish for half baked curb stomps.    I am all for difficult games, and grinded through many nonesense missions which are meant to be beat using minimal troop outputs for quick completions, something which was not very obvous at first. Then all a sudden, the last few levels introduce a massive difficulty spike - FORCING you to go back and redo these stupid missions battles just to grind XP. I had been fed up by this game at this point, but this was the last straw. (this is all without getting into some rediculous plot decisions and loopholes or the pretty poorly implemented 'atribute' syestem).   It is a shame because the graphical style and ART direction are wonderful in this game, and (despite being super trite and anime, i mean it is a japanese game) the characters were likable enough that i didn't want anyone to die.  ~E~"
"First off, the majority of positive reviews for this game are helpful and informative. This game just didn't do it for me. --- It's hard for me to recommend someone else spending money on this game.  It is incredibly heavy on story, and that would be fine if I found the story interesting, but it focuses on Squad 7 in a mostly dry slice-of-life lense. The best it did was to push the idea of forgiveness, even for your attackers.  Real life history and its politics from pre-WW1 through WW2 are far more colorful in spite of the over the top bombast. One of the emotional moments in the game didn't feel earned either because vague spoiler    it was a cutscene death that completely ignored the lore surrounding Ragnaid, and nobody even tried to save the character, making the whole thing feel weak, but it was followed up by some legit-awesome character development  . I had a few laughs when a couple emotional moments in the main story were ruined by breast jiggle physics. There are optional cutscenes that help humanize the characters.  Some of the missions felt too much like trial and error, which is where a lot of my pain came from, having to re-do missions and endure the arduous process of watching the enemy turn play out slowly. More pain came from the nonsensical rules for completion or failure, turning war into flag football. If a single enemy touches your base's flag and flips it to their color, it's a game over. Same for them though.  The menus are so clunky and bloated.  Swapping out units and their special gear are separate menus within menus and lead to me not stressing out over min-maxing traits for each battle and poring over the roster beyond maximizing friendships for group-attacking. Within battles themselves, I repeatedly got surprised by how unreliable the maps in the game were after actually seeing the level during action.   I wish the game started around Chapter 10, where the tech tree opens up and allowed me to experiment with a variety of weapon types. While there's perma-death, it's hard to grow attached to any of the characters on a gameplay level when it's so easy to recover them and throw them back into the fray.  Finally, don't play the Challenge Skirmishes until you are late into the game. Some can be done early(Scout/Engineer in particular), but most cannot. This game was a slog, and the only thing that held it back for me was how needlessly slow it felt."
"VC is more a interactive movie than a game. Too much cutscenes with childish dialogue for a war-themed game (even for a JRPG). Also, there is no reward for classical tactics in this game, since your ingame rank are based in how fast you accomplish the mission which often makes the player take imprudent moves that may f*** up the mission.   5/10."
GR8 GAME M8's
"Was not very fun, and the UI sucks big time! Tou have to watch ten movies for every battle you can play."
This game is more of a puzzle game than a strategy game. What I mean is that the numbers are so unbalanced and levels so poorly designed that the correct way to beat a level is discovering hidden solutions instead of strategizing and executing. THIS IS NOT FUN AT ALL!
"Not recommend If you want a good strategy game.  This game are so ♥♥♥♥ing EASY.  AI can't do anything to you, they just run into you and wait for you to head shot them all.        I killed LAST BOSS in three turn.  I Killed VALKYRIE GIRL BY 3 HEAD SHOTS.  "
so ive played about 2 hours of this game so far and as an avid player of strategy games I honestly feel like this is more of a puzzle game than a strategy game as it seems there is one or two ways to beat any mission and any variantion results in quick death. The game makes you feel massivesly inadequate early on and makes you die a lot and as a strategy game it implies there are multiple ways to accomplish your objectives but every map ive played so far is a straight path with no way to flank or do anything but advance straight at the enemy instead of flanking them and negating their cover. I feel like this game has a lot of potential and a good story and I really want to like this game and will try again but if the scenarios dont start to feel more open and less scripted I will not likely change my recommendation.
"It stars out pretty good and fun, then you get sniped by tanks, while missing shots from twenty feet away, while shooting at said tanks, and realize it's not so fun. Will get through this game, but don't see myself longing for another go. Also it's on rails, which at least ensures I will get through it. For instance, putting snipers in high positions is a no brainer, but they will get sniped by tanks, i effin' kid you not.   Not really as much strategy as I was hoping to find after hearing about this game for the past oh, five years? It kept popping up on good rpg list and the like. I really like the animations, story is cookie cutter and a bit obtuse given the ww2 emulated setting. Also it has the utter stupid system of being able to use command points to move and shoot 1 unit as many times as you'd like. So, i have 9 units on field, and all I do is, use tank, heal tank as needed, snipe when i can, and that's it. It's immune to regular fire, so once enemy anti-tank units are gone, just go nuts.  Again, not anyway shape or form worthy of the praise it's been getting. If your like me, and grew up in nineties, you should be long and far away from any of the potential cliche JRPG story crap people pass of as nostalgic. It's not, it's campy, simplistic to the point of shallow, and a waste of an otherwise effective and fun storytelling device."
"game crashed after I finished managing my troops for the first time and I lost an hour or more of progress.  cool game, but with how time-consuming it can be I don't think its worth buying if its just going to ♥♥♥♥ up randomly."
"Fun game on ps3, hell to even get going or running without crashes for steam.  Little disappointing."
Don't buy this if you actually want to play it. It goes to load and then nothing but a black screen. Lots of others with this issue still no solution thanks steam it's bioshock 2 all over again.
"This is great game, it is engaging, the story is good, performance is great.   However, it is frustrating. After chapter 10 missions will become unpredictable and unfair, you'll have to save a lot because ANYTHING can happen, it seems that sightlines are worse for you than the enemy (for xcom players it's similar to 'overwatch').   The pace is extremely slow, you cannot skip enemy turns or make them faster, if you make a mistake you'll have to watch your enemy do a full turn before you can even exit. You also waste a lot of time navigating the menus because they were obviously made for consoles. If you try to control the tank with a mouse it constantly glitches.  There is also no replay value, my last saves were deleted and I have to go through the same frustration again. It might not be the same in the first run, and you might just get through these annoying missions because the story is actually interesting.  tl;dr  A fantastic game ruined by small things that makes it frustrating to play."
best JRPG i have play.. good story and gameplay unique graphic 
Bought the bundle this past week and it didn't come with an .exe file. Can't play it and Steam/Sega support is giving me the run around. Can't fairly rate it but have to give it a ZERO STAR rating as of now due to them failing to include all necessary files
"I can't in good conscience recommend this game after the idiotic, stacked deck of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that is Chapter 14."
"This is a great game, and keyboard and mouse mapping is very ituitive, however it turns off itself too often... and you lose alot of progress if you don;t manaully save it. Please fix it! (my OS: WIN10)"
Repeating gameplay and too many crashes. Sometimes I wonder if I have accidentally downloaded a prirate version.
"a bad anime mixed with a bad hybrid RTS/TBS/FPS (with RPG elements of course). I know it tries to do good with the whole 'world war two game that acknowledges concentration camps' thing, but it shies away from even that. it does nothing well."
meh. the controls absolutely ruin any potential for this game to be enjoyable. I played for the first few chapters and decided to wash my hands of this game.
"When i started this game i quite enjoyed it but the more i played the more its flaws began to annoy me to the point i just lost interest in playing. The game is sort of a JPRG take on WW2 with the story loosely based on it (though with fictional countries involved) with squad based strategy combat. The story revolves around the neutral country of Gallia which is invaded by the Empire who are intent on using Gallias abundant Ragnite which is basically a fuel source. You play as a militia squad as they fight the Empire forces.   Good points: - the odd mix of squad based strategy with JRPG elements and style actually works quite well - the way combat works is quite good.You have a limited number of command points eachturn which you spend to move characters and have them attack. You can control the characters yourself moving them around and aiming at the enemy.  Bad points: -the standard levels in this game are enjoyable as you've more freedom to approach it as you like but theres a good number of 'gimmicky' levels, for example one where you have to stop an armoured car before it escapes, and the problem with these is its very difficult to beat these first time round as it takes a few attempts to figure out the right way to do it. Given a battle cant take up to an hour sometimes this gets very frustrating and while i admire the attempt to stop things getting stale these levels are just annoying to play as well as feeling more restricted in your approach - at the end of a battle your awarded a class simply based on how quickly you beat the level and nothing else. However beating to beat a level quickly usually involves just rushing one or two scouts through the map and capturing the flag,which isnt really fun and makes a more tactical and thorough approach pointless. Given that a higher class rating means more exp and money for upgrades this is a problem.  - and on the subject of exp and money the only way to accumalate exp outside the story is through skirmishes which are replayable battles.Late in the game i found my squad was under-levelled and i was struggling in the story missions. My only option to gain more exp was to grind the skirmish battles which got boring real quick.  Overall this game was just disappointing. It shows a lot of promise early on but after 25 hours i'd just had enough and had no desire to play it anymore."

"Completely unplayable. Fights slow down to a crawl even on low settings. Don't bother, it's a bad port of an otherwise great game."
The game seems interesting but there seem to be huge stability issues on AMD graphics cards. Played around 40 minutes so far and I have had 3 crashes.
"It's too corny for me. Don't know about you though. It plays like a bad anime, but then that's just my view. If you can tolerate the generic anime characters, it's a rather decent turn-based strategy game, with its only problems stemming from a sad attempt to combine third-person shooter action and tactical squad based combat. Porting quality is kind of depressing as well, but at least it's better than Final Fantasy Type-0. I'd reccomend playing Valkyria Chronicles 2 over this. Go get it and play it on an emulator. It's not bad."
"Most annoying tank pay game ever. Tried three times and it burnt my patience. I need the freaking tank gun to hit a weak spot on emeny, instead, all three times, it hit my own god damn town gate about 100m away. And btw, I have one attack per turn and it seems enemy has unlimit attack turns. PLAY XCOM if u want a nice GAME. PLAY this if u are addicted to anime."
"fun and interesting game, but a steam linked game that also required uplay downloader is a bit of an annoyance"
"Greatest game of all time.   /beat several times on PS3, just bought on PC to throw more money at it. Thus my low play time."

"Imagine if Alexander the Great's empire hadn't collapsed, but managed to hold onto and encompass everything east of the Ural Mountains. Then in the 1930s, the Emperor becomes Hitler sans Final Solution and starts World War II. Oh, and there's magic-based nukes and a legendary race of sexy Jedi ladies (no I'm not making that up). Thus is the world of Valkyria Chronicles.  It's hard to give this game a recommendation. As much as I'm enjoying the gameplay, there's so many little problems with the mechanics that add up to a big leech on that enjoyment. First and foremost is the lack of saving during battles. This wouldn't be an issue if the gameplay were faster, or at least more fluid. Even in the early game, one battle can take well over an hour to finish. Sometimes you just don't have that much time to waste on a game. A simple addition of checkpoint saves would have taken care of the problem nicely. Alas, you must slog through each battle start to finish. Because JRPG, I guess.  Secondly, the cover system is a joke. Why only sandbag barricades? Why can't I crouch behind a waist-high crate? WHY, GAME???  Third, grenades are an even bigger joke. With an effective range of maybe 20 feet, getting close enough to hit someone with one puts you WELL within range of endless gunfire. Their only purpose seems to be destroying sandbag barricades and artillery—and nothing else, not even wooden boxes.  GRENADES DO NOT WORK THAT WAY. Good night.  Other than that, the game is all right. It doesn't bog you down with a huge amount of different units and mechanics, easy for even beginners to strategy games to get into. There is a fair amount of grinding required to get your unit/equipment levels up, but that's JRPGs for you.  On the plus side, if you hate anime storylines, you can skip through 95% of the cutscenes and just get to the shooty-shooty-bang-bang."
"This game feels slow. That's not a bad thing in turn-based combat, but the game is also lacking in the tension of a game like XCOM. Every move doesn't feel like it matters, and each battle is either an easy win that takes an hour and a half or a quick loss. The combat doesn't ebb and flow, and the relatively linear missions (each of which MUST be won to advance the game) means that there's no element of struggle. You're either winning or losing, and there is no in between."
"Got this thing because many reviews compared it to X-COM and said the story was compelling. Sure, it's like X-COM but watered down to the point where there is absolutely no challenge or tension. The story, what I saw of it, is typical anime fluff with no substance and saturated with groan worthy melodrama. I suppose if you like anime and simple games, this is the game for you. If not, steer clear, and ignore the mouth breathers who hold this up as some kind of deep tactical game."
"I was expecting a strategy game but this game doesn't give you enough information to be able to use any strategy. You can't even see the movement ranges of your own units. You're stuck just guessing and hoping they have enough stamina to get where you want them to go, turning the game into a frustrating trial-and-error ordeal instead of strategizing."
"I have a love/hate relationship with this game. I started with loving it but the downsides have become so gratingly obvious and annoying, I can hardly bear playing it now. I won't go into details, there are so many nonsensical issues, drawbacks and downright bizarre game mechanics that it would be tedious to list them all.   Just please read the top negative reviews, they've hit it spot on. Only put this up to balance out the fanbois' ludicrous overpraising of this fairly ancient PS3 port.  Worth getting in a Humble Bundle just to try out; if you have incredible patience and a lot of time to stare at the same images, over &amp; over again, you might find some enjoyment.  Personally, it's put me off JRPGs of this type completely..."
"I want to recommend, VC and even though I will likely finish it, I can't say I'd tell others to buy it without a few caveats.  The story is pretty solid, but I feel like most of the time the voice actors didn't realize they were in scenes where kids were getting gunned down because they seem no more upset about it then if they'd just run out of ketchup. However my major issues are in the mechanics.  This game is the most punishing strategy game I have played since company of heros and not because of difficulty but because of questionable design. I feel I'm more then qualified to say that as I've played a number of turn bases and real time strategy games in my time.  Move your unit the wrong direction? No going back.  Select the wrong unit? Too bad. Like to play conservatively? Tuff, time is key in scoring. See that waist high wall? Shame you were only trained to used sandbags and trenches(the only hard cover I've seen so far) as cover.  However the real bugger of it all comes in 2 problems. 1. Cutscenes before and during battle(along with tutorials) are unskipible. 2. Enemies are given the same rules as you, I'll explain why this is a problem.  First the cutscenes problem, the missions are often designed in such a way that you have to fail once(or more) to know where to put your units and even what unit composition to have. This means sitting though cutscenes and tutorials until you get it right, a large chunk of time is spend doing this and even though there is an option on failure to 'restart battle' you will not be allowed to change your units no will you be able to skip cutscenes. If you are going to make a game this punishing, there should be a restart button that just resets the board. Half way though a mission an invincible unit that could take out one of my units in a single attack appeared, after a struggle to figure out how to achieve the objective for about an hour, this unit just waltzed in and Game Over.   So the 'rules problem,' any time scout units, assault units or tanks are not being directly controlled, they are in 'overwatch' meaning they will fire on anything they can see, even things they cannot damage. If you select a character who is standing eye to eye with say an assault unit, the exact moment you take control that unit will be under a hail of gunfire. This fire continues until you take an action or find cover. On top of that if you choose to attack but fail to finish off the unit you are attacking, they get a counter attack.  Now why is this unfair? The AI controlled units can make split second decisions, they don't push the wrong button, aren't subject to the units odd momentum, don't have the negative character traits and are often a bit tougher then your own units. So while you are trying to play, you are under this constant pressure worst of all, there is no way (that I could see) to look at the field between turns and plan out the next step.  I've seen the AI make choices so quickly that my own units didn't have time to even line up a shot while in overwatch and if they do connect it's only because the enemy was attempting to rush and throw a grenade. Yes on top of everything else, the AI will rush you. These problems are most damning in the first few missions of the game when you are forced to walk across a street in broad daylight under gunfire from a tank rather then backtracking down a safe alleyway you've just cleared.  There are a few other gripes but these are the few that keep me from recommending it off hand. I hope that they have fixed some of these issues in further installments as this series has great potential I feel and I'm glad to see Sega not afraid to port some of their true Gems."
"Completly linear game, dull and naive narration.  After 20 hours in the game i felt i was running a squad of pupils and late teenagers. Very slow pace, you need to go through much uninteresting cutscene before playing. It is more an 'interacting movie' than a game, and a bad one.  Unfriendly ergonomy, it is seen it is a console port, with redundant actions in menus and so on. No autosave.  Zero tactical challenge.  Clunky tank control (the tank hit box makes it bump most world object, and makes you loosing a lot of AP). AI is not challenging at all. Also sometime the game reset the position of the squad when a cutscene is fired, to place them in predefined locations for the next part of the scenario! Or 'immortal' units that can die only after another cutscene.  I think my problem with this game is cultural and generational... This game is reviewed as one of the best tactical games from console. I'm glad i dont have a console... I'd better go back to more interesting and deep tactical games that only PC can offer.  The only good thing in Valkyria is the graphics and art.  Not recommended."
"I wouldn't recommend this title based on several aspects of the games mechanics:  - This isn't a 'turn-based' strategy game as enemy combatants respond in real time while the player is limited to single actions during turns. Final Fantasy Tactics or even XCOM would be much better examples of how to effectively manage enemy reaction patterns in a strategy game. - The class/weapon leveling system is capped based on story progression. Replaying scenarios is the only means to properly equip characters prior to story missions. - Grinding in scenarios is as awfully repetitive as it is boring. You often are required to keep fighting the same scenario on the same map with the same objectives before gaining enough experience to level your units. - Units are leveled as a whole class and not as an individual character. This makes each character feel disposable in a setting where everyone is supposed to matter.  Overall, the game is overly repetitive with little/no rewards to keep a player coming back for more with an awkward learning curve to boot. There are a lot of tropes that are forced into the narrative to give life to the characters but it falls short with the feel of copy/paste writing."
"The story didn't grab me at all. A combination of cheesy dialog, slow gameplay, annoying protagonist and for some reason a pregnant woman thrown in has me unable to bother continue this game even past chapter one."
"Pros: +Unique blend of turn based strategy and 3rd person shooter  ++Balanced and well thought out class system  +A nice variety of different characters to choose for your squad, each with their own strengths and weaknesses  +Some clever plot twists where just when you think you had everything predicted right from the start, you're thrown a curveball  +Kawaii artstyle  Cons: --Beyond ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI: See it activating the same unit over and over again only to run from one pile of sandbags to the next and back again. See it ending their AT soldier's turn when he could obviously end the game with one easy shot. Seriously, I had so many situations where I only survived because the AI was just too polite to finish me off (Imagine if at the end of Super Mario, you won because bowser just didn't attack you)  -RNG: The reason why even though the AI uses an anti-tank weapon against your covered scout, it might well succeed.  --Trial&amp;Error: At the later missions, I basically only started with scouts in my first try to even know what my surroundings looked like/what scripted stuff I got thrown in my face (The mission that made me conclusively ragequit kept spawning enemies which you never could be ready for. And no, not with some space in between so you can prepare. Right in your face, so you can kiss your ♥♥♥ goodbye, baby.) This is a recurring problem. Often, your first go at a mission will go down the drain because you just didn't have enough information which subsequently makes your second try way too easy more often than not, as now you know every enemy's position thanks to the predictable AI and the linear levels  -Unskippable cutscenes and enemy unit activations: Seems like a small point, but the last thing you want to do after you've failed a mission numerous times, is watch the same cutscene and several minutes of the AI 'doing its thing', inbetween your turns  -Main character you just want to punch in the face repeatedly: He's basically your typical naively-romantic anime hero who reacts to everything with 'BUT NATURE THO!!!' (infuriating)  -As far as menues go, they were really lazy with the PC port. You have a book with chapter markings on the side. No, you don't click those marks to select a chapter. You press F to bring up the menu, use arrow-keys to open another menu, then from there you may select the chapter, you dirty peasant  -Some minor bugs and annoyances: You can't hit enemies if you're standing too close, because bullets will spawn behind them. A few environment objects have ♥♥♥♥ed hitboxes which deflect your grenades or eat your shots. Sometimes your dead soldiers can be seen running around in circles instead of lying around while the camera zooms out (okay I admit, this might be a plus)  -Kawaii artstyle (This is a war game ffs)  Conclusion: If they had opted for more open levels with more room to maneuver in and had programmed an actual AI, instead of pipeline levels and the digital version of a demented ape flinging manure everywhere, the battles would have been more dynamic, requiring you to actually use your brain for different things than memorizing. Maybe, this game would even have had the potential for a classic for some people. But all in all: Just a tad too much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to get a recommendation. If you don't mind this kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, go for it anyway."
"Do you enjoy carefully planning your attacks, meticulously placing your units, skillfully moving them around the battlefield, and then watching them completely miss their targets from point blank range?  Do you enjoy playing only one class, sprinting invulnerable across the battlefield while your commander in a tank shouts orders, lobbing grenades and firing off headshots while the rest of your squad is essentially useless?  Do you enjoy repeating missions over and over hoping for the random number generator to spit out the results you need, all the while watching obnoxious and paper thin dialogue which you can only partially skip?  Then this game is for you!   So much potential...wasted. A lot of great things about this game, and the worst part is I really want to like it..,but it just gets painful, see above, when a strategy game becomes about saving and loading and playing one class."
"There is some kind of conflict in this game with the mechanics,i,e the controls.Im not prepared to remove my HOTAS and Other controllers to play this properly with a Mouse+Kb,you cant leave everything in and expect it to work.you get this mad spinning??i know now its because i have xbox controller plugged in,thats fine that can be unplugged by just pulling it out,but my Warthog is a diffrent story all together,so if you play other games,which most of us do then be prepared to unplug everything so you can play this without spinning!.Im Uninstalling mine,plus i couldnt get to grip with the controls(spinning doesnt help)so after an hour of messing around thats enough for me.Struggle to understand why the japanese build games that play this way?when they can do it so many other ways that are proven to work,and simple enough to pick up and play instantly,this is NOT.Shame really,dont be fooled by the high % i was....and found out that i was soon to be disapointed and realsied i just wasted my £14.99....again."
"I was hoping for story, with some tactical game play. I got both, but I feel like the game is aimed at a younger audience, or that it was very intentionally kept almost 'dumbed down'. The characters and feel of the game are utterly un-immersive because of the strange, cutesy feel to all the interactions (very Asian.. :P)   I feel like yes there have been some serious moments in this game, that might have pulled at heart strings, which were ruined by the intrusion of again, the same two dimensional characters with bland story telling. The formatting is like a comic book which totally removes you from the game and feels like you're playing through a very limited linear comic book where you play out certain scenarios.. the AI seems to behave the same way each time you retry, too, which gives a bit of an unrealistic feel.  I'm going to give this game another chance soon but thus far I'm utterly bored and not drawn to the story or characters. Good luck, but my advise is don't bother, many better story games out there, and don't bother paying full price if you want a serious story, or characters you might get attached to."
"I really want to love this game. I do, but I just couldn't do it.  What you may ask, is the problem? Especially considering the majority of positive reviews, well let me tell you. PACING. By Cthulhu, this game is slower than hell and boring to boot. Don't get me wrong I was 4 chapters in and when I actually got to 'play' I loved every minute of it, but the sheer fact that I have to click 6 seperate cutscenes just to get to 1 playable section in the chapter was beyond annoying and ruined any fun I was having. Maybe to some this wasn't a problem and maybe it gets better later on, but I won't keep trudging through to find out."
Initially fun this game turns out to be a puzzler (instead of a tactical game) about how to rush missions by abusing game mechanics to get the fastest completion time.
"Not recommened as 'tactical turnbased' RPG. The game isnt turnbased at all ... its an action shooter, inside a graphics novel. The game isnt tactical at all either, its more the savespam kind, where you learn by try and error how the enemy moves and place your units after the 15th try in the right places. The reason therefor is, that the enemy has unlimeted amount of actions during your turn, and you have unlimeted amount of actions during his turn. So all ist about placing your units in a way, that they make optimal use of this ridiculous stupid mechanism. Boring ...  Besides the game has a reward system that only rewards rushing ... so the best way to play it in most cases is take one scout, yes ONE of your 34567 chars (which are totally useless most time) and rush the whole map with him, while the others just wait at the starting point ...  Boring ... Cant recomend it, even beside its very beautyful graphics and a real good story (well I guess the story is good, only went through the first 3 chapters ... until then it is good and made very proffessional ). But as a graphics novel it has to much action, as a Shooter it has not enough action and as a tactical or strategical game its useless. The RPG Part is .... well ... meh ... but there.  But perhaps I just cant judge this cause I did not play long enough.  All in all ... if you are looking for a turnbased, tactical game play Underrail, Xcom, Jagged Alliance ... or Shadowrun ... or Wasteland. There are many games out there which make a 10 times better job as a tactical turnbased RPG then this one ...  If you want a kind of Action Graphic Novel with nice anime chars and a solid story, professionally executed ... then buy. Otherwise .... dont."
"Just had to rage quit, mortars doing no damage to enemies despite landing on their heads, snipers missing from like 10 feet away, anti-tank shots going through a tank to deal no damage, that's the kind of crap you had to deal with in this game, Impossible not to rage out when you spend 40 minutes in a match, and have close ♥♥♥ matches you lose due to total bull-$^^^. In no sanity could I recommend this game to anyone."
"This game would be great if it wasn't from the wierdly mixed combat system. You move attack on a turn-based way while the enemy shoots at you on a real-time way, then vice-versa. This causes lots of situations unfair for whoever's turn it is, as leaving an unit in plain sight can end up safer than taking control of it and moving it back to cover. Maybe it's just me that's uncompatible with this kind of game, but if you play it, keep that in mind: You are lot stronger in defence than in attack.  Also, for some reason, the game uses a different save folder depending if you are connected to Steam or not. You might end up having to move your save file from time to time."
"terrible console port with worse controls and gameplay mechanics i've ever seen!   sadly kills any enjoyment one may get from the wonderful story, graphics and sounds  so forget trying play with keyboard and mouse, best get xbox 360 controller!"
This game is kind of like X Com except without much of a challenge. It has a lot of Anime story line stuffed into it. Like more story than game. Maybe you like anime. You'll probably like this game then. Maybe you're brain is developed enough to want a better thought out story with less of a microcosm going on and characters behaving in reasonable adult ways. You probably wouldn't like this game. Did you like the difficulty of Final Fantasy Tactics advanced or in general do you like tactical games where your palm never touches your face? This is about the right challenge. Do you enjoy your mistakes having terrible consequences? Then you probably wouldn't like this game.
"This game was made for a console and they didn't give enough of a crap to make proper PC menu controls. What is start? Left click? Enter? Sometimes it's one, sometimes it's the other.  Being unable to restart a mission from the menu is absolutely demented. If you want to restart a mission, you need to blow up your own tank.  The save system is awkward. You have to constantly save after every mission. If you are getting frustrated by a mission and want to quit, you'll lose everything since the last save. Didn't bring an engineer on a mission where you find out that half your squad is on the other side of a broken bridge? Well, I hope you saved because there's no way to exit the mission and pick a new squad without reloading.  Finally, the tank controls are atrocious at best. Pressing back makes it hook left? Pressing left makes it go forward? What the hell? The best I can figure, is back+left is reverse.   I want to like this game, but it has so many quality of life issues that it's much too frustrating."
"if a story book made wanna be rpg with horrible physics and aiming mechanics is what your into then this is for you but otherwise id stay away  the art work is great the story well it isnt the worste ive seen , it is nowhere near as customizable as they advertized it as bieng .there really isnt a whole lot of tactics involved in combat if you have recent upgrades and arnt an idiot and rush into the middle of thier base you will win i havnt lost a fight yet on any difficulty hell ive even made challenges like only use tank or my fav was only used 1 sniper 1 eng and the tank went thru quarter of the game like that the ai is horrid they use the same damn strategy every friggen map. also there is something really wrong when you can sneak up behind someone and point blank to the back of the head empty a whole clip into someones head and they live WTF C'MON ppl it dosnt matter if you wearing a helmet or not point blank to the head you WILL DIE dont believe me go strap on a bandana , beret or knights helm and and shoot it and see what happens... also sadly the snipers miss the most wtf is up with that cezary averaged 4 out of 10 hits wtf hes a ♥♥♥♥en sniper yet has ♥♥♥♥ poor aim and only 1.8 times the range of the machinegun and 8 out of ten times even if it saws 1 shot to kill it missed or it hits and the mofo lives arg so infuriating and it happenes to all the classes at all ranges the dif between bieng closer is miniscule unless right in face and even then still miss a good bit overall its not the worse game ive plaed in my almost 30 years of gaming but i cant bring myself to recomeend it sorry folks maybe if it was on sale for like 5 bucks but otherwise dont bother there are hundreds even thousands of games better than this"
"I agree 100% with this so here:  One of the worst and poorly designed turned-based strategy games I have ever played. The cons are as follows: an uninspired story, cheesy after-school special level dialogue, tedious unskippable cut scenes, horrible collision detection (your character will just run in place at various different locations), clunky movement, and really terrible level design. If you want to play a great turn-based rpg with this type of gameplay, do yourself a favor and play XCOM. I honestly have no idea why this game has gotten the level of praise that it has."
Turn based strategy where you only have a few seconds to think of each move? Pass.
"Valkyria Chronicles is a fantastically innovative game, with beautiful character design, an innovative and really enjoyable combat system, and an interesting if slightly worn storyline.  So why do I say to avoid it? Character work. The game wants to tell a character-driven story, then can't help creating a series of one-note characters who require the work of one particular supporting character to hold up.   And if you are going to do that, there should be only one commandment: Thou shalt not kill thine only interesting character for any reason.  "
"Feels like I'm watching a very slow-paced and boring anime, interspersed with a pointless first-person tactics battle format. 90% of the game seems to be contained in a comic-style format where you watch clips instead of actually playing the game during that time (That's how they convey the story).  Your aim doesn't matter since it's all based on positioning. Basically it's turn-based, but they tried to simulate it as real-time. And I don't think it works nearly as well if they had gone full turn-based, or full real-time.   It's also brutal that the story cutscenes can only be skipped and not fast-forwarded through. (Are you serious?)  Leaving this review since all these very positive reviews convinced me to buy the game, and it did not live up to the hype for me."
"Really? This game is a piece of crap, I've been robbed. Cheesy video (cerca 1990) horrible graphics, this game is a 1.5 outta ten, any game is better than this"
"typical anime game. Girls with high voice and stereo character, an innocent, good looking guy and his sister, a war with no casualties or horror but lot of chances for heroism. Story is okay if you just want to kick up your feet and watch an anime, just dont expect any complexity or twists. Gameplay is rather poor. You have to watch a tons of episode and click through a lot of dialog before you get into battle. And the battle itself is really boring since you can not adjust the difficulty level and the game is obviously made for anime fans who doesnt play lot of video games. compared to jagged alliance or x-com you just rush and gun down enemy with your immortal cute girl army in valkyria chronicles with no tacticle needed what so ever. though you can make battle more interesting by setting up additional objects by yourself like trying to finish the battle with no one getting shoot at or ending the battle in less than 5 turns ect. But the game doesnt give you any credits for doing so and it will not alter the story. In fact you can not alter the story in anyway or make story changing decision or decision at all. Last negativ point: the game has no auto save. I doubt anyone need it but if you buy and play this game remember to manuell save before exiting the game. I rate this game 4/10 and recommend for anime fans to buy it on steamsales. None anime fan who want to play turn based strat. game, this is not for you."
"This game is utterly deprived of strategic gameplay for one single reason: your reward is based upon how fast you can complete a level. Forget about flanking your enemy, covering, preserving soldiers, taking advantage of each unit's distinctive abilities or anything that actually resembles strategy. From the start you are encouraged to choose the unit with most HP and run towards the enemy like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 5 year old, flapping your arms, taking damage and then shooting one specific enemy unit point blank in the face. If you try to avoid damage, cover, take advantage of all your soldiers, ambush the enemy or anything of the sorts you'll be rewarded less xp. That's it.  Eventually I suppose you'll be forced to balance this frantic speed run with minimal survivability, but nevertheless it is a game about warfare and strategy that plays like kindergarten simulator."
"Thought this might be a fun time-waster. Nope. It's a typical Japanese 'crush their spirits unless they have l33t n1nj4 powerz' grinder.  This would probably boring as hell for those who are geniuses at Japanese gaming, and impossibly frustrating for everyone else. No thanks, Sega.  The anime's okay, though."
"Click button, wtach cut scene, click button watch another cut scene, click button, watch cut scene, click, watch, click.... a fight! Yey.... win, click, watch, click watch cut scene, hope for a fight, click, watch, click, fight.  This game is more about watching cut scenes than playing a game. The turn based strategy fights are interestingly novel, but not enouggh to make an entire game."
"Crashed after an alt+tab, only to find out that it does not auto save your progress. And this is not a game that respects your time. Everything you do takes forever, especially with unskippable cutscenes and tutorials in the missions, so replaying from the start was not an appealing idea.   There is a ridiculous amount of cutscenes, and while the non-mission related ones are skippable, you still have to start playing them before you can proceed to the next chapter. Not so great for people who aren't playing to see the anime story.   Controls were ported lazily. 'Press Start' is the first instruction I see, but there's no Start button on my keyboard. The UI has no mouse support in many places and the buttons to use are not set according to the PC Master Race ISO standards.  Having said that, the gameplay itself was pretty good, if you can tolerate the slow, inefficient controls."
"Yet another poor console port, when will I learn."
"This used to be my absolute favorite game growing up.   I'm a huge fan of Hitoshi Sakimoto's musical work, I found the messages in the game endearing, I loved the heavy story elements that made me have a relationship with every character. I even enjoyed the sharp difficulty curves and the punishing DLCs that came out. This was one of the few games I played to 100% on the PS3.   Coming back to it again, It doesn't hold up. I think the biggest issue is that VC is a game that DOES NOT want to be PLAYED but rather WATCHED. It takes so long to perform a series of actions.   For example, say I just want to move a character (not attack, just move) three times. I have to go through a selection menu, a dialog prompt, a zoom in transition, then I move once, then a menu confirms if I want to end my turn, then I watch an ending animation, zoom out, I'm back at the selection screen--I click the same character again, dialoge prompt, I zoom in again, I move the character (a shorter distance this time), confirm I'm done moving the character, closing animation, zoom out, selection screen, pick the character for the third and last time, dialouge prompt, zoom in, move character (just a few steps forward by this point), confirm I want to end my turn, closing animation, zoom out, and finally I'm back at the selection screen.   All of that just to move in a straight line? Three times?  It's only now do I realize how terribly designed that was--especially for a game that's come out after other tactical games and franchises such as FF:Tactics, XCOM, Advanced Wars, etc.   I guess, at the time, I was more won over with the anime-astetic than I was with the actual gameplay. In retrospect, I only remembered enjoying the story and relating to the messages of fighting for peace as an underdog.  But even the story in upon critical review makes me frustrated.   For example, Galia is played to be an underdog protecting it's own land from two much more powerful forces (The Empire and the Federation) that are in conflict with each other. However, the status quo in Galia before the Empire even invaded was essentially a country that was openly racist against it's indigenous people, the Darcsens, who were wrongly blamed for the actions of the invading Valkyria, who brought the ragnite technology to Europe and ultimately cultivated actions the great wars told in this stories anthology. The Valkyria are baiscally the root cause of this entire mess, they're the emotional antagonists, yet they're worshiped as gods/royalty by Gallians and no one ever exposes the truth to the world by the end of the game. The entire crux of Galia's culture is a fraud and it's only made more severe when it's revealed (spoilers.....) that the leader of Galia is actually a Darcsen who was part of a tribe the double crossed it's own people for power. That's just sours my impression of the team I'm fighting for. The Empire is 'evil' but at least they're straight forward about it. 'We want what you have because we're more powerful than you.' The Federation is shown to be underhanded with their politics, trying to kidnap Galia's sitting regeant. But Galia's even worse for worshiping a race that destroyed the lands, subjugated it's indignous people, forced a traiter tribe to rule over everyone, does NOTHING to improve race relations since, perfectly happy to lie to it's people as they draft younger and younger citezens to march to their death (Squads 6 and 8 of the Galia militia are utterly obliterated--and the Valk with comedically large boobs literally obliterates the entire standing Galia military), hides weapons of mass destruction in their towers (Valkof), all while propagating themselves as this innocent bunch of people that like bugs and bake bread. It's like. Dude. We may not be the bad guys, but we suck worse that everyone else.   Also... ugh, now I'm just venting. But the story really goes off the deep end once the supernatural elements are thrown in. I loved the minor tank on tank battles, but once Selvaria (the big boob Valk) comes into the picture it just becomes... dumb. It's like all the more subtle elements of the warfare completly fall the wayside. It's like, before we were charmed with the concept of Isara building a plane and Alicia planting flowers in a time of war with nothing but rifles, a single tank, and a band of spunky misfits--then out of nowhere there's this giant slug like tank/train that can mow down an entire forrest and carries a giant lance that blows mountains apart and on top of it is a SUPER Valkyria and you have to use your Valkyria to punch a hole in the tank so you can take down the Super Valkyria on the top. It's so stupid. What happened to the charming Europe-envisioned alteranate universe I was playing in? When did this become this terrible Japanese sci fi land where all physics are out of the window?  This is coming off as a rant, but if I were to conclude, I would say that the gameplay itself tragically breaks at around the same time the story jumps the shark. The first time I got angry was when I was doing a mission, using my tactics, having a good time, and then the Valk shows up, mid-mission, and the only recourse I had was to reload saved games and save after every move (save scrum) just to get through the mission. It just added to the number of menus I had to go through and I felt a bit cheated because the dynamics of an overpowered enemy Valk that I am NOT ALLOWED to defeat because of STORY ruined the careful tactics I had prepared at the start of the mission.   But whatever, I moved on to the next mission... and soon I'm having fun again until the Valk shows up again and now I'm ready to beat her but the STORY will NOT ALLOW me to beat her for BECAUSE, so I have to suffice with hitting her with tank shells over and over again until a CUTSCENE defeats her for me. Now I'm getting angry. It's like my fun game is getting lame on purpose.  Then my next Valk mission is that Alicia becomes an over powered Valk, and I'm like, okay, cool. But the game won't let me use her to shoot down enemies... Okay. And I just have to sit and watch while the game has fun playing with my scouts... Okay. Oh, and by the way, this whole mission was a trap and your surrounded now. Well at least I have my Valk right? WRONG. OH SCREW YOU GAME--look what you did?! You put me into this position where I have to watch you put me into a trap and then watch me get out while you remove the only key to get me out? Who could figure out this mission on their first time--after watching all of those intermissions of Alicia slowly walking and killing enemies on her own. How the hell was I supposed to know that you'd sick a never ending stream of enemy fodder at me and take away my Valk mid mission? NOW I HAVE TO SAVE SCRUM AND REWATCH THIS WHOLE SEQUENCE just to make up for your inability to properly inform me of how you changed the games rules. The objective of that mission was to claim the base--now it's destroy two tanks? I don't even have lancers out--ugh, what a terribly designed mission.   Every mission with a Valk friggin suuuuuuucks. Even Ghirlandio sucks, when you kill the Selvaria--no, I'm sorry, THE GAME WON'T LET YOU 'KILL' SELVARIA. Even if she kills hords of your own squad, even if you surround her with stormtroopers and take pot shots at her head over and over again, even if that was the MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE MISSION, no the game won't let you kill her because then you'd get in the way of the STORY. Ugh, such a terrible mission. It puts the priorities of PLOT higher than the gameplay incentives of the player. It's like if Mario beats bowser and Toad is like, 'Sorry, Mario. The Princess is in this castle, but you can't save her right now because she's going to save herself in cutscene. So... good job making it this far.'  I can't recommend this game anymore.    "
"They main thing that bothers me about the game is that I don't have anime sensibilities. I'm not talking about the look, but rather, about all characters being grotesquely childish, naive, and having one-dimensional personalities, with conversations which are terribly cliche and unrealistic.  Beyond that, the tactical gameplay is nice, but could do with significantly more intel, so that the player won't need to guess what to expect in his first playthrough of each mission. This is especially true for missions with invisible lines that once are crossed some event, such as enemy reinforcement, happens."
"Pros:  *Moderately interesting setting, though slightly spoiled by the inclusion of magical anime silliness. *Unique combat system; one of the only SRPGs not to use the sword and sorcery setting, and as a result it manages to get above the traditional tank-and-spank of Pillars of Eternity or Fire Emblem.  Cons: *Hugely annoying anime tropes (why does my CO care that I have a flying pig pet? Doesn't she have a war to be fighting?) *Anime nonsense about the power of friendship; this works in games like Persona because you talk to the characters and get to know them, but here nobody has any dialog outside of prescripted cutscenes and combat, so I genuinely don't care about them *Attempts to do an anime style story about the horrors of war fall flat. Maybe it's just because I've played Spec Ops: The Line, but I found the attempts to render 'the horrors of war' in this story genuinely laughable. *Unique combat system is horribly gamey and incourages silly tactics like spamming all your movement on a couple of scouts to run into the enemy base from behind and 'capture' it, thus magically winning *Story missions are horribly balanced. There are usually only a couple of routes that will lead to victory, and you have to either save-scum or rely on trial and error  If you're REALLY desperate for an SRPG I guess this one is OK, but be warned -- the only fun you will have with the combat is during the skirmish battles. Aside from that, be prepared for a lot of walkthrough reading."
"This used to be my absolute favorite game growing up.   I'm a huge fan of Hitoshi Sakimoto's musical work, I found the messages in the game endearing, I loved the heavy story elements that made me have a relationship with every character. I even enjoyed the sharp difficulty curves and the punishing DLCs that came out. This was one of the few games I played to 100% on the PS3.   Coming back to it again, It doesn't hold up. I think the biggest issue is that VC is a game that DOES NOT want to be PLAYED but rather WATCHED. It takes so long to perform a series of actions.   For example, say I just want to move a character (not attack, just move) three times. I have to go through a selection menu, a dialog prompt, a zoom in transition, then I move once, then a menu confirms if I want to end my turn, then I watch an ending animation, zoom out, I'm back at the selection screen--I click the same character again, dialoge prompt, I zoom in again, I move the character (a shorter distance this time), confirm I'm done moving the character, closing animation, zoom out, selection screen, pick the character for the third and last time, dialouge prompt, zoom in, move character (just a few steps forward by this point), confirm I want to end my turn, closing animation, zoom out, and finally I'm back at the selection screen.   All of that just to move in a straight line? Three times?  It's only now do I realize how terribly designed that was--especially for a game that's come out after other tactical games and franchises such as FF:Tactics, XCOM, Advanced Wars, etc.   I guess, at the time, I was more won over with the anime-astetic than I was with the actual gameplay. In retrospect, I only remembered enjoying the story and relating to the messages of fighting for peace as an underdog.  But even the story in upon critical review makes me frustrated.   For example, Galia is played to be an underdog protecting it's own land from two much more powerful forces (The Empire and the Federation) that are in conflict with each other. However, the status quo in Galia before the Empire even invaded was essentially a country that was openly racist against it's indigenous people, the Darcsens, who were wrongly blamed for the actions of the invading Valkyria, who brought the ragnite technology to Europe and ultimately cultivated actions the great wars told in this stories anthology. The Valkyria are baiscally the root cause of this entire mess, they're the emotional antagonists, yet they're worshiped as gods/royalty by Gallians and no one ever exposes the truth to the world by the end of the game. The entire crux of Galia's culture is a fraud and it's only made more severe when it's revealed (spoilers.....) that the leader of Galia is actually a Darcsen who was part of a tribe the double crossed it's own people for power. That's just sours my impression of the team I'm fighting for. The Empire is 'evil' but at least they're straight forward about it. 'We want what you have because we're more powerful than you.' The Federation is shown to be underhanded with their politics, trying to kidnap Galia's sitting regeant. But Galia's even worse for worshiping a race that destroyed the lands, subjugated it's indignous people, forced a traiter tribe to rule over everyone, does NOTHING to improve race relations since, perfectly happy to lie to it's people as they draft younger and younger citezens to march to their death (Squads 6 and 8 of the Galia militia are utterly obliterated--and the Valk with comedically large boobs literally obliterates the entire standing Galia military), hides weapons of mass destruction in their towers (Valkof), all while propagating themselves as this innocent bunch of people that like bugs and bake bread. It's like. Dude. We may not be the bad guys, but we suck worse that everyone else.   Also... ugh, now I'm just venting. But the story really goes off the deep end once the supernatural elements are thrown in. I loved the minor tank on tank battles, but once Selvaria (the big boob Valk) comes into the picture it just becomes... dumb. It's like all the more subtle elements of the warfare completly fall the wayside. It's like, before we were charmed with the concept of Isara building a plane and Alicia planting flowers in a time of war with nothing but rifles, a single tank, and a band of spunky misfits--then out of nowhere there's this giant slug like tank/train that can mow down an entire forrest and carries a giant lance that blows mountains apart and on top of it is a SUPER Valkyria and you have to use your Valkyria to punch a hole in the tank so you can take down the Super Valkyria on the top. It's so stupid. What happened to the charming Europe-envisioned alteranate universe I was playing in? When did this become this terrible Japanese sci fi land where all physics are out of the window?  This is coming off as a rant, but if I were to conclude, I would say that the gameplay itself tragically breaks at around the same time the story jumps the shark.

"Do NOT get this game. This is a port from a console. The issue? There is no mouse support in the menus, and using the mouse with the tanks leads to glitches that I ran into that turned a battle I was winning to a one hit loss. If you want to play this game, do yourself some justice, get it on the console."
Would be great if it didn't crash for no reason after 2 hours.
"A utterly boring game... It hurt my eyes because of the misty effect around the edge and the whole games soft tones were awful. I know yo can adjust the colouring and whatever on a montior, but I'm not doing it for one game.  The game itself is a little sore for wear. The models are haunting doll-like and I have trouble imagine these kids ever have been in a fight let alone a war when you first see them. I now Japan promotes youth culture, but it really doesn't always work. And the 3rd person perspective for units when your works against some of the game. You can't always see where your going and you're POV is restricted by a body in the way. This is the problem with 3rd person and moving.   Overall, the games first impressions right now is 'lacking.'  The game itself is polished overall and its merchanics at almost impressive for a limited concept.  I guess the storyline episods are what are making it the most boring of all. I'mleft twiddling my thumbs for too long. again I know you can skip, but you shouldn't want nor need to. But the characters are static a lot of scenes and in others a scene goes on too long or there is too much of the storyline. Its better when the story and game are the same and not seperate, sort of like Bioshock (first game that came into my head). I know its a different genre, but story telling shouldn't mean it breaks the flow of gameplay.  Edit: Also some advane for others writing negaltive reviews of this game; look at my post. As of wrting this warning its '1 of 7 people found this review helpful'. This is one of those games where if you write something negative, fanboys will ote down your post.   You have been warned, the fanboys don't like nagative reviews."
First game i officially got a refund for
Was not well ported
"I'll summarize my feelings about this game in a couple of points: -Gameplay is slow and unsatisfying. If you are a fan of turn-based strategies like fallout, silent storm, jagged alliance, this is not your game. -Heavy reliance on cutscenes. Now I tolerate anime to a degree, but I think even fans of this genre will will not be able to tolerate this stuff. -Clunky menus. -No meaningful weapon upgrades system. -No unit progression. 'All units have the same experience and training so you can swap them out whenever you like without the fear' - that is presented as a feature.  3/10, would not recommend."
"This game, while exactly the type of game I like to play, is ridiculous and unforgiving. Multiple tries on chapter 14 have made it unfun and I quit. I gave it a fair shot, too, putting in over 50 hours of gameplay."
"Well Well Well...what do we have here? a 2008 PS3 ported game, yeah? Eeeh i know what you think, you think RE4 and RE5, both are atrocious ports.  I would not agree more. this game has a very complicated interface (not that it looks like that, but because menus are not click and go, some classical keybindings are reversed...it's pretty tho, many good things and typical funny japanese logic. I Would endorese this game if it did not suffer that much for it's port.  oh, funny! if you have units tha like each other, the may shoot all at once. if they dont, they wont. yeah logic. ♥♥♥♥ING logic. out of five aiming at one, three scouts shoot and hit an ennemy, one does not, the last shoots thought a wall. also, dodging animation is mixed with prone position, which cannot be toggled on. so an ennemy/ally who dodges slams on the ground while the shooter keeps shooting straight. LOOOL.  ////////////////////////POTENTIAL SPOILERS\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ////////////////////////POTENTIAL SPOILERS\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ////////////////////////POTENTIAL SPOILERS\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  -you cant toggle croutch/sprint on your troops.  -automatic response to an attack is plain weird, sometimes the attacker gets one-shot some others, your characters just stands there doing nothing and taking hits...  -tank controls are atrocious, think Saint Row 3's tank with a little bit of unwanted fantasy in the tank moves, ala borderlands, add to this an atrocious accuracy for a 'top notch' tank...  -the difficulty to understand how far your soldier can go, especially on lengthy trips to catch back the front, every class has it's own range, which can be very frustrating, since YOUR sniper cant do more than 50m per round, where your anti tank unit does 70m, your assault unit does 90m and your scouts up to 200m.  ennemies have clearly different rules, their snipers are far more polyvalent.  Also, damage decreases a lot from range, let's say that 'IF' you can hit with your sniper past 100m there is great chances you will see an ennemy head require 5 shots to give up.   Even so with the tank, a 85mm(!) AP round seems unable to mangle/shred/tear an ennemy assault unit!   I can relate that AT units are tuff stuff, but still...3 AP rounds or two mortar hits at 60m get a kill the same way a single machinegun burst does at 30m, if the ennemy has the stones to attack within the MG's range. yeah so it means 6AP (full round is 9AP at the point of my game) *OR* two rounds (One mortar shell per round) *OR* wait for an ennemy to come and attack the tank (which it only does away from Mg range).   So yeah it can be played, it has difficulty levels, but expect difficulty spikes along the way.  Graphically, it'saverage, Story is average, Gameplay is good when you dont face the said issues... yeah, bad.  One TIP: NEVER RUSH THE VIDEOS TO THE BATTLES, it can get you stuck in a fight...you need to go each time to the casern, and level up your stuff. it may be cheesy on some moments, but....What you pay is what you get.  @17 euros the game (jumped on the pre-sales train), it's barely, very barely endorsed. graphics save the game, for sure. i recommand waiting for it to be on sales, it's worth 10-or-less euros, not 18.   /Edit finished the game. the storyline fishtails like crazy, nevermind the atrocious difficulty spikes that rise on the seven last missions and the obvious technological holes the game has. (wtf autoloader cannon against pre WW2 layouts, perma spam ennemies, no overwatch for your units...no planes and invisible gallian army (nowhere to be seen, before and after the valkyria episode) and an unicorn hero that stops an empire with a tank that cannot hit another at 20M! overall, the accuracy of the tank ingame is 85% for the ennemy, less than 70% for your two tanks. and the second one is WEAK. worse, it cannot be removed from the loadout. seriously, when an ennemy can survive a 105mm mortar direct hit, what is the point of having a tank in first place?     beyond mission 7, the game becomes completely annoying, easy to the point of being boooring or unplayable without internet help.... and sniper class becomes gradually useless, as the scouts range increase."
"I am honestly surprised at how many glowing reviews this game has. Maybe it is because the port was well done, which I can agree on, since it felt like it was made for PC. I did not like the game itself.  The story is horrible. It's the most sophomoric thing I've ever seen. It's like watching a really bad anime. It's completely naive, unrealistic, and makes me truly hate the main characters. It's like Michael Jackson got together with the creators of Barney and the Teletubbies, each chewed up lithium and Prozac, and then collaborated on an anti-war picture book for dementia patients.  Let me explain. I really don't mind a bad story -- FFV had a bad story, my favorite pvp games have NO story, etc. The problem is that Valkyria tries to have a good story, they take you away from the gameplay to show you slide after slide of the story, and the stupidity of the story makes you feel truly insulted as a human being.  The gameplay doesn't make up for it. The first few encounters that you try may impress you, there are some interesting mechanics in play and somewhat interesting character stats, but you tire of it quickly. The AI is either terrible or way too good, the combat has bugs, some mechanics don't make sense (dodging a sniper bullet?), and when you fail a mission due to one tiny bug or bad mechanic the rage monster takes over your body. This is because you have to start over from the beginning, and some battles can take 1-2 hours.  There is one battle in particular reviewers have mentioned here, where some super-being enters the fight towards the end of the battle and immediately wipes your team. I did not know that I was supposed to let a huge tank drive through my camps and destroy everything in order to make its radiators pop up so that I could kill it. I was defending my camps, which made the tank impervious, and as a result I lost 2 hours of my life because I didn't quite kill the super tank by the final turn. As a gamer I really like doing the best job possible, I like to apply strategy and to apply min-maxing, and so to be punished for doing a good job, in my mind, is unforgivable. It's either bad design, or worse, it assumes that its players are incompetent or stupid.  The art style is awful. I wouldn't even call it a style, it's just a Photoshop filter over the rendered graphics. It's disgusting. I really mean it. If the story didn't insult you, this will. It doesn't go away, ever.  There was a period when I first started playing the game where it was exciting. I wanted to level up my classes, recruit new snipers, see what challenges lie in the next battle. But I soon learned that this is a really bad strategy game. I barely used my brain, and when I did, it didn't seem to matter. Eventually it all turned into 'whatever.' Line up a bunch of shock troopers because they can fire on advancing enemies? Never mind, the AI goes from point A to point B asap and immediately fires, which means you rarely fire back, so 'whatever.' Use 3-4 snipers on an open-field map? Oh wait, there are invisible walls blocking half the shots, so 'whatever.'  If I had to choose between either bringing this game with me to a deserted island or a stash of diapers, I would pick the diapers, make little lancers out of my own poo, and play with those instead."

"Valkyria Chronicles is many things: creative, innovative, clever, fascinating… And yet? Not actually much fun to play. There's a tremendous amount of interesting (and mostly positive!) discussion to be had about the design, but the overall experience is dragged down by consistent frustrations. Highly recommended if you're a turn-based strategy junkie AND interested in game design AND aren't inclined towards perfectionism. Much less so if you don't intersect all three of those groups.  The core gameplay of VC is a frankly brilliant fusion of turn-based strategy with third person shooter. Each turn, you can activate units a certain number of times, with each activation letting you move the unit freely about a 3D map and line up a single volley of shots. It's intuitive while also being totally unique, and elements like terrain and return fire work in a clear, logical way. Units come in 5 classes with distinct strengths and weaknesses, and each character has their own individual features (as well as chirps and emotes) to distinguish them from others of the same class. It makes a wonderful first impression.  The game manages to be less than the sum of its parts, though. Unit upgrades are based entirely on how many turns you take to beat missions, and these requirements - especially in the early game - encourage a breakneck sprint across the map. That leads to (for example) 4 of your 10 units rushing across a map doing all the work while the other 6 sit in base, never getting used. Which is fine (kind of) except that it's also easy for a unit to be killed in a single enemy action or turn if you take a wrong step, and pinning your success on so few units makes a single death reset-worthy. The result is a fiddly, save scum-y experience as you get derailed by fluke hits/misses, surprise enemies out of the fog of war, and so on. While some blame undoubtedly lies on the player (i.e. me), the 'right' way to play is not the 'fun' way to play, and VC trains you to do the former rather than the latter.  There are other issues as well - arguably useless character classes, unreliable character abilities, characters whose special unlocks make them totally unusable, buffs that are barely ever worth their cost, a very pretty UI that is not always helpful, annoying rules surrounding attack animations, tedious and unskippable cutscenes, and more - but the game flow is definitely the biggest hiccup. If you can resist the urges to execute everything flawlessly or spend time grinding on filler content, there's lot's to appreciate. It's just a shame that the game doesn't always seem to want your love."

"The game is great, but the lack of mouse control on menus kills it for me; especially when half the game is menus. Get it on PS3, or get the PS4 remake. The PC game isn't worth it."

"First playthrough was boring, newgame+ was a little less boring, overall this game/anime is very boring with cheesy storyline dumb AI that's either OP or too easy to deal with, the enemy turns are slow/unskipable and holy ♥♥♥♥ you have to wait like 5 minutes when they get full move point.A ResidentSleeper game you can skip."
"It's frustrating to play, the lack of autosave is stupid specially paired with it crashing every once in a while. i had to go all the way to the beginning because a save file got corrupted. i heared great things about this game and i did enjoy playing it but having to start from 0 3 times in 1 day is frustrating despite the fact that i actually enjoyed the game mechanics."
I can't imagine a game more boring than this exquisitely drawn turd.
"Easily one of the worst games I have ever played. Even in the short amount of time so far the I immedatly regret buying this game.  The immese level of difficulty that you cannot change, and other issues like always having to yes everything in the menu make this game a no go.  Avoid at all costs."
"This is one difficult to judge game, on one hand I understand why it has the faults it has, on the other the things it does gets increasingly annoying, but I admire their try at an interesting combat system.  Pros: The game has an interesting combat system and very nice and interesting visuals.  Cons: The combat system is lacking some serious ui overlay to actually make the game bareable (like showing a vision cone/range of enemies) aswell as not clearly explaining how gimmicks work. The story and characters are too much of anime charicatures with cringeworthy dialogue (I expected this due to the artstyle but not to this degree). No restart button which is needed a lot if you want to score high on a mission. No mouse controls (but It's a decent port overall).  The only reason i keep trying to complete this game is to write a review, I liked the game overall when ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t things and cringeworthy dialogue didn't happen. If you liked this game then fair enough, but if you're coming off games like Red Orchestra 2 and Xcom like I did then you will be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off when playing it.  TLDR: If you're a turnbased and strategy player you wont enjoy it, neither if you are a ww1/2 enthusiast due to the bad dialogue. You will enjoy it íf you're a weeb or something who doesn't mind anime tropes."
"I want to start out by saying that Valkyria Chronicles is not a bad GAME, but it is a frustratingly bad STORY.  As a strategy Game, Valkyria Chronicles is an interesting expirience.  The Difficulty does seem to have only 2 setting thou, way to Easy and Dark Souls 2 Its also a bit frustrating that you can´t skip Enemy movement phase.   But as I said, the Story... Oh my God, that Story.  If you ever saw ANY Slice of Life Anime, this is the basically it.  Our main Character is the embodiment of the Mary Sue Trope.  His Sister is a stereotype Kuudere: Acts cool an unemotional but shows sweetness later  One Member of your Squad is a Tsundere: I´ll follow your orders. But...But.. It´s not that I like you or anything...  And the Heros Girlfriend is A MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING SUPER SAYAN THAT HE CALMS WITH THE POWER OF LOVE!!!! (Seriously, he gets an Ability called: Power of Love)  THAT was the point where I just could not take it anymore.   So, is it a bad Game? Absolutly not. But if your Game depends so much on Story, having one so bland and absolutly uninteresting, is just to heavy a blow to ignore.  Sadly, no recommend...."

As a gamer I really like doing the best job possible, I like to apply strategy and to apply min-maxing, and so to be punished for doing a good job, in my mind, is unforgivable. It's either bad design, or worse, it assumes that its players are incompetent or stupid.  The art style is awful. I wouldn't even call it a style, it's just a Photoshop filter over the rendered graphics. It's disgusting. I really mean it. If the story didn't insult you, this will. It doesn't go away, ever.  There was a period when I first started playing the game where it was exciting. I wanted to level up my classes, recruit new snipers, see what challenges lie in the next battle. But I soon learned that this is a really bad strategy game. I barely used my brain, and when I did, it didn't seem to matter. Eventually it all turned into 'whatever.' Line up a bunch of shock troopers because they can fire on advancing enemies? Never mind, the AI goes from point A to point B asap and immediately fires, which means you rarely fire back, so 'whatever.' Use 3-4 snipers on an open-field map? Oh wait, there are invisible walls blocking half the shots, so 'whatever.'  If I had to choose between either bringing this game with me to a deserted island or a stash of diapers, I would pick the diapers, make little lancers out of my own poo, and play with those instead."

"The game is great, but the lack of mouse control on menus kills it for me; especially when half the game is menus. Get it on PS3, or get the PS4 remake. The PC game isn't worth it."

"I started out sort of on board with this game. Its peusdo-WW2 happening in fake Europe was mildly interesting\ despite me becoming annoyed with some of the various sub plots. Yet despite this I continued trucking on until one particular mission just made me throw up my hands in frustration. I was feeling rather lukewarm on the game by this point and despite a plot twist that I wanted to see what became of, the mission design was frustratingly boring.  Specifically you perform some action and then a billion enemy troops show up. It will take the enemy 4 minutes and 40 seconds (no joke, I timed this) to complete their turn. Not only that, but this mission happens to have infinitely respawning troops. So that is 4 minutes and 40 seconds of boredom every single turn even if you kept killing them. I joked about playing an entire Hearthstone match while playing this mission. I've come close to beating this mission a few times before just throwing up my hands and declaring I'd rather just youtube the end of this. And this wasn't even the final mission!  A shame as until this point I didn't view it as a bad game (and in a way I still don't think its quite bad) but its enough that I'd suggest that folks look elsewhere for their entertainment."
11/10 love the game.  1/100 Alicia dies every time :(  
Well seeing as it crashes after the first mission and I have no clue how to fix it I'm going to have to say no. Not until I can find a way to fix it.  I've be looking forward to this game for so SO long I'm really sad.
the game is ok when it's not closing randomly and losing all your progress....
"This is a game with overwhelming visual appeal. It has a strong art style, great voice-acting, and some of the least awkward dialogue I've ever heard in a JRPG. It's a game that's not afraid to talk about racism, pregnancy, death and war. Granted, it tints that sordid tale with an anime twist and a girl who can punch tank shells into orbit, but still... it's there.  Despite that praise, however, I just can't recommended it... because that good story is pretty much ALL that Valkyria offers. This game has the highest cutscene/gameplay ratio of any game I've ever played, and as much as I enjoy the story, and as fun as the gameplay can be... I just can't shake the feeling that I'm basically reading a picture book with narration.   PROS:  + Strong storytelling, strong voice-acting, and unexpectedly sober dialogue about labor/birth, death, and racial profiling.  + A simple, but fun combat system heavily reminiscent of a less challenging XCOM:EU. Easy to learn.  + A friendly, 1940-ish asthetic that seems like something straight out of a Ghibli film.  + A strong soundtrack, nothing particularly memorable... but it's never annoying and always improves the atmosphere.  + An impressive amount of lore, biographies, and other world-building text.   CONS:  - OVERWHELMINGLY slow-paced. Cutscenes are unskippable, as is in-battle dialogue. Many cutscenes are optional... but you'll miss several important plot points if you don't watch ALL of them. Expect to spend 20-30 minutes in cutscenes and battle preparation in between combat.  - Upgrades are Level 1 Rifle -&gt; Level 2 Rifle. No branching paths, essentially no other items or choices for classes.  - Its overly-simple levelling and equipment systems make 'building a team' pointless and unrewarding.  - You are given no information on upcoming battles or events and thus, no opportunity to plan for them.  - The easy, repeatable 'Skirmish' maps undermine the game's difficulty by giving you as much free experience and gold as you want... whenever you want it.   SUMMARY  There is very little strategy in this SRPG. It's simple, easy, and combat often feels like an afterthought to what clearly got the developer's focus, the story. True, it's a remarkably well-written story... given JRPG standards, but too often it's told only through animated mugshots and dull walls of text. It's the video-game equivalent of being read to as a child... and if the combat were more engrossing, I'd be okay with that. To enjoy this game, you have to love its story AND its pace. If you don't, you're gonna be disappointingly bored."
"The artwork looks great, but its a shiny coating on a terrible game engine. Game mechanics are still set as if you were using a controller not a mouse and keyboard but they still function. Too much dialogue, everthing is broken between episodes, with about 4 to 5 of nothing but pure boring dialogue and then you have a single battle. The battles are designed to be random but the system is purely broken. In comparison to Xcom, if i have a guy point blank in xcom im guaranteed hits and guaranteed critical hits. Here I could be point blank and have half my shots go wide and the rest dont even do critical damage even though the game says shooting at the head lands critical hits. On top of this, if you are trying to do the missions while keeping your units at full health think again. Enemy units can take pot shots at you while you are moving, they are not serious but over time it can cost you, only thing your units do the same to them but the damage figures are pathetic. If you are a fan of anime/JRPGs you could get this but beware."
"TL;DR: Great visuals, mediocre story and characters, and the gameplay is fu#^ing go#&amp;@mn awful.   Go watch some decent anime instead. This is terrible as an anime and even worse as a game.  It's a beautiful-looking cheesy-story JRPG-inspired visual novel. ITS NOT a RPG, maybe close to a JRPG. Your actions have absolutely no influence on the story, just clear the levels to open new cutscenes, and click-click-click to see the dialog lines. While the visual design is impressive, the story and characters are pretty weak and break the immersion. It's impossible to 'feel the dredge of war' with their little cute anime character behavior and pre-teen storyline. (let me be clear I love good anime, but here the situations, the writing, the tone, and the voice-acting are all in disagreement)  The gameplay reminds me of the new XCOM:EU for combat options, but it sucks even worse. It feels more like a puzzle than a strategy/tactical game, and there's obviously a correct choice, which becomes clear once you know where the enemy units are placed. Which could make for an interesting game, but then... too much weight on RNG's, so not a good puzzle either. It's just an unmitigated disaster."
"Im playing this game currently and its really not the best turn based game out there, to be honest i dont under stand the over whelmingly positive reviews, for me the way the game is set up is abit frustrating, maybe its because X-Com is such a complete turn based game that i do not like this game, the story line is great as i like anime in general, but as i said the game play is bad, for example, when trying to inflict damage on the enemy there is no clear flanking position that makes the persentage of you shooting at them better, yes that is a x-com feature but i cant set up a strategy with a 50% chance of hitting the whole time. I find the design of this good but not great needs some polishing.All in all dont but this game as it for me is not a finished product and needs more turn base features to up your persentage in actually hitting someone"
"I like it so far, but here's the negative  The lighthearted mood and the drama it tries to convey doesn't mix. And so far I had 4 cutscences between each level (10 minutes each to complete).  It's a port from consoles and the keyboard controls are awkward; this is an issue because the gameplay is semi-turn-based  Buy it if it's on sale, and look elsewhere if you don't have a controller adapter"
"Okay....this one was hard....I read alot of reviews before even purchasing this game....Im not really impressed it is a wonderful game....but not addicting, I have to 'force' myself to play...I tell myself its a 'good game'. Its just not for me, doesnt keep my interest.   Rating: 7/10"
"Just play it.  The most innovative and thrilling TB system ever.... and yes, TANKS!!!"
ALL I CAN SAY IS THE GAME IS F*CKIN WICKED COOL! A MUST BUY GAME! IF I WERE YOU!
love the art but the game gets boring after about 25 minutes
"I wanted to like this game but I couldn't. I could predict exactly how the plot was going to go about 10 minutes into it and it seems to follow anime tropes. The PC controls, both keyboard+mouse and controller, are wonky in their own weird way and it didn't seem to be very strategic. I might pick it up and give it another try later, but for right now I'm just not into it. It wasn't particularly BAD, it just had enough quirks that I couldn't get immersed in it."
"Pacing is painful, poor controls and no ability to speed up the painfully slow text in the dozens of seperated video 'episodes' between combat."
"Typical Sega garbage; extreme amounts of cutscenes (skippable but never explained in game), no autosave (common with Sega), irritating combat system because moves take an unholy number of button presses as well as a fail equals a total scenario restart, awful graphics (even with lowered expectations) and, bad control scheme.  You want the story? Youtube.  Yes, Reviews are mostly positive. Most of my problems are with Sega not modernizing their games' user interfaces and control schema. I understand fanboi's don't think how clunky controls irritate people.  Conclusion: Worth no more than $5. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
"Eah. Played through the first couple of minutes. It was not so impressive. If you like listening to a lot of story, and enjoy the kind of Japanese RPG where some fierce young woman pledges to do something or other... this might be for you."
"I really enjoy turned based strategy games so given the high rating and very positive reviews for this game I thought it was a sure bet.  After reading the documentation which details the very badly designed interface I started the game. Twenty minutes later I knew the game wasn't for me. The story is juvenile in the extreme and the voice acting is cringe worthy. That would be okay if you didn't have to sit through it but unless I missed something you can't skip the story. No loss, what little I saw of the battles wasn't impressive, very simple and very drawn out. "
"I really want to give this game a thumbs up, but there is just one thing that pisses me off too much.   That one thing is total BS battles. For the most part, battles are somewhat normal and make sense. But every once in a while you run into a battle that is total BS. You just need to play them over and over until you either google the solution or figure out the method that the devs decided that you need to play in order to win. This isn't a test of your skill or creativity, but of figuring out what solution the developers intended. I kind of like the story and I would like to see how it turns out, but I can't deal with the stupid battles that you can't realisticly win without many attempts using trial and error to figure it out. It is terrible game design and I just have no patience for it."
"Beautile asthetics and garbage gameplay. Seems like all the work was put into the graphics (and the mind-numbingly bad 'story'), and little to the gaming experience. The combat system is shockingly bad, and about 15 years behind the standards of current TBS games. Turn-based battles take FOREVER!!!! I mean, like 20 minutes to play 4 rounds of battle. Like many of these games, there is a overblown abundance of 'story' in the form of endless cinematic scenes, and of course unessary and meaningless emotive dialogue that adds zero to the expereince.   Pros: It's pretty to look at.  Cons: Everything else."
it to hard u can beat any level on the 1st try u cant c any thing coming and make u try to beat levels faster than most gamers can 
"Let me tell you why you should NOT buy this game.  This is a good game. Hell it's great in some ways.  But it is NOT the game it is portayed as: To get the best score, which you of course have to to get the best rewards, items, acheivements and quests, you have to abuse the game.  I wouldn't mind strategic brilliance. But there's nothing of the sort. What you do is: Spam shield/protect on a scout, run said scout THROUGH THE ENTIRE MAP and finish the quest within 1-2 turns.   It's like someone made a strategy game, and then someone else added a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ asian-style 'GET CODE SS' system on it that ruins it all.   The first missions are great, you feel like it is war, like you're part of the story... Then it turns into the same ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t 'I WILL NEVER FORGET YOU' and 'B-baka, not like I needed your big tank or anything!' and more cringy 'Oh... Oh s-senpai tank-san, your barrel is so big'.  It's basically a mediocre JRPG (aka not a RPG, just a lineir levelingsimulator) that tries to give imitations of a wargame. And it does so amazingly the first 1-5 levels. Then it turns into a ♥♥♥♥ing achievement-whoring abusefest where you literally have to 'abuse' (optimize) things to get perfect rating and bonuses.   If you're the kind of person who doesn't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about achievements, getting best/better scores, and just care about the avarage feel; Then this is for you.  If not, then just watch a sumup on youtube."
"The more I play this game, the more I HATE it.  The major problem: The gameplay is not fun.  The story is ok, I actually enjoy it. It's the only reason I'm still trying to finish the game. Actually no, I take that back. The story is bad as well. Now that I think about it, the story is bad because there are no transitions between chapters. Within each chapter is a story that kind of connects to itself. However, there is absolutely nothing in between chapters. I remember going from a forest plot to a ♥♥♥♥ing desert plot for NO REASON AT ALL AND NOTHING WAS EXPLAINED. You're just told, hey, enemies in the desert, kill them all. How the ♥♥♥♥ did I get here from the forest?  The gameplay is terrible. In general, here's why: Score ONLY depends on speed. I personally enjoy slowly making rational tactical decisions to conquer my AI enemies. No. You get D rank for that. You get a D rank! You get a D rank! Everybody gets a D rank!!! ♥♥♥♥ OPRAH AND ♥♥♥♥ ALL THESE ♥♥♥♥ING D RANKS!! Basically, you get rewarded for blitzkrieging your way through every ♥♥♥♥ing level. I got an couple A ranks. Because I was tired of getting D ranks. I sent my scouts maximum move distance, again and again. Won in 2 turns. A rank. I did not have fun. Do that a couple of times and you realize, this game is utter ♥♥♥♥. Yes, I could have played in my own style and enjoyed the game. However, do you like getting a D rank in your ♥♥♥♥ing face after arduously pouring all your brain power into completely dominating the level? I didn't.  Levels HAVE TO be played twice. First play through: You have to see what the ♥♥♥♥ the level is about. And what the ♥♥♥♥ the enemy is going to do. Second play through: Pick your squad according to knowledge you obtained in the first play through. Play your squad according to what you know the enemy is going to do according to your first play through. Why the ♥♥♥♥ do I have to play the same ♥♥♥♥ing level twice to win it? How is that a war strategy game?  Examples: 1. First play through: I picked a team, did some stuff. Enemy turn: enemy kills HALF OF MY ♥♥♥♥ING TROOPS IN THAT SINGLE TURN. Hit reset, Second play through: I know the enemy is going to ♥♥♥♥ing slaughter me, so hide all of my troops ON MY FIRST ♥♥♥♥ING TURN. Win level. Hate game.  2. First play through: Got through half of the level, did major damage to giant tank, feel like I almost won. Some ♥♥♥♥♥ comes in, KILLS EVERYONE BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MAP. Second play through, do same ♥♥♥♥, keep troops at fringes of the map. ♥♥♥♥♥ kills no one. I even know which order to bomb the tank because I know which side the ♥♥♥♥♥ is gonna stand.  3. Infinite respawns until I kill two tanks. Slowly got wiped by infinite respawns. Goal of the map? Kill two tanks. Second play through: Move my ♥♥♥♥ing tanks behind the ♥♥♥♥ING SPAWN POINTS of those tanks. Trigger the spawn. Win game. Hate game.  I ♥♥♥♥ing hate this game. I loathe it. Look at those examples. Is that having ♥♥♥♥ing fun? Having absolute ZERO chance on your first play through? Being scored D rank for taking your time in a ♥♥♥♥ing strategy game?  Some other gripes: You can tell when the game is going to end. The chapters don't tell you, but the ♥♥♥♥ing question marks on your upgrades do. Oh, you've unlocked half of your question marks. Means your halfway through the game. Oh, you have a single upgrade left. Means you're almost done with the game.  Gripes: Long ♥♥♥ enemy turns. I can go make ♥♥♥♥ing dinner in the time it takes the enemy to take its turn. No fast forward.  Gripes: Scale. This is a war game. My squad has 10 ♥♥♥♥ing people maximum on the field. Fighting a war with 10 people. This isn't ♥♥♥♥ing counter strike. I took over a ♥♥♥♥ing castle with 10 people? I don't control dolls and this isn't Naruto.  Gripes: Unrealistic. No, I don't expect complete realism. However, my squad is wearing cloth, getting shot by machine guns and exploded by tanks rounds and walk it off. But a single cut scene bullet will kill a character. That is called disconnect.  Gripes: Know how I said there's 10 people on my squad? Yeah, I can only use like 3 of them. Each turn, you can only move like 3-4 of them. But you know what? You can't move the rest of your squard because 1. The other seven are not as useful as the three 2. They have low movement and can't keep up 3. You are being rated by turns 4. You don't have infinite turns. A level typically involes me running my scouts around killing everything. Or using my sniper to kill everything. Or using my tank to kill everything. Because that's how you can beat the level. The map is ♥♥♥♥ing large and the win condition is often: capture the flag at the other end of the map. So you take your longest range characters, all three of them, and move them across the ♥♥♥♥ing map.  Gripes: Kills don't do anything. You know how this is an RPG? Yeah, well, ♥♥♥♥ you, kills don't give you experience. Know what does give you experience? Guess. I dare you. It's how ♥♥♥♥ing fast you complete the level. Yeah. Your rating determines how much experience you get. Then you get to spend it in the training area, where literally, all soldiers of the same type are created equal. All soldiers of the same type have the same level. Always. Forever.  Basically: I hate this game. It is a bad game. I've read, 'Hey, you play this game for the plot. It has great plot.' First off, no, ♥♥♥♥ you, the plot sucks donkey balls. Second, this is a GAME and the GAMEPLAY should be FUN. I do want great plot, that's why I bought this GAME, but I also expect good GAMEPLAY. If I just wanted plot, I'd read a book or watch a movie. I'm playing this game because it's a game.  Plot: 4/10 Gameplay 1/10  You know what the worst part is? Remove the ranking ♥♥♥♥ altogether and MAYBE this game could have been fun. The gameplay should have been just complete or fail. No ranking. Then you could take your time. Maybe collect statistics like turns taken/enemies killed and display them fancifully at the end of each battle."
"Glitchy as hell, counterintuitive rules, and battles you have to save scum to score well in. This game is bad. Don't buy it."
"Hmm... To be honest, that's not what I was expecting... I thought I would play an old-school (yet splendid) tactical-RPG(ish), not a 'slightly-tactical but not so much' RPG. I know, my bad : should have checked the demo or watched twitch feeds.  Let's be clear : I'm not saying the game is bad, per se. I definitely didn't play enough. I'm just warning any potential buyer : make sure you know what you're spending your money on."
The story of this game is trash  - Feels like a propaganda film for the good guys rather than the war drama that it tries to be - It shoves ecological messages down your throat - Tries to be an epic story but completely screws that up by turning into a romance.  The setting of this game is bad and uninspired. They just took the map of europe and divided it into 2 lines; the good side and the bad side. I don't have any problems with the gameplay but 'Epic storyline' my ***. This game has way too much time devoted to a very sub par story to be worth it.  2/10 for the Story
Good potential ruined by RNG.
"The game might be quite good, but it's a console port and the interface really shows it. I found it cumbersome to play. With a more PC friendly interface, it'd be a thumbs up."
"Too hard, had to look online constantly in order to win any of the latter battles. Other than the difficulty, I realyl enjoyed it."
"The graphics style is different, but nice, keeping it from aging too badly, which will be a plus for some. But it felt like a half hour of ulocking 'episodes' that were just watching the story play out in comically bad dialogue before I could even play it. The best part, it wasn't even half an hour, it was about 15 minutes of soul-crushing boredom. And why did I have to keep deliberately choosing to start more pain, and when doing this, not knowing if there is actually going to be some gameplay when I confirm that I want to continue? I think this is really some kind of boredom experiment being carried out on an unknowing group of lab rats. After a few times of this, I didn't want to continue. Then, yes!, gameplay. And that was lackluster at best. Quit and uninstalled in less than half an hour. I couldn't find the will to continue, it could not possibly be worth it, unless maybe you're the experimenter..."
"Interesting art style.  Everything else gets more and more boring. Can't make the ennemy's turn faster. Not enough intel before a mission. Not logical to be immortal just because you are behind a wall in cover. Could have at least remake the cinematic in higher resolution, so blurry and jaggy.  Don't give a damn about the characters. Why is the squad full of people, but few on the battlefield?  I don't recommend it because it is for people that likes this sort of slow pace long thing.    "
"The game has a really good focus on storyline, and the combat is engaging and different from most games. It's set during a second world war which started due to mineral resources running out. You can use many different units tactically, and even play skirmishes. The units you have are hand picked, and perform differently depending on where the battle is, and who is with them. You upgrade weapons and armour, aswell as train your units to make them perform better.   One downside is, tank movement is REALLY REALLY clunky. Sometimes I'll get stuck on nothing, and all my movement points will get used in a split second.   I'd strongly recommend it.   And best of all, cute anime girls will bake you bread!"

"graphics: 10/10 story: 8.5/10 gameplay: 3/10 overall: 6/10  i really, really loved this game, until i finished the second match. you see, at the end of the match, you are given a ranking that acts as a multiplier to your experience and income earned. that ranking is A for the minimum number of turns the map can be completed in, and goes down one letter for each extra turn you take. this game was very enjoyable as a casual 'have fun and play, listen to/watch the great story and graphics' thing, but when you add the constraint that rushing is always the best strategy, it is completely at odds with the rest of the game design and all but ruins the experience for me. (and yes, the exp/credits also increase based on the number of enemies killed, but it honestly doesn't balance out)  also, a minor irritation, the target circles for the lancer and tank shots appear to be about half the radius of the actual area it could hit. what's the point of having a giant red target circle if your shot isn't going to land in it? (yes, these could be 'misses' but they happen far, far too often.)  so i mean if you're fine with getting a C or a D just because you're having fun &amp; moving carefully, then you can probably enjoy the game. if you're a perfectionist, though, anticipate reloading the game constantly just because that shot missed and that means a B rating. don't let the game's star rating fool you into thinking it's great from a gameplay perspective, because on top of combat being slow and irritating, you're going to have to overextend yourself beyond dangerously (to the point that you'll probably need to know their positions and moves ahead of time) &amp; leave half the enemies alive to even break a C at times.  one more gripe, the terrain objects have a much larger hit box than their actual size, and there's no indication as to whether you're going to hit their invisible boxes before you hit fire.  this could've been a great game, but its flaws make it really, really mediocre. maybe just watch the youtube videos of the story and bask in the glorious, lovely cel shading, because this game stands as a testament that no one in the industry gives a flying bunny about game design anymore (probably because most of you don't even know what a proper game should feel like)."
"I want to like this game, as the play is incredibly detailed and fun however the really, really bad tactics in the game make it almost unbearable. You work your butt off, keep everyone alive and leave everyone of your enemies dead is just a couple of turns to get a C ranking. After playing the same maps testing out strategy after strategy you find out the only way to get a top score is to behave like an idiot and game the system. I guess if you are the kind of person who enjoys min-maxing equipment for hours and replaying missions over and over to (or just want to use a strategy guide) this game might be worth it for you, but I really wasn't thrilled. Picked it up for the PC hoping things would be different, but alas, it was the same issues."
"This game looked like it would be a lot of fun, but serious issues which rendered it unplayable for me.  - Buggy PC port. You can lose a long battle because one of your units glitches through the floor, making it impossible to use. - The AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and cheats to compensate. On a map where the enemy had two tanks, it used both of those tanks to attempt to fire anti tank rounds at one of my machine gunners. It lined up its tanks in the process, such that the back tank ended up killing the front tank. It killed its own ♥♥♥♥ing tank trying to shoot a machine gunner with anti-tank rounds. - RNGesus take the wheel. Using the sniper, tank, and rocket launcher units early on can be frustrating due to their awful accuracy."

"Good god, for every small mission you get to play, Valkyria Chronicles forces you to sit through six to eight cutscenes, throughout which some strong philosophical concepts are explored but executed with all the grace of a mass-gassing. Dialog is cringe-worthy, interactions are barely above a child's Saturday special, and in that spirit everything is explained, repeated, and beaten over the player's head just to make sure we got the ♥♥♥♥ing message. And as to be expected of anything Japanese, it's unbearably saccharine featuring androgynous tweens full of angsty drama taking on diesel-punk tanks with lances. Today's McGuffin is a sort of precious metal that serves as everything from a healing agent to light source, fuel to ammunition. Can't imagine why there's a shortage of it. Which is the cop-out geo-political excuse for the evil empire, full of heartless sadistic mooks who gun down civilians and beat pregnant women, to invade Western 'Europa' (♥♥♥♥ing seriously?). This criminally bloodless rebranding of WWII (it's even a 'Second Europan War' in the story) does touch on some strong points; aristocracy, the unnaturalness of human conflict, philosophy of equilibrium, but it's all buried under soap opera drama and atrocious writing. Commendation is deserved for the effort put into individualizing every otherwise generic mook in your squad, but unfortunately they stuck to the typical anime formula of angst, drama, and subliminal pedophilia.  Gameplay has some innovative concepts; turn-based strategy with third-person control of your characters as you move them. But the environments seem lazily built, since you can only crouch at sandbags and even then you can't take cover in a corner to enjoy two-sided protection. You can hide in grass, even when the enemy knows you're there, which brings up the ironic situation of concealment trumping cover. Moves are pooled for your units, adding some strategy, and health and grenades regenerate between turns. There's no reloading, probably because of the most frustrating gameplay feature; constant fire. The enemy will shoot at whichever unit you're moving during your movement phase, and usually stop when you take aim. Sure, your units will do the same to them, but computers end their turn as soon as they've moved, so if you're navigating the finicky terrain in their sightlines, expect to lose a lot of health (even in cover). If you have a unit trying to duel with an enemy face-to-face (especially when they're toting an automatic), better start writing a letter to their next of kin. The tank is no better, turning unpredictably and running into obscure geometries. But worst of all to gameplay is the fact that this game is a prime example of the bad kind of port. You only ever can use the mouse to look around when controlling the units, and the arrow or WADS keys in combination with the space bar at all other times. This is most apparent in the menus, where to switch to the next tab in the main menu, you must open the mini menu and choose the tab you want to go to. As one renowned reviewer perfectly described it; it's a broken fractal spreadsheet nightmare. On the plus side, your squadmates in reserve level up along with those sent into the field, but the upgrading is linear and thus feels like busywork."
Silly story with clunky gameplay.
"The gamplay is slower than a snail through molasses! You watch 2-4 painfully slow-paced cutscenes before you jump into a painfully-slow mission where you repeat the same painfully-slow action every turn. And don't forget to manually save before each mission because this game lacks auto-save and no one in their right mind would ever want to do anything in this game more than once, if at all."
"Great game for the most part, nice story, interesting characters but an extremly frustrating combat system. For example while taking cover behind your tank you 're getting retaliation fire from the enemy while being unable to shot back since your tank is in the way. Or even better the first boss battle is difficult but okay until you almost have him and a supernatural footsoldier enters the battlefield that is invincible to even a tank main cannon and will take out several of your troops. So if you actually liked your characters you have no choice but to loose some here. Liked the game until that point but cannot recommend it after that."
"I wish Steam had a neutral or “meh” option between recommend and not but given only those two… I have to not recommend this game. It isn’t awful, but it certainly doesn’t seem to deserve all the praise it gets. The story is pretty bland, basically an alt-history version of WWII, with a bunch of silly characters. The visuals are very nice and the gameplay is unique. However the big issue is the game is a tactical based game but tactics aren’t a thing you want to use if you want to do well. Speed is the be-all, end-all of getting a good mission score in the game, and mission score is what gets you XP and money. So you end up doing moronic things like charging straight at the enemies to shoot them in the face, letting your troops go down (because so long as you finish the battle fast they are fine) and not executing any sort of defensive plan at all.  Maybe this is impressive on consoles but on the PC, where we’ve plenty of REAL strategy games with good tactical combat, it falls a bit flat. Combine that with lackluster RPG elements and I really can’t give this game a recommendation. If it is on sale and you are bored looking for anything mildly RPG and/or tactical to play then get it, but otherwise give it a miss. There’s a whole bunch of better games of both types on Steam."
Played through 10 chapters (about 8 hours) then i decided to take a break and so i closed down the game. Next day i come back and all there was on the menu was 'new game'. That is when i realised this game had no autosave features between chapters.   Rage / 10
"Be sure to bind your controls correctly the first time, It's the only chance you get.  Ended up with missing control bindings, couldn't play the game, couldn't rebind them. 10/10 Paraplegic simulator."
It's good.
"Are you a weeaboo? If yes, buy. If no, run for the hills-the interesting but awkward combat system isn't good enough to be worth suffering the JRPG tripe."
I really envy the people who can play Sega games. Both this and Sonic Generations don't work on my computer. This seems like a really good game and it seems a lot of people agree with me considering as I am writing this it recieved a 95% positive rating. The graphics are new but classicly great-it looks like you're reading a book in 3d. The voices are flawless. The combat is turn based but fast paced.  Unfortunately this game crashes too much to be playable so I cannot recommened this.
"I really tried to like this game: it has a wonderful visual style, interesting mechanics and a relatively engaging story.  ...But finally I got angry. There are TOO MANY dialogues! They come in several shapes, some - as a proper cinematic, others - as talking heads before missions, between missions and during missions. And in most cases you have to constantly click to listen to the next reply. In the end, you spend more time waiting for all these talks to take place than actually playing. It’s not a joke.  Out of those 25 hours I’ve played, not less than 10 were spent on these unending briefings, personal chats and then some “tips” and then some additional “last tips”.  Speaking about these dialogues... They are too deeply rooted in the most blatant anime tropes on Earth. A “funny” cute “clever” piggy with wings. The main hero too nerdy and busy to notice advances of the main heroine. Some antagonists deadly overdosed with pathos and arrogance. And then you have all these soldiers -_- they all have stories, dead relatives, burned homes, but they all behave like they are some school girls on a volleyball championship, not soldiers caught in the middle of a world war. This is all too much. Too anime-ish, too clicheed, too unrealistic.  Note: I am not an anime-fan, but I watched and enjoyed Trigun, Cowboy Bebop, Hellsing, Elfen Lied and Fullmetal Alchemist."
Many people say Valkyria Chronicles is an underrated Game. But the game couldn't electrify me. Maybe the game mechanics are nice but the childish story prevented most fun for me.
"Not recommended if you play with KB&amp;M  This game is probably really fun to play, light on strategy and medium on RP, but if you really want to dig into it, you better have a controller. This game is all about completing objectives in the fewest number of turns, and using a KB&amp;M simply will not allow you to do that. Tank controls are very frustrating, and you waste a lot of AP just trying to get anywhere.  On a console, I'd probably play this through multiple times, but on PC it's just an excercise in frustration."
"This Chinese-knock-off of world war 2 is pretty good. Gameplay is great, and the port runs well, if menu controls are bit dumb. The story is about as good as slippery wet butts."
Just wait until you get to desert level where the enemy anime goddess runs behind you lines and one shots your entire army. This is not a strategy game; it is an JRPG with a team building element that just could not make up for the lack of actual strategy in the gameplay.
This game may have been really good when it originally came out but now the interface is somewhat painful. The graphics are computer based anime style. If you like the style you may like the game. To me it is like playing a soap opera. I just want to gouge out my eyes...
"oh yeah they have a tank in tha garage at home . ...the story is not very plausible, there are other things which i dont wanna spoil  -very scripted ai and fights -stupid ai  let me explayn how the typical fight works: 1: you get few hints prior to fight (which are pretty useless) to prepare ur unit tactical 2: u loose the fight and think wow is that game difficult 3: u start the fight again with more knowledge about ur enemy and the battlefield and the fight gets actually very easy 4: feel like a master of tactics because you beat the game   so u will get kinda forced to make almost every fight twice and since it can take up to an hour and you cant save the game in between enjoy your waste of time  one positive thing: there is no game like this so + for the creative design"
It's alright.
"This game can be best described as the aborted fetus of the crossing between Final Fantasy Tactics and XCOM, with about a fourth of the depth of either game.  The story writing is cringy cheese and hardly enjoyable to anyone but the most hardcore of weeaboo neckbeard autists."
Excellent mechanics cannot save this game from a vomit enducing story.
great nostalgic feel if that is your thing. but too slow paced for me
"The tactical gameplay is OK;  story is typical world war theme, nothing to complain about.  but those cutscenes...it's simply japanese jerkoff anime combined with soap opera.  I started skipping all of them after I hit chapter 1 because they make my skin crawl and what they say in there is completely predictable. 'Oh I must defend my home' 'Oh I have to save everyone in this town!' 'Oh I want to remember war is not just people killing people.' 'Oh you just met this girl? When will she become your girlfriend?'  Basically 80% of your gaming time here will be watching meh-boring cutscenes.  And most importantly, the porting is very very weird. I use a keyboard and I can't use 'Enter' key for confirming stuff, it's very very unintuitive and you can't change the key bindings."
Decent game play. Lots of cutscenes which half of the time is unwatchable (poor script). Progression that is 100% useless and only there to force you to slide a bar and click on boxes. Stearing that is bugged and loosing rounds because you get stuck on air and didnt bother to click boxes 10/10 ...
"Urgh...  Ever wanted to have an anime version of WW2? Welp, then I guess this game fits that category, because the similarities between that war and the one in this game are so obvious that it can become hard to take seriously. There are even links to the holocaust as there is a race universally hated and blamed for all things wrong with the world who find themselves at the recieving end of... some pretty unpleasant stuff. As for which 'country' you are imitating, I don't really have a direct answer for that, since there manages to be some variation in this respect. And while your enemy is unmistakably Nazi Germany, yours seems like a mix of peaceful neutrals and allied countries who suffered greatly but ultimately won.   Anyway, You play as a tree-hugging tank commander who has to wage war against the 'Empire' with a small squad without expecting any real outside support since everyone else is pretty unreliable and often treacherous. The characters close to you are an alright bunch with varied quirks and issues that sometimes cause tension. The anime art style is rather well-done and as far as being a console port is concerned this is one of the better ones i've seen. The voicework is kinda... well if you are familiar with anime dubs you probably know, and hopefully such does not bother you too much. Cutsey characters and voices to match them are at odds with the dark tone of much of what happens, but again this is hardly new or necessarily bad. It just makes some moments a little wierd.  The gameplay consists of watching alot of cutscenes, messing around in menus to upgrade things, and fighting in tactical turn-based battles. As someone who has played quite a bit of X-COM and has beaten it on Impossible difficulty, I know a thing or two about this sort of gameplay and the fine difference between brutal difficulty and bull****. Unfortunately, while this game starts off quite well, it frequently begins to dip itself in the poo category in the later story missions with hordes of enemies and sudden emergencies that became more irritating than challenging. I had to exploit one mission entirely where the game put you at the center of a large encirclement on terrain that was too poorly suited for defense.   At least the BS extended to your ability to summon medical assistance from another dimension that allowed fallen comrades to be carried away and then ready to re-join the fight literally a turn after being shot in the head by a sniper or some other similar incident that would normally be fatal. The result was that I managed to finish the game without a single member of my squad dying aside from the ones that are supposed to as part of the story.  Also this game grades your performance. Usually very poorly unless you exploit foreknowledge of the battle and finish it within ~3 turns (of 20). Lovely...  Speaking of the story, I wish I could be nicer to it than I am going to be, but I really can't. It's one of the most wearily predictable stories i've ever played, and I found myself in a state of bored annoyance even during (most) moments of high drama and sadness. Only one event in the story managed to catch me off-guard, and the shock was quickly replaced by a wish that the cliche death scene would just finish already so I could stop watching it. I guess I'm just tired of 'war is hell', 'vengeance is wrong', and 'awkward romance' scenes because they are way too overused. I've heard some argue that 'Japan has different storytelling methods' and therefore I should be less annoyed by what I find in this game, but as a long-time anime watcher I  know  that is wrong. Stories that can make you believe you are heading into cliche-town and then give you a nasty and unexpected surprise are hardly unique to the west. Ask anyone who has seen the VN's or anime adaptations of the works of Key/VisualArts.  To be honest, I'm surprised I kept playing despite all my annoyances. And there is where I find myself a little confused about my overall feelings of this game. Did I keep playing because I just wanted it all to end and be done with, or was I really enjoying it despite all my irritations? I don't have a satisfactory answer for that, and I might even play it further simply because I am a crazy person when it comes to achievements. But I do know that, as a whole, I don't recommend this game. It does plenty of things well and might even be a 'good JRPG', but there are enough things that bother me that I can't, in good conscience, tell others that this is something they should buy and play.  So go ahead and downvote this review like every negative review i've done of popular games. It won't change the fact that this game could have been alot better than it was, and that it did not meet the promise of the expectations I was given of it."
"While the first-person battlefield navigation has the potential to create a more immersive experience, collision problems and other related mechanics create nightmares for carrying out planned maneuvers. Commonly, the following will occur:  - You will waste action points attempting to walk into terrain that appears passable but is not. - You will fire, appearing to have clear line of sight, only to have your shot explode right in front of you. - Your tank will spin-out and burn through all of its action points. - You will toss a grenade and have it bounce off/get caught on invisible barier.  There are many more problems that disrupt what would be a mediocre top-down strategy game by introducing first-person navigation. The experience really isn't worth it."
"This game is overhyped and overestimated. It is quite poor actually and typical of console games... main reason I have banned consoles from my life for the past 15 years.  This is a typical console game from the 1990s. It's really bad because of its re-tarded nature, There are no auto-save! I mean come on, how hard can it be to add an autosave! For god's sake we're in 2015! These guys are caught in the early 1990s.  This game is HUGE on your HD, and yet, I don't see where all that data is. The game is just a dumb tactical combat game with very small maps. Where IS that 22 gig of data in this game?  Don't waste your money on this game unless you are a fan of the series and it acually costs you less than 5$. Because once you finish this game, you won't be playing it a second time, it's too long (in the sens that everything takes forever to happen) and tedious to play.  What I mean is that since it's a typical crappy console game, the designers adds delay codes everywhere plus loading screens every time you change page. COME ON! This game is so empty and devoid of any content there shouldn't be ANY loading screens at all. It is a really bad game design, typical of consoles."
"I would strongly recommend watching some gameplay of this on youtube before buying it. It's turn based combat which isn't what it looks like from the store page. There's an awful lot of pointless cutscenes but you can skip all of them.  Also, the audio starts off being way too quiet for the voices (can't adjust) then completey goes."
"I was enjoying this game &amp; even got near the end of it with almost no failures but then a weak scout took out my much stronger engineer from full health in a split second at long range with an incredibly inaccurate gun &amp; my engineer immediately died right after that for no reason. Clearly that was the point when the creators were done giving a ♥♥♥♥. Especially considering my fully upgraded weapons were missing at close range on that mission.  One could argue that one bad mission isn't a good reason to quit a game. I would argue that no game has ever gotten so bad so suddenly without staying bad from that point on. I've also watched my brother play some of the last missions &amp; they looked like total bullhit too. One of 'em spawned an entire additional much bigger army directly around him in a cutscene so he had to just deal with it after the scene was over.  Also, the dialogue &amp; cinematics are amazingly terrible &amp; I'm supposed to care about two racists. Also, people are constantly talking on the radio just to spew nonsense &amp; bad advice."
"Seems like turn-based strategy but actually a puzzle game. To get A or B, you have a few ways to maneuver your units. The maps are too small and units' mobility is strongly restricted  And so, it is almost impossible to perform a lot of creative ideas-which is necessary in TTS or RTS. And that is the cause of my major disappointment. Everything else is nicely done, but you should think twice before buying this since it wouldn't be a game you imagined."
What an absolutely garbage game.
"I'm not saying the game is bad.It's worse ıf you like to play action/fps/rpg/fighting games.What I'm trying say... this game does not have those genres.So it's a typcal tatical team rpg.Every game around at least 30 or max 140-~ minutes.My limit is 140 min.That was very boring... I'm holding to head with sniper unit and it's missing often...(even though I'm putting through their head).If you try All of your squad come to center,It'll take 3-4 round at least.that'll be around 6-8 round. story is not bad I guess.Yet the game is no good for someone liking to anime or manga"
Boring
"Story is good, gameplay isn't."
Even a weeaboo like myself can't withstand the moe ♥♥♥♥ in this game desu.
"About an hour in i got the first crash, which is nice"
"The game is mostly wasted animation time.  The moves can be chosen in a few seconds. The time to watch the animations for the moves play out can take several minutes. The enemies' moves, likewise, involve a lot of time watching attack animations. This is a tremendous flaw. I've played the actual game for around an hour, but I have 7 hours of animations logged in the playtime too.  The tactics involved in the battles are very simple and make the game easy. The combat system, allowing a single unit to attack many times on a turn, discourages squad positioning in favor of running a single unit through multiple enemies.  The character progression is pathetic and the music run-of-the-mill.  The only two things going for this game are the animation style and the mixture of first-person character control with strategy.  Conclusion: $10 wasted."
"Good port, great visuals and story, but not a particularly satisfying strategy game. Difficult to keep units together once maps open up. 'Boss' maps introduce game mechanics out of nowhere that practically guarantee failure on the first attempt. Early levels showed a lot of promise but eventually it turned into a chore and a slog that I just dreaded playing."
"This game should have way more missions, more customization, instead its way more linear than it should be. The narrative' s also insignificant. The combat is fun, but the rest is just not good enough for me to recommend it."
"The story is great but the gameplay is meh.   I don't know exactly how turned out the Overwhelming Positive but I hated the gameplay.   1. Skirmishes are just replayed maps from scenario of the story. 2. Possibly because there's so much like spaces that turns out to be part of a wall (like hitting something on the open beside a wall, and IT impossibly hits the wall) or a because there's too many bugs.   There are so much to be fixed in this crap.  Lines are not skippable. I had to spam press B or cancel everytime there's a line to be said.  Story is great, but if I had to buy the game, it's really not worth the cash, better invest in the PSP version than this. and watch the anime instead."
"Console port with seriously awkward controls and other issues.  * Charakters do not sidestep. They turn and step forward - because keeping your line of sight in a battle is completely irrelevant. This makes positioning characters at the point where you want them facing the direction you want them really awkward. Ever tried hiding behind a tree? Left of it, right of it, left of it, right of it, out of action points right in the line of enemy fire. Restart battle. * Tanks where turret and track controls are interlinked. C'mon, GI Joe has had them properly separated last millenium on the C=64. This causes the tank not to go where you expect it to, wasted action points. Restart battle. * Tanks that can't climb hills/obstacles the height of a single stair. Rendering waypoint planning obsolete, wasting command points, restart battle. * General hitbox issues. Will my character move through that narrow gap or not? It's wide enough in terms of visible graphics, let's see what the collision box designers had in mind. Nope, action points wasted, envisioned route not viable, restart battle. * You noticed all that restarting the battle? That's especially annoying because you cannot. It's just not there. You have to work around that by saving immediately after the battle started. Unless you forgot because no game designer would not provide an abort option unless the game had permadeath. * You can't view/change the controls during gameplay: Console port with a strapped-on configuration tool. Well, at least there is a configuration tool. Notably well intended: mouse-axis inversion very cusomizable, both axis for different modes. And as usual, well intended is the opposite of well done: due to the strap-on configuration tool, you have to go several restart-the-game cycles until you have found the setting suitable for you. Funfunfun.  Update: You can change the axis inversion also from the top title screen, which is a tad better. The keys you can not. Also, in case you wonder why there are two sets of movement keys - moving = running, walking = walking. Total obvious choice of words - if you are the developer. Don't bother trying to configure the same key set with a modifier, ie. shift. Not possible. It's only one of the most common control setups for PC games, no need to support that. * Uninterruptible/pausible long operations, ie. 'Enemy phase'. Note to port developers: Unlike consoles, on PCs using the reset button to return to the main title is not customary and frowned upon. * Annoying tutorial trying to be helpful and repeating everything everytime you restart a battle. Once is enough. * Flanking enemies is pointless. If an enemy is crouched beside sandbags, it does not matter if the sandbags are between him and the bullet or if you shot him in the head at point blank range. Pardon, but what kind of logic is that? * Switching between the tabs (Book, Headquarters etc.) by using a submenu of the system menu? Are you serious?  In case you wonder my obsession about action points etc. - the game rewards minimizing the turns required to complete an objective. That's OK for a strategy game, but makes 'try and error' to find out the game's quirks a total annoyance.  This is what I noticed after just (was: 2 is now) 4 hours of game time, killing the fun and thus the game.   A pity though, since art style and story seem really appealing. Additionally, the gameplay with all the options seems rather interesting - its just the user interface that gets permanently in the way.  Note to self: Get smart already and don't buy any more console ports."
"The story is bland, the writing is bland, and the art is bland. The combat system is interesting and would be enough to save it....if it weren't for the _horriffic_ interception fire system.  Basically, as long as you have control of a character, if an enemy has line of sight on you, they will constantly fire at you, regardless of whether or not you are taking any actions. (Unless you're in aim mode for some reason). Of course they do so as soon as you take control of your character, unavoidably. They get a free counterattack if you fire at them. And if you don't spam the escape key to give up control of your character as soon as you're done shooting, they get a _third_ attack on you, compared to your one attack on them. You can choose to control characters that aren't close enough for interception fire to matter...because apparently it's so distracting that they can only shoot at guys that are moving rather than the guy sitting right in front of them. But sometimes you need to control characters that are being fired at, so you basically _have_ to learn how to exploit all these unintuitive loopholes in order to survive.   It goes without saying that the AI is not bound by the same silly rules that you are.  All in all, I feel like it's more important for me to know how to exploit the weird, unintuitive rules of the game rather than make sound tactical decisions. And judging by the forums I've read, there's a ton of them. (Interception fire is more frequent at 60fps, you can cancel some interception fire by entering aim mode and cancelling out of it, etc). It's horrific, it's unintuitive, and it's not fun. Throw on some nonsensical 'potentials' thing to differentiate characters (which can apparently make some characters literally useless depending on if you take certain completely unrelated actions), and it's a reciple for a pile of crap.   "
" On the plus side  The art/animation is acceptable, and on a very general level, the feel is near enough to FullMetal Alchemist that SEGA has succeeded in creating a world immersive enough to deserve MUCH better execution, and the character voices are not over-the-top annoying (like the blase coffee-shop dialogue is: 'I know I just arrested you for drawing fish, but now I have baked you some bread! Let's go for a walk. Oh, the invasion is back again...').  Which brings me to the criticism.  If you're looking for anything remotely realistic: fail. (I wasn't, but it's bad enough to give this warning)  If you're looking for that anime-tastic feeling of action: fail. (I  was , and the ads certainly did appear to offer that... but it's all storytelling, chapter by chapter, and you can't FF through anything separating fights where there's literally a construction line barrier blocking the most sensible flanking moves on the map, for no reason at all)  If you like being run through a forced-script and fighting with ridiculous limitations as to where your 'tactical' movement options dictate your only available moves; and if you want your leader to be a little girl who worked in a bakery before the war broke out, who is still a little girl; and if you want your hero to be so oblivious that he draws fish in a sketchbook while a war is on around him because, 'I sometimes forget that people might be watching me'; and if you want a kb/mouse interface that is so annoying that you literally have to WASD + Space + Enter + left click to make it through every turn while the enemy is shooting at you without a chance to shoot back... this game may be for you.  Seriously: WASD/arrow + left click even the start screen, then left click the mouse to select... because the mouse functionality is not enabled for anything other than a L-click. Poor execution from controller to kb/mouse there, I understand, but it's just the icing on the cake for me.  10 hours of my life I'll never get back is more than enough. While I'm glad I bought on sale, that's 2 gallons of gas I could have gone 60 miles on.  I have no idea how this game got such good reviews; I give it a solid 4.5 derps out of 5."
I should have bout it on console the pc version crashes alot
"This game is extremely dissapointing. What infuriated me was the fact that the tank moved in circles on it's own, which cost a lot of AP and made my tank useless and caused me to constantly lose. So that is a huge problem. Before this damn problem, I'd recommend this game to people who are into this genre. But in light of your most important unit behaving so glitchy, I'd advise AVOID THIS GAME."
"I may be one of the very few who doesn't recommend this game, though it's not without reason.  Valkyria Chronicles is a game I was very hyped about. I saw the PS3 trailer before release, and has been wanting to play it ever since, but without a PS3 I couldn't. People saying it's one of the best SRPG ever only helps raising that hype even further. Of course, when it was announced for Steam, I was overjoyed, and immediately bought the game. Turns out it was quite disappointing. To make a break down:  Story: It was meh. Not terrible, but it's just average. Basically you're fighting against an empire of evilness, you have a militia squad which always does its mission spectacularly and ended up being a cornerstone of the military while the other squads are almost invisible, and the army being so stupid it's a wonder they are military, which is meh to me. I also don't like how many characters act; for military personnels, their actions seem more intended on creating a dramatic effect, which backfires as it often makes them look stupid.  Music: It was okay I guess. Nothing memorable, but it does its job for the appropriate scene.  Graphics: Considering this is a port of an old PS3 game, don't expect AAA PC graphics. It's nice too look at though, I really dig the shading style.  Gameplay: Now this is where my main complaint comes from. VC was often praised for having awesome gameplay, and I agree for the the first half of the game. The mechanics are nice, combining standard SRPG but requiring you to move your characters manually similar to an action game during their turn. It leads to a lot of interesting possibility, like aiming an enemy through a crack in the wall etc. And some of the destructible environments help making it nice experience. So why am I complaining? It's the difficulty and the balance.   The main story is so easy that I get constant A ranks even without grinding even once (the game has skirmishes where you can grind for EXP and money). The optional story is more fun, but there's only a handful of them.   The balancing really sucks. The game has a ranking system, where the less turns you take to clear a stage, the higher your rank, and the more money and EXP you get. It makes it so that the one most-efficient strategy is a full offensive rush. And thanks to that, mid-game, one unit-type (out of five available unit-types), the Scout, becomes too OP that spamming that unit-type is often the easiest and fastest way to win, while 2 unit-types are situationally useful, and the last 2 are mostly useless. It really takes away from the fun I had early game where every unit shines in their own role, since Scouts now can cover things that should be left for the other units. Sure, they still have their shortcomings, but those are mostly things that don't really matter, or easily covered by its advantages. It's even worse with the Order mechanics, where you can buff any unit anywhere on the map, which is capable of covering the Scout's weaknesses BUT is not capable of giving the Scout's main advantage to other units. It's the reason why I take a long time finishing the game; it just became boring.  Overall, I wouldn't really recommend this game if you really care about strategy, balancing, or story. However, it might be worth it if you're curious how the gameplay mechanics work, because frankly, that single aspect of the game is awesome. I give it a 6/10."
"Good lord hell no. I think I am just about done with every Japanese RPG. I dont know what is going on over there, but virtually everything blows these days and I'm completely at a loss as to why people say otherwise. Nothing in this game makes any logical sense. It's infuriating. They tried to make some kind of rough draft of a turn-based warfare game here but it's batshit crazy. One of my 100 gripes is that the enemy will obliterate your guys in a fraction of a second even while time is frozen, while your guys only attack them while theyre in movement. Even if I spent time trying to learn how to exploit a completely busted battle system, I would take no pleasure in it. The system just feels like dozens of people were throwing half-baked combat ideas at a wall to see what would stick, but they never bothered to ask themselves if any were fun or balanced.  Beyond the terrible gameplay, all you're left with is the usual weeaboo Japanese garbage that was making me cringe 16 years ago when it first started infesting gaming. I cant force myself to give a crap about any of these characters. The dialog is all stale, and mind numbing. There's seemingly infinite pointless cutscenes that are nothing but facial windows gabbing at each other about ♥♥♥♥ that doesn't matter. It's all lost on me, I guess.  I also think the visual style of a coloring book is nothing but a lazy gimmick. It has no place in this game or it's content. There's only so many user-hacks out there to remove the annoying graphics. You can't fix it."
"After having read several really good reviews I thought I give the game a shot. Unfortunately I cannot agree to all the positive opinions. My main points of critique are:  1. The story line is only seen by some very poorly animated scenes which you can select in a book. The book is essentially the center point of all interaction. This feld very out of date to me and is also very clumsy to use.  2. The strategy as far as I played was poorly executed and a lot of terrain could not be used properly. E.g.: Why can i hide/crouch behind sand bags, but not behind wall parts? This seems riddling to me.  3. The story line is presented in a very infantile way, which might be nice for a younger audience but left me completely cold. Also all characters felt like taken out of the book of stereotypes. The orphans going to safe the world from the evil empire. There is literally no feeling of war coming to me when I play this. It is rather like a stroll in the park with some shooting involved.  4. Controls of the tanks are very poorly exectuted and feel very 'spongy'.  5. The AI is poor. Instead of actively trying to win it sometimes is just sitting there and begs to be beaten. Instead of having a good AI you get mission limitations (e.g. number of turns to end a mission) which make up the difficulty.   6. The graphics are awful. Literally no Antialiasing. A drawing style which makes even the oldest Anime look like a wonder of art.  So if you really seek for a strategically fulfilling experience with good story telling in a mature way: Keep your hands off this. If you want a nice children's anime maybe this is yours.  Best thing about it: I can uninstall!"
"I love JRPGs, and have played them since the NES days. I love the art and the writing and atmosphere, and I own a ton of them. And I do not understand why this game is so loved. It's rare that I get half-way through a game before I just stop caring, but that's what I did here. It's not terrible, no, but it's so unbelievably boring. The battle system is far too luck-based; snipers, for example, are incredibly frustrating, unlikely to accomplish anything of note without saving/reloading constantly to get the results you want. Furthermore, the way the mechanics work, it's just about always possible that the computer could kill some characters or even your hero (instant game over), but it rarely does, meaning there's a fluctuating line of just how much the AI will punish you. It could, for example, have it's tank roll up and shoot yours 5 times and you die. It probably won't, but it's very difficult to know exactly where that line is; 2 times, 3 times, 4 times? It's just luck. Likewise with any enemy; they could get lucky and kill a few of your guys in rapid succession, meaning you've lost, or they could barely hit anything at all and you shred them in your counter attack, virtually winning the fight. Additionally, you can only see units you have line of sight on, so you are guaranteed to get surprised by guys you didn't know were there, ripping your poor scout apart, or some mortar dropping fire on you from the other side of the map. You can't see their range of movement, range of fire, or anything like that on the map. Sure, you'll just memorize it and beat it next time, but this feels so cheap and ruins any sense of immersion in this stategy war game; there's nothing wrong with having a luck factor but it should not be the overwhelming influence of everything you do, enabling poor strategies to work and crippling intelligent ones.  The writing is god-awful in it's predictability, not to mention making no sense at all, with poor world-building and just no real feeling of being 'sucked in'. It's barely an RPG, in some sense, because you have very little control over anything, following the set lines of upgrades and leveling, where the differences are so slight between levels that you can't hardly tell anything changed (well, tank upgrades are more noticeable, I admit). The UI is needlessly slow and cluttered, trying to keep to the 'it's a book' theme and also be kind of folksy, instead of being organized for military efficiency like an RTS would be. The characters, even for a JRPG, lack any depth, act completely stupid, and are totally one note. What characters there are, anyway; most of your party have no more than a portrait and a few lines of dialogue to make them unique.   This is not meant to be a full detailed review, but just my impressions of everything wrong here; I wanted to like it, but from the get-go, it just baffled me constantly, with bad writing, poor characterization, and unique but ultimately boring, luck-based gameplay. I'll give you one example; the beginning of the game has the hero walking back into his hometown, which is evacuating, since it's near the border of their enemy who has just overrun their fortresses and launching a blitz on their nation. There is no panic, no grim determination, no fear; everything is light and airy, people are strolling like they are going to the bakery, the hero stops to make a sketch of fish (who kindly hold place for several minutes), etc. It's utterly and completely unbelievable, and not only ruins immersion, but makes the characters totally unrelateable, as they don't feel, think, or act the way real human beings would in the face of an invasion by an enemy that is basically a combination of Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia launching a blitzkrieg that just demolished the massive border forts.  So yeah; this is a good example of everything that is often wrong about JRPGs. The game runs, it looks and sounds good, it's got no major bugs I know of, but it's boring, luck-based, shallow, and predictable. It is all the things that WRPG fans accuse JRPGs of being. I can't recommend this to anyone but the most Japanese-obsessed fanatics."
"Very poor RPG - wise, can't skip cutscenes. This game is basically a movie with little to no difficulty. Buy it only if you are into lore/story kind of stuff."
"Good lord, I should've stopped months ago. I have no Idea what was I expecting. Story vomit aside, it's a very standart TRPG, that is spoiled by an attempt to attract the shooter crowd. It has no shooting mechanics, so the entire TPS aspect is useless, and horrible physics, which usually spoil gameplay, that would've been perfectly fine in classic TRPG clothes. Avoid, there's nothing to see here."
It's an alright game but the enemy will continue to fire even if you have a full magazine and a bunch of movement points. It doesn't make much logical sense when you can run everywhere with a loaded gun but can't fire more then one burst.
"Not fun. The gameplay is great, the characters are fun, the storyline is interesting, the setting is beautiful, and I could go on and on about the many great aspects of this game...but it's still a game that isn't fun to actually play. Specifically, the mission in which Welker and Alicia need to cross during the night is simply stupid. Mortars prevent you from progressing, even though you only have 20 turns. Searchlights find you regardless of how close you are (I stood and watched the circle get nearly touching to the character, but was found out without the same proximity) and enemies have magical abilities to shoot you without the same quality headshots and stay in the same cover your characters are in. It is at this point that I've had better luck with E.T. the videogame than this overrated turd of a game. If it didn't take 30 minutes with each attempt, I wouldn't feel like I wasted my whole day for zero progress.  I'd like my money back."
Great art style and good combat. Sadly dragged back by horrible voice acting and bloody terrible writing. Frustration throughout the game.
This game is pretty fun in the beginning but then it becomes very much a trail and error.  This game is a turn based tactical shooter sort of thing. I dont know any other games like this. But the fact that its turn based doesnt mean you cant be attacked on your turn. Every turn if you get into the enemies range (or the enemy gets into yours) you will be shot and take damage.  The computer cheats by ending his turn on time. While you cant really do it too like it does.  Also every level takes a long time and you can be ambushed and lose 40 minutes of progress because of 1 stupid soldier you just didnt see.  Overall I wont recommend it. 
2/10 I'd rather drink from a septic tank.
"As someone who is not invested in the franchise, I found the 1 second delay between every line of dialogue too annoying and distracting to continue playing/investing in the story.   For reference, i played with the japanes w/ english subtitles."
do not download this game it kill you fps when i play i only had 1 fps
cool 25Gb movie
"I tried liking Valkyria Chronicles, I really did. I spent 48 hours playing it and there’s a lot to like here, but the game ultimately proves too frustrating to be worth recommending. This is a game that’s it’s own worst enemy.   First, some of the highlights: - Unique gameplay that marries RPG elements with turn-based strategy. Think Final Fantasy meets Company of Heroes. - Interesting setting that can only be described as Dragonball Z meets World War II. - Good graphics and a varied campaign.  However, there are just too many things that bring the game down: - Two-dimensional characters that look and sound as if they were created by kids in junior high. Seriously, these people show more emotion when it comes to baking bread than when their entire national army is wiped out. - The classes are ridiculously unbalanced. Shocktroopers are amazing in 80% of situations whereas Scouts are useless in almost 100% of situations. In addition, 3 out of 5 classes don’t respond when enemies approach. They will quite literally just stand there and get shot in the head. - There is a ridiculous amount of randomness to when characters hit and when they miss. Leaving you to accept that either you're going to lose some battles out of pure chance or you’re going to have to totally cheese your way through the game, saving after every phase (or even after every turn). Unlike in games like XCOM there is no percentage indicator of a hit or miss. - The game is long and tedious. Going off of Steam achievements, only 38% of players get the first achievement and a puny 6% actually beat the game. In short, people just give up. - Tank controls are awful, leaving you to spend half of your movement points just trying to turn the thing in the right direction."
"Characters are nice, gameplay is terrible."
"Don't get me wrong, the port is good, the game is good too but I just hate there isn't way to skip enemy's turn, dude, literally 5 minutes of nothing."
"they accualy found a way to screw up turn baced mechanics , im speachless  EDIT: played a little more got to batomys boss fight killed all turrets and enemys during turn 3 and now im stuck he cant do damage and i cant do damage to him TURN AFTER TURN this game is BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD"
"this game lack of something that make it very annoying really see again and again and again the restart of chapter because i lose the battle really that sucks, but well apart of that.... game requieres a lot of strategy and luck, sniper have very low accuracy and only 1 bullet, they begin to hit good only being too near and that make snipers dont have good value( i had to use 3 times a sniper only to hit really). accuracy of opponent is kinda weird too i had been hit by a tank too far of where i was and my sniper couldnt even hit half that distance.   There are too many units so selecting units is kinda pain sometimes.  if you like games of strategy and have the patience of see again the intro of map well game for you, but i really dont recommend the game until i can skype that secuence again and again and again."
"The game would be great if only it could run in the background and didn't kill the mouse when it was running. As it is, these requirements make me unwilling to give up all the other functionality of my computer while watching a cutscene or something."
Horrible port. Clunky and frustrating. Avoid.
this was a much better game in 2008 on the ps3.
"I hate  Valkyria Chronicles  sooooo much, although this might be due to high expectations going in. I mean, look at the box cover: you're basically promised tank warfare in an anime WWII setting, right? Well it's a promise the game fails to deliver as various game mechanics conspire to ruin your enjoyment by removing all military logic from the experience.  Case in point, I'm now six chapters in and I still haven't used my tank outside of the tutorial. That's because the game is designed around a system of Action Points which determine how much a character does in a single turn. Unlike infantry, tank movement requires two Action Points rather than one. Furthermore, tanks are apparently NOT the fast moving units I was brought up to believe and are regularly outpaced by my scouts.  Sega  has given you a  beautiful  and somewhat realistic tank from a fantasy WWII point of view, then punishes your high score for wanting to use it.  (Apparently, your tank get's a little more mileage (oh, haw) in chapter seven... which is a game changing boss fight. So add poor level planning to the list of design flaws.)  (Or, it can be joked that  Valkyria Chronicles  represents an accurate portrayal of WWII tank warfare as performed by the French.)  My biggest problem with  Valkyria Chronicles  is how they treat victory conditions. Completing your mission objectives in a minimal amount of turns is all that matters, with the destruction of enemy units bearing little to no importance. Essentially, a war game that doesn't much reward you for defeating enemy soldiers. Never mind battlefield tactics such as cover fire or flanking movements; your best bet for a high score is often to rush out in the middle of the field and take the objective as quickly as possible, enemy fire be damned!  I hate the way the turn system is implemented! You start with a set number of Action Points per turn which you distribute to individual troopers, meaning you don't so much move as a formation but as a collection of individuals with special talents. I'd compare this game to  X-COM  but heavily skewed towards scouts as these maps are so large that the unit with the widest movement range has a clear advantage. It's not like they aren't equipped with grenades and heal potions anyhow, so damage/survivability isn't  that much  of an issue. There's a whole system behind 'orders', commands that give your soldiers a boost in their capabilities... but they cost Action Points, and you're not fighting the enemy so much as you're going from point A to point B  despite  them, so orders end up being pretty superficial.  (That boss fight in chapter seven I mentioned? I tried weighing in the pros and cons of using damage boost orders vs just firing a lot more times and bringing an engineer to reload. They're pretty gosh darn even in terms of strategies.)  As for the characters... Well I hate reviewing subjective matters but these are such a collection of tired,  DATED  clichés- From the sweet childhood friend with feelings for the hero but the hero is just too damn dense to realize it to the painfully shy NOT blood-related imouto bullied due to anime racism; add the non-threatening burly older guy to serve as the comedy ham (not to be confused with any actual hams/team mascots) and the bar maid big sister-type who's praised for her singing when all she does is go 'la la la la la la.... la la la la la la.... la la la la la' in a cutscene. Oh, and the hero's shtick of 'I'm comparing you to a bug but that's a compliment because I'm a naturalist' get's real old, real fast.  Your troops are even worse. Not only are they one-dimensional, some don't even fit within the context of the setting! EUROPE DIDN'T HAVE IDOLS, OR VALLEY GIRLS FOR THAT MATTER. That blond pompadour punk turned soldier just makes me realize that  Sega  simply wanted to have their collection of Japanese stereotypes but with different hair color under the justification that they're white Europeans now. I personally lost it when I heard the anime Nazis speak with an upper class  ENGLISH  accent. And now I'm at chapter seven and there's a forbidden cataclysmic weapon created by an ancient civilization- OH COME ON, YOUR GAME WAS DEVELOPED IN 2008, THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR THIS INANITY! If you won't have a single original thought in your horrible story, then at least give the chicks some decent ♥♥♥♥ to look at.  It's frustrating because of how a few changes could've made this a much better game. First, stop gimping the tank. Remember that infantry wins firefights but tanks win battles (and artillery wins wars). Make it the primary force of the squad, with infantry used to take out anti-tank nests. Second, make orders not cost Action Points but limit them to one a turn. Like in war, your CO is always yelling something but he can't yell too many different things or risk confusing the troops. Third, incentivize defeating the enemy. Duh. Fourth, either tone down your reliance on scouts or have them behave like spotters for the rest of your troops. Lord knows how many shots my lancers have missed....  I'm using a lot of help from internet walkthroughs because the ♥♥♥♥ in this game just doesn't make any sense! What I wanted was  Girls und Panzers  and what I got was tank captain Tree Hugger and the anime trope corps. Not even good tropes. It's a game that's offensive to the armchair general out there and which has nothing to offer to the anime fan. It's that bad, and I know I'm going to finish this game because I paid for it."
"This game has a lot going for it. Visualy it's pretty good, characters are nice, voices are from a pool of well known actors (though the japanese dialogue is better). Lots of content and an interesting Book menu interface.  Mechanically though it's terrible. Overly long battles, being shot at constantly during your turn (wait isnt this a tbs?), bad pathing with characters constantly getting stuck behind eachother or on invisible walls etc. The enemy AI is easily manipulated but can make shots you would otherwise miss over and over again-esepcially frustrating at the end of a battle when they 1HKO your tank (instant game over).  The story is decent but the mood is all over the place. It's often way too cheery for a game loosely based on WW2. Especially during every mission when your character jumps for joy with a smarmy remark after killing someone.  This seems more like a visual novel with a 3D tbs tacked on. I wouldn't reccomend this, too frustrating to want to go further."
"I bought this game with all its DLC from HumbleBundle.  I'm not an anime fan, but I gave it a go so I won't slate it for its art style.But here's a few negatives and positives:  - Misold on the steam page, nowhere does it say the game is 90% talking and 10% combat. - Don't mind turn based games, but this is a pathetic attempt. - Cringy talk scenes. - Poor game mechanics - Too much writing for the player to read instead of play.  Now everyone has their tastes, but I was bored throughout. I uninstalled it after the first tank appeared in battle, if you're happy to pay for an interactive book then here you go.."
Bascially a crap XCOM... Had so much promise but is a typical case of the idea being better than the execution. Very dissapointed.
PUT A ♥♥♥♥IN REWIND FEATURE IN   FIGHTING THE SAME BATTLE I JUST SPENT AN HR ON OVER AGAIN IS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.
"Beware this console port. It runs, but you quickly get to a point in the menus where you can't go any further . I've pressed every key and clicked everywhere on the screen with no result. Looks like it needs a game controller to navigate, but I don't own one and have no plans to get one. Too bad."
"An interesting gameplay mode that is utterly overwhelmed by the poor porting, the glacial pacing, and the 'totally-not-mid-20th-century-europe-trust-us' setting.   i can see why this game gets so much love from critics, there really is an interesting game here, but the storytelling and implementation is so hamfisted that it's hard to get to the good parts."
Bascially a crap XCOM... Had so much promise but is a typical case of the idea being better than the execution. Very dissapointed.
"Faulty port, randomly delete save games yet when supposedly it saves in your pc AND the cloud, there isnt a fix for this, i lost 40+ hours to this faulty port. there is no customer support, no answer in forums, nothing.  if you want to try, the game itself its very good, but the randomly save deleting totally kill the game, unless you save your files from your pc to a new folder cuz, otherwise you gonna have a very unpleasant experience when the game go nuts and do the thing: 'OOOpps those were your save files with 50+ hours and newgame+? awww such a shame. start from zero, sucker. and you see that cloud thing? its only a bad joke to give false hopes than really works'  really dont play this unless you are backing manually your saves each time you close the game."
"+The basic combat system is well executed. - the characters and dialogue are weak - the tone is very light-hearted for a game about war - the missions are cheezy. Invicible valkyria warrior slaughters all your forces while you wait for a giant tank to fight it's main gun, so you can attack it's weak point. Not fun."
"Beautiful artwork and character designs. Terrible battle mechanics. Battles are drawn out to a ridiculous degree because every single character has to be given orders separately and then you wait for the enemy to make each single move too. Except on defense when everyone in range will fire automatically. You can't command troops to hold fire on defense, so if an enemy is behind cover, your troops waste a whole clip shooting at the cover then get caught reloading when the enemy moves into open ground. Annoying.  Not having the ability to move a group at once makes for stupid situations. Say you have a tough single enemy and 4-5 troops. You can't move them together. You send each troop one by one to attack each turn. What's the point of a squad if you can't use squad movements and tactics? Lame.  I really want to like this game, but the battle system is broken."
"Pretty game but could use some works on usability.  First of all the canvar art style is unique and should be praised about. Not deny that.  Game mechanic, however, needs a bit of polishing. For example, the lack of indication on whether your heroes are getting defense bonus from landscape could make your heroes die in a turn and leading to mission failure. While this may not be a deal breaker to veteran players, it does discourage new players to experiment with the game more as it leads gameplay more to luck.  The FPS style of unit action is a double edged sword. It's more intuitive but at the same time it's harder to backtrack when you make mistakes. And often these mistakes are made due to FPS elements such as camera angle and targetting.  Overall, this is an interesting take on a strategy game. But the game feels very unpolished. [6.5/10]"
"Terrible, Gameplay is horrid. Characters AI is absolutely rediculous and cant aim for their lives (literally) while enemy AI is well scripted and apparently can shoot you with an smg from accross the battle ground. waste of money and i seriously want a damn refund for this ♥♥♥♥"
"maybe a good game but this white borders annoy me to much to play it further , why oh why was there the need of this crap ?"
"Not that great, and kind of boring."
"The Game mechanics are good (except unlimited enemy interception fire). Combat is Good. Art is nice, music is good. The plot is as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as an inbred hamster with fetal alchol syndrome and a double lobotomy.  Spoiler:    Your sister dies because you decide to just stop right after combat and hop out to fix the undamaged tank, without securing the area. Only way to show evils of racism to a teammate though apparently   You let the enemy supervillian escape after she's beat down.   Buildings of civillians burn down, so you waste time pontificating on the nature of racism and evils of war before eventually being shamed into LOOKING FOR SURVIVORS   An ally shoots your teammate in the battlefield, and merely gets a little (10 days) jail time for his treason.   Your captain takes you on an unsanctioned assassination mission to get revenge for her personal issues, has to be physically prevented from a field execution, but later punishes you for striking the traitor that shot your 2ic   You beat the enemy supervillian again, let her talk instead of finish her (though 3 50cal shots to the head and 0hp isn't dead for her even when unpowered), let her dictate terms, then she nukes your main army   You then feel sorry for HER when she does that      Typical jrpg idiotball to railroad you to a preachy plot. I'd like to say I enjoyed it, but the plot kept making me delay playing it."
"I feel obligated to write my own, negative opinion of this game to avoid other people being misled as I was by the huge amount number of positive reviews.  This is a console game port. It is designed to be played with a gamepad. Like any turn based tactics game designed for console, everything is slower to do than you expect it to be as a PC game. Combat mechanics are simplistic. This is in no way a hardcore game, or even as complex as the new XCOM, for that matter.  Well if you aren't playing it for the deep gameplay then i guess its for the... story?   Honestly I couldn't care less about these characters. All the girls look and act like 12 year olds, except that they are portrayed as gun carrying solders literally shooting people to death during gameplay. What the hell is this, a story about child solders? They mix in enough destruction and death to get your attention but cover it in a kid-friendly vineer that just comes accross as offensive.  Actually reminds me a lot of several other japanese 'cutscene heavy' games, like metal gear.  If you played the metal gear series for its storyline and emotion-filled, believable chracters and cutscenes, then you'll love this game. Alternately, if like me, you had to quit playing metal gear after 30 minutes because your sympathetic embaressment on behave of the creative director was causing you physical pain, then you should probably avoid this game."
"Valkyria Chronicles is like a mix between X-com and Fire Emblem but way worse than both of those games in almost every aspect.   If you're trying to chose whether to buy this one or X-Com, ask yourself if you value a poorly executed love story, written by someone who failed their history exam, over actual gameplay. If you do, this might be the game for you, if not, try X-com instead.  Also, while playing this game, I couldn't help but noticed that a fair amount of our squad were underaged and that 2/3 of the lovely sub-commanders sympathized with the in-game equivalents of nazis. And I thought we were supposed to be the good guys!"
it just about luck so no strage its ♥♥♥♥
"rating: a  waste of time   Overwhelmingly positive on steam? This is a game full of bad design decisions, annoyances and anime clichés. I can see why this game might be appealing to some people (as it was for me) and first you think 'hey this is actually an interesting combat system', but later you will realize that the game is just full of random mechanics (I will explain this in a later section).    Bad Design Decisions"
Do you like anime? I will kill you where you stand.
Missions are designed poorly.
Buy this awesome game and get anime butts plastered onto your steam front page. Because my want to drive tanks and shoot people must mean I lust for a waifu
Cutscene Chronicles.  Seriously. Endless cutscenes.   Cutscene.  Want to upgrade your troops? Cutscenes and slow dialogue. Want to start a new battle? Cutscenes and dialogue. Want to rescue a downed soldier? Cutscenes.  Cutscene.  Pros:  -Pleasant graphics -Core gameplay is fun  Cutscene.  Cons: -Gameplay is sparse and constantly interrupted by slow dialogue and cutscenes. -Story failed to engage me. I was mashing the skip cutscene button after the first 10 minutes. -Cutscenes -To advance the 'story' you must select the next cutscene to play. After a story cutscene it boots you all the way back to the mission selection screen. First you have to click through a couple announcements (NEW GLOSSARY TERMS ADDED!) then you play more cutscenes. You watch 3 -5 cutscenes before you unlock a battle.  -Interface/menu/Save&amp;Load are clunky.  Cutscene.  3/Cutscene10
xcom for weebs
"This game is no fun at all. You are constantly trying to defeat an arbitrary 'Ooooh you only have 20 turns to win this mission so HURRY HURRY HURRY.'  This game isnt about tactis or trial and error, its simply about a bunch of incompetent devs who want to kick your butt to fight their artificial 20 turn limit in each game. Stinks. Avoid this consolitis like the plague"
sorry but no.
I do not like this game and how it plays. There are no tactics it is simply trial and error. Fail and keep failing missions until you know exactly where the enemies are and what type of enemies they are. Then you scout rush and ignore all other enemies so you can quickly cap the objective. Rinse and repeat. Sure you can take your time and have half you team die but rushing is optimal to minimize losses. Don't bother moving Welkin around either because if he dies it's game over. Funny that you're forced to use him every mission in his tank and yet the best thing you can do is NOT use him!  What I was looking for was a strategy game that you have to adapt to survive. This is not the case. There is one maybe two optimal ways to complete a mission and that's it. There is no room for creativity. I could take the full twenty turns to complete a mission with no deaths and mostly hotshots clearing out all enemies. Do you get a high rank for being thorough? No you get high rank for rushing and barely engaging enemies.  I wanted to like this game I really did and I gave it a fair shot but I just can't wrap my head around this game and how to play it. It isn't fun for me.
"Do not buy this game, it cheats with invicible enemy units guarding the victory objective. It is fun until that time. Do not waste your money."
"While it's a fun game in it's own right, it becomes repetitive very quickly. Not much more to say.  I stopped playing it after 3.4 hours."
has a good story but way bad well 1. 30 fps lock yes ya heard me right  2. characters move so slow like they seen medusa 3. dont even dare tell me about the breach mission there is no way to win  that explains it all good concept but man is it bad
"This game was a huge disappointment. I was expecting something more...dynamic, interesting, free.  Not worth the money and time :("
"I've yet to play through the entire game yet, but I believe I've played enough to say 'Valkyria Chronicles' just isn't worth the price.  The game's plot is a hokey, cringeworthy affair that really does its source material a disservice (World War II). Perhaps there are some people who appreciate juvenile Japanese cartoons and characters, but I'm not one of them. Also, it must be so easy for the Japanese to highlight German atrocities in a video game and none of their own. What, was the '♥♥♥♥ of Nanking' too close to the bone or something?  More importantly, I have huge problems with the gameplay. 'Valkyria Chronicles' appears to pride itself on tactics and strategy, but none of these play into the game's mission ranking system. You're given multiple units with a variety of skills and abilities but to achieve the best possible outcome, you're only allowed to use one or two of them in a single turn? C'mon, guys.  Want to play a better strategy game? Go for 'XCOM: Enemy Unknown.'"
"It's a f**king anime game, nuff said."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a good game if not at least a decent game. The art is nicely done, the gameplay is solid and unique, the voice acting (japanese) is good.   Why i dont recommed it is only because this game does not have a proper subtitle for the Japanese Voice, whats included in the game is english subtitle based on english script. While you might not notice any diferent if you play with english voice and subtitle, the truth is the english script is not the original script, its not just japanese original script translated to english, it is by all means a modified script.   So for you who can understand japanese a little from watching anime you will find this very disturbing since the modified script also change the character personalities by changing the dialog. For example you will find cooler Welkin when playing this game with english voice, but if you watch the anime and play this game in japanese voice you should know the original Welkin is a very decent and polite gentleman type in manner of speaking.  For you who dont mind about this fact feel free to purchase the game, if not i suggest to wait till this game get some update or just ask your friend to share it via family share so you can try the game first."
Overrated garbage  Yeah im not going to watch 5 scenes of crappy anime with horribly dumb characters and plot just to play 1 battle with mediocre gameplay. Thank god I bought it on sale and didnt waste too much money on it.
"Honestly I almost never even bother taking time to review games I either like or dislike but for this I made an exception.  This has to be the worst, and most dissapointing game I have purchased since FF XIII-2. Usually despite that I will at least play the game to completion simply for the sake of not wasting the money I spent, but I cant even bring myself to want to even look at this steaming pile of garbage that most people seem to like.  The characters are flat, and the gameplay is just flat out annoying. I like games with a tactical battle system. like FF Tactics and Disgae. This combat system is like a mix between tactical and FPS that just to me fails completely.  In short don't waste your money."
"Looked like a really fun game, but was actually quite boring. The strategy part was pretty meh. The first person mode was what really made me bored. If there was only strategy then I could of been like it was an ok tactical rpg. But with the first person it became completely boring."
♥♥♥♥
"Yet another stupid Japanese game.  It has a potentially great game design with an interesting story line, and also the game is pretty polished. However, you need to follow a certain set of skills otherwise you will eventually waste your time and realise you'll need to restart from the beginning. It is just rude and absurd.  So my recommendation is 1) DO NOT BUY THIS, 2) Or read a fine manual which skills you need to select before you start. You may get spoiled but nothing will be really important than your time."
Game sucks delete end of story! -0/10
"PROS: SRPG  CONS: Art style lack of engaging story iffy controls too lightharded Not deep enough mechanics  I did not enjoy this game. I wanted too, and tried to, but it did not resonate with me. Maybe I have outgrown anime, I am not certain. It was too lightharded for the situation. My only incentive to keep playing was to free up 20 gigs from my SSD, the story was a wash. I was disappointed after hearing all the good things about this game, and also after dumping thousands of hours into other SRPGs like Disgaea and Final Fantasy Tactics."
"DO NOT BUY. Huge game ruining mechanic - forced cutscenes. Imagine playing chess with a cpu, and you have to literally wait 5 minutes for them to think.   I'm stuck on one mission where you fight a big tank. Not stuck because it's hard, stuck because I have to wait. I can't damage the enemy until it reaches a certain point, so I gotta wait. The enemy takes roughly 20 hits, so wait for that. The enemy can destroy my main unit in one hit, so make sure you hide and wait too. The tactics should be in choosing what to do, how to approach the enemy and how to train your men. This takes about 2 minutes compared to 30 minutes of waiting.  I might be too hard on them though...they managed to recreate one of the important aspects of war, the calm before the storm. The waiting makes you get sloppy and just kamikaze in. If you want a challenge (for your patience), play this game."
"The story is being told exceptionally well. I would even say 75% of the content centers around the story line.  The bad sides: - You are not going to get any hint if the shot is going to hit or not. Well, you think it is going to hit but some random invisble mesh within the line of fire will block your shot. At least give me some percentage indicator. - In fights there is often no choice rather it is an orchestral play that needs excact timing like that fight against the huge ♥♥♥ tank in chapter ~7. I do rather like open stages where my soldiers are just tools to my weird play."
  difficulty spikes very high very early and can become very fustrating when there is so many other things you could be playing
"Do the PC ever stop getting to shoot at you? They shoot at you before you move, when you move, when you fire, and after you fire. You only shoot them when they move, when they fire, and thats it. Have them shoot an equal amount of times as my troopers and then I can talk to you people about how I feel I wasted 20 bucks on lazy developers who didnt really give a tall grass about making it a strategy with a little bit less of idiotic computer advantages."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a failed attempt to combine anime with the great strategic joys of games like the highly acclaimed Advance Wars. This clunky example of everything wrong with console gaming and its inevitable PC port should be a wake up call to developers looking for examples of why console gaming needs to change. I wanted to love this game but horrible interface and terrible inconsistent gameplay mechanics lead to deep frustration even when you are told you've succeeded. I encounters several technical glitches also including in game crashing which transmits an incredibly vulnerable feeling piece of software. Ultimately Valkyria Chronicles feels like your best friends a$$hole girlfriend and yet he still loves her despite her glaringly abundant flaws. If I could say anything conclusively towards a recommendation, simply put you can do better than this lazy entry into a deeply intelligent genre."
If u hate everything what japan this game will make u hate that japan stupidity even more. Stay far far away from this CRAP.
I read the hype and believed it. Mug. This is not a turn based game in the true sense. You cant sit and think over your move becuase the enemy shoots at you. Plus all the guff inbetween battles is annoying. This is not a great game it is just innovative but I am disappointed to have spent my money on it. Dont buy it if you like good turn based games unless it comes down to less than £5. Wasted download wasted money.
Scout rush the game.
"Oh my god. The sheer number and idiocy of the cutscenes in this game make it almost unplayable. That's a shame too, because the actual gameplay is pretty fun, if you can ever get to it."
This game sucks. Not worth its price. Wish I got it for free.
A typically poor port from a console. Trying to navigate through this mess is very painfull. I give up.
"this ♥♥♥♥ing game is ♥♥♥♥ing horrible   the writing is so CRINGE, i shut it off and never played again after the angel/god character was introduced.  having a forced unit in every map sucks because it's a TANK a boring ♥♥♥♥ing mechanical character controlled by some freak who makes me want to puke moms spaghetti. he is supposed to be a child in a war and acts like a child at disney land  the best part of this whole game was when the main characters sister dies. im not even being cynical, its the only part of the game that was good and it was a good ♥♥♥♥ing part of the game  the battles all suck and are not rewarding at all. the enemy AI nearly never misses, a lot of battles were cheesed by exploiting line of sight and close quarter combat"
"if you enjoy bosses with magical plot armour and the game suddenly introducing characters in a semi-realistic war story who can deflect tank shells with a magical lance you might want to get your head examined, oh, and you might enjoy this terrible game, too.  anime trash/10"
  didnt play this game as much i wanted to. maybe its good but i lost the interest. so cant help with a review. just doing ot to get the badge;)
"One of only a handful of games that I have stopped playing without getting reasonably into. Terrible gameplay broken up with a barrage of anime tropes so cringeworthy the writing's mediocrity eclipses the decent character and setting design. This game attempts to merge real time strategy and first person shooting and fails completely, delivering the worst of both worlds along with a heap of logical inconsistencies. This is probably the worst game that I've ever had the misfortune of playing. It reads like bad fanfiction. I implore you, save your money for a game even remotely worth your time, that being pretty much anything else.  TL;DR Terrible game. If you like the art, go watch anime. If you like the gameplay, go play XCOM."
"TL;DR: Horrible port, mediocre game. Fun strategy ruined by nonsensical, constricting game design and completely bland characters and setting. If you want to try it, get it on console.  The negative rating and TL;DR aside, I'm going to start with the PC port of this game. I'm going to ramble a bit but bare with me.  I don't know about you, but I'd never played FFXIII, as I went to PC during the rise of the PS3 and 360 in my teenage years, and as such, when it was ported to PC and released on Steam, I gave it a fair try, and for the £10 it was being sold at, it seemed fair.   Moments into PC FFXIII, as I'm sure many other people found out as well, I found that the maximum resolution was 720p. I was highly dissapoinited in not having an option as simple as resolution, but I could play it in Windowed mode and do other things too, so that was fine. Later on, I tried to get out of the in-game options menu by hitting the escape button, only to find that I had been released from the clutches of the options menu, by the escape key closing down the entire game, my objective fulfilled whilst also having my aim to actually play the game being ♥♥♥♥ on. Coupled with my discovery of a 30fps frame limit and no sound options of any kind, FFXIII was already off to an incredibly poor start.  However, I made compensations here and there, such as using the Windows Volume Mixer and sheer determination to at least give the game itself a fair try, and over time, I came to find that I really rather enjoyed the game, the story (despite the climax of the story being the stupidest ♥♥♥♥ing thing I've ever seen) and I even liked Hope, as he progressed into a very likeable character who was the core motivation for the other characters.  Fast forward a few months, and I see Valkyria Chronicles on Steam, too. On sale, no less and having heard that it was a interesting series that was pretty decent from various friends and other people, so I elected to give it a try under another of the 'Console JRPGs from the 360 Generation I've missed' category. This list is upsettingly large. And this morning, I installed the game whilst taking a nap and booted it up to find that, instead of being deafened by default, I can configure the game before booting. Wicked. Oh wait, never mind, there's just graphics options.  At this point, my standards being lowered curtousey of the FFXIII port, I was most impressed that there were actual graphics options, though limited, but I can at least set my resolution to 1920*1200, and I can even set my framerate to... 30... fps... (My dear friends disagree with me here and say that 30fps is better than literally everything above it. I think otherwise)  ...Right, well, I put that at 'Refresh rate', but I have a feeling the game will be capped at 30 most of the time regardless.  I booted up the game to notice two things: I am now midly deaf, because the volume defaults to full, and my resolution option was a complete lie, as it is actually 1920*1080, with hideous black borders on the top and bottom of the screen. The lazy ♥♥♥♥♥. Having discovered that there are no mouse controls to speak of, and the keyboard controls are wonky at best, I rebooted the game with my controller plugged in, in the hopes that it would work. It does.   With controller in place and ears numb, I navigated my way to the options menu, and turned *all* the sound volume down to 20% or less, and turning on Japanese voice acting, which I was quite happy was in, as Jap voice acting tends to be superior to English. Now I've set my volume to a reasonable level and begun the game, I've noticed something; I am, once again, deaf, as apparently the volume controls affect only roughly 40% of the actual game at best: the menus and the in-game combat. This wouldn't sound like a bad thing, but there was such a vast amount of maxed out volume exposition, I had to alter the volume through other means, which is absurd.  This is, in fairness, about where the moaning about the port ends, sort of, since all the aforementioned problems remain and recurr, but infairness to the port, the quality of it doesn't get any worse. However, going back on my thoughts at the start, Final Fantasy XIII was a higher quality port than Valkyria Chronicles. I didn't think that anything could be physically worse than that port, I honestly didn't, but Valkyria Chronicles is easily now my number 1 worst port in history.  Port quality - 2/10, if I have to give a numerical value. Incidentally, all of my complaints about both ports were fixed in the FXIII port with an update, and ports of the later games in the series are of vastly higher quality, to be actually rather good ports. Good job, Square Soft, many props for listening to your consumer base and fixing your game's problems.  Now, onto the game, as this is where the story continues. Or begins, with a man drawing some fish to the looks of worried villagers nearby, who think that this man with the obsession of fish is a bit strange. In fairness to them, he probably is, and the main love interest, who walks onto the scene next seems to think so too, and tries to arrest him out of sheer disgust. Or at least I'd like to think so, much of the dialogue was really quite funny and enjoyable, but almost always for the wrong reasons, like when taken out of context. I'm still not sure whether this is a point in Valkyria Chronicles' favour, it probably isn't, but I was still enjoying the game so far so hey ho.   Roughly thirty minutes of exposition and terrifying disembodied heads that float around the screen later, I actually get to play the game, isn't that nice? and it starts off with an obligatory tutorial mission, which is perfectly fine and good. Having found out about crouching behind sandbags before the game tells me I can, I wonder aloud why I can't crouch or hop over anything else of near-waist height. My friend on Teamspeak at this point tells me 'That's just how the game is.'  'Oh, right then.' I reply. Never mind, I guess they were too idly to adapt the cover system to the rest of the objects in the world, but I can try to overlook this rather hefty flaw given just how gorgeous the game is, as it really is a very pretty game. Having completed the tutorial mission, I go on to what I hope is more missions and fighting my way out of Poland, as Germany has invaded, and instead find that I get to watch yet more dialogue about the hometown that is entirely inconsequential and various other things, for a very long time, longer than all the introductory scenes, in fact, and at this point I'm beginning to lose interest in the characters because I JUST WANT TO GET MY BLUE FIREMEN TO SHOOT SOMETHING. PLEASE, LET ME PLAY THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME.   I understand that JRPGs have exposition and story telling, and I very much like that about them, but at least make the story interesting. I, among many other people, I hope, already know at least generally what happens in WWII, and though the events have been adapted for this newish story, the characters so far have been entirely uninteresting as well. Fast forward through the first couple of missions, I'm finally playing the game, and skipping most scenes as I can read the dialogue subtitles faster than they speak it, which is nice. (Oh, I remembered something. In all the disembodied head cutscenes, ALL the dialogue makes horrible pop-in sounds every time the sound file is played. Outstanding.)  Enough of my story as it gets fairly repetetive, in parallel with the game itself (OOHH), so I'll just get onto what the gameplay is like, as I can finally do that now.  It's fun. It's not brilliant or entirely unique (though in this day and age it's increibly hard to make something truly unique), but it is certainly fun. The AI is peculiar and the game sometimes lies to you. There's some flaws, like invsible walls and the crap cover/ interactions, but it's fun. Just not fun enough to warrant finishing the game.   4/10"
"I bought this because it was discribed as an RPG.  It isn't.  The story is progressed by a load of cutscenes interspaced with a fairly simplistic turn-based battles. Outside of the battles you have no control over your charicter. The game has its fun moments but its about as much of an RPG as playing a game of chess after watching an episode of your favorate show.  The art is nice but quite basic in the battles. The game mechanics are like a poor mans X-com, fun but with most of X-coms choices taken away.  I really don't think this deserves Steams 96% rating, even the story is remarkably basic (some people without any experiance with JRPG's or Anime may find it a bit hard to follow but not due to complexity.)  I feel more than a little cheated tbh, imagine buying cheese from the supermarket and find out its Yogurt when you get it home, Technicaly its close, both are processed cow's milk. The same with this game, its not an RPG its a turn based combat game with lots of cutscenes.  &lt;edit&gt; having now finished the game I can stand by the original review. The difficulty curve also seems a little off (mission 7 was a massive ramp up, later missions a cakewalk.).   The Ranking system that rewards you with a grade at the end of a mission and calculates the rewards is only based on how many rounds, not tactics or losses so listening to the briefing at the beginning of a battle can trick you into a lower rank.  The game is fun most of the time. It is worthy of a cheap purchase. Don't expect a JRPG experiance."
"What a piece of buggy crap, can't even play with the stupid menu keep switch up and down none stop, another fail port, last console port i'll ever ever buy on crapsteam"
What kind of game forces you through normal mode to unlock hard mode? 1/10.
"Holy crap this game is terrible. The interface must have been bad even on a console, the port is just atrocious. And it runs like crap. Like someone took a console game and dipped it in molasses. And it's got issues running at a decent resolution."
Boring as hell. I only bought this game because of the great reviews but man the game is increadibly boring.
"♥♥♥♥ game, more and longer cutscenes than MGS with the absolute ♥♥♥♥♥iest story I've ever seen.  - 'Kawaii' 19-year old militia leader girl. Rawwwr, hear me roar. - Disgusting story driven on a love interest, makes me gag. - ♥♥♥♥ this game, 0/10"
"The short: I can't recommend this game. It starts out strong and then falls flat on its' face roughly halfway through.   *SPOILER WARNINGS*    Basically, I loved the game completely. Until Alicia   became a valkyria  . That was the turning point of the game for me. All of the characterisation that Welkins and Alicia both had just went flying out the window and they both began to act with the maturity levels and general common sense of young children. Faldio just guilt trips himself for doing the best possible thing in the situation that has no negative repercussions, Welkins hates him because Alicia turned out good and wasn't even   shot in a fatal location, she was perfectly fine in the tent!  . And Alicia just... good lord. She's so angsty you could slice bread with that edge.  It feels as if the original writers were fired and a bunch of mid-school fanfic writers were hired in their place for all of the sudden tone and character shifts.  The Missions start off great and vary between good and great quality up to this point as well, and it's then that the quality takes as severe a dip as the story. The missions just become slogs that require you to either chew through infinitly respawning enemies or grinding skirmishs in order to get exp and money to use cheese tactics. The final 3 missions are particularly noteworthy in just how tedious they become, one of which is literally nothing more than 'Sit in one spot and shoot for about ten turns.'  I wanted to like this game. And I DID until that sudden dip in quality. But I just can't recommend it, it feels like such a bait &amp; switch. :("
"Initial reactions is that the game is too slow. I havent played it much to be honest, so i wouldnt recommend if you're busy.  &gt;Its heavy as hell 16gb, even while the graphics are very basic so i dont know whats weighing this thing down.  &gt;Feels like a port and not a native PC game so Controller if you have one vs KB + Mouse  Looks like there is a compelling story so far its told very well."
"Great game in terms of concept and art. Just terrible execution. So many bugs that make it harder essentially by breaking the game's own rules. Had a ramp in one of the later missions just not work but still eat up AP. Overall, the game is dated so I guess it was 'good for its time'. Nonetheless, if you like tactical strategy, you can't pass this game up.  UPDATE: Finished the game, started a new game plus, only to find the next day that the save file vanished. Some bugs are just unforgivable. If you think it's okay to pay for a buggy game, go for it. I don't think the game is good enough to warrant putting up with a crappy port. There are workarounds to the save bug but doesn't seem to be fair to have to fix a game for the devs."
"Fun game but cashes a lot at the end of stages, pretty much unplayable for me now."
"+ Visual style, Clean UI, Voice acting - Slow pace, Overabundance of features, Too many cutscenes  Although this game looks great, it isn't well executed and it collapses under the weight of its own features. The main thrust of the game are turn-based missions where you control a squad of soldiers. Interspersed between those missions are cutscenes, usually about half a dozen. Some of these are interesting, but many are frivolous (oh you have a new soldier that is a pig? Hilarious) and have to be watched (but can be skipped). However, between each mission there is probably about half an hour of cut-scenes. This means you have the choice of watching inane scenes (with the occasional interesting one) or skipping them and not knowing what is going on. I don't know which is worse.  Then there is the battle mode. There are a whole bunch of issues when managing the squad and using them in battle. The main aspect you need to concern yourself with is getting as close to the enemy as possible (range is mainly what accuracy is based on) whilst keeping out of their fire arc (since most soldiers auto-fire at anyone in front of them). Some weapons, such as rifles, are better at longer range and one troop type (Lancer) is effective at taking out tanks. That's basically the battle mode.  There are many minor concepts to manage within the squad, but in the end you will likely end up ignoring most of them. There is a levelling system, but the changes are invisible so you have no idea which class is better to upgrade for your play-style. Some players might find it exciting to take a soldier that is more accurate in grass/road or something and place them on the grass/road. However, keeping out of sight / behind sandbags is probably more important, so you'll probably just ignore that feature.   You'll likely just have a mix of the classes and hope that the they end up in a favourable situation (like the aforementioned road/grass). Then if you win the battle, you have to go back to your headquarters and manage everything again by sticking some points into equipment upgrades. The upgrades generally just increase damage or resistance rather than adding any extra tactical options. If you die, it is usually due to trying to keep within the time limit or because you don't understand some gameplay feature. A classic is that you can take cover behind sandbags, but not rubble. You won't make that mistake twice.  Overall, this looks nice but I can't recommend it due to the frustration of lack of depth and slow gameplay."
"I assume there's a game somewhere under all these cut-scenes, but I can't find it."
"Very disapponited.  I purchased the game because it was labeled as turn-based (among other reasons).  It's not turn-based.   There are some turn-based aspects.  However, damage to your units occurs in real-time.   The graphics are quite nice.   Control of unit movement is very poor. Even basic WASD movement fails to move a unit in the desired direction. Perhaps the mouse and keyboard are expected to be used in unison, to steer.   I have zero interest in a game in which I'm being shot at while 'doing nothing' (during a unit's turn, the unit may be continually shot at, until the unit initiates targeting - which may be done once per unit-activation.   The production quality is high. Some may enjoy this game.  However, it's not a game in which one may ponder tactics, at leisure.  Prior to moving a unit, it can be unclear whether the unit will find cover, until it is being shot at in real-time, and you must then search for cover in real-time.   The game could have been immensely improved with one design change : rather than having player-units shot at in real-time, enemy firing could be based on player useage of action-points. For example, every 3 meters of player movement, an enemy may take a shot. That's overly simplistic, but conveys the general idea.  That way, a player could stop moving, and ponder what to do.   II played for about 20 minutes, which will be my grand total."
"Was really looking forward to this. Finally came out on PC, yay!  Very disappointed. 2/10. Definitely try before you buy.  It's not really a 'tactics' game. It's a puzzle game. Each mission is in a small enclosure with one or two approaches to the enemy base. Get a guy into the enemy base - you win, the game just instantly ends. How do you get them in there?  By understanding the one combination of troops and movements the game intends you to use, usually based on ignoring tactics and logic and sense and every character in the game except one, taking that one really good scout and running her past gangs of enemy tanks and squads of armored soldiers to that base in one or two turns (maybe sniping a couple of guys on the way with your sniper, maybe using her grenade) so you can change their flag and magically make the enemy army decide to ♥♥♥♥ off.  Doing anything else gets you less money and experience, ie. punished for playing any way other than intended.  So, yeah. Don't be fooled. It's a narrow, uninspired puzzle game based on repeating the same procedure every mission. There are SNES games with deeper tactical gameplay (Der Langrisser, go crazy, it's amazing).  The story is standard anime BS, no surprises there. The presentation (a series of 30 second v/o and dialogue box clips of talking heads that you select from a book) screams 'half-finished', also 'Nintendo DS'. The save/system interface is also awkward and half-finished.  I have no idea how this didn't get panned at release then repanned when it came out on PC."
Overhyped Peace of Junk! Played till Mission 7 where the bullsh*t started. Mission 7 Start with fighting a Tank that is taking days to get distroyed.  After a while he gets backup in form of Mrs Undead. She cant be killed. and she runs in the speed if sonic and 1 hit every unit. This Game is just a bad Try and Error Game.  Story is going from WW2 to the second half of Sword Art Online (which is fantasy ♥♥♥♥)  dont buy it pls
"I enjoyed the first missions, they made some kind of sense. Train, choose, deploy all that good stuff. But later on this becomes a cheezefest."
Can only throw a grenade 10ft.  Update: Don't be mad at a review.
Disgusting Federation propaganda. The Empire did nothing wrong.
"Had High hopes and been wanting it for years for me to just find out its an poorly optimized poorly ported game that has really bad design choices and physics. Could only bare half the story because it was just so slow and cutscene heavy on top of that. gameplay is only decent, could be better if not for the fact that if your not in someones face you can barely shoot them because bullets fly everywhere and the worst offenders are the Tanks ( you think it would be accurate but when its clutch time it misses) and Snipers ( Masters of shooting targets miles away as advertised cant even shoot enemies across the street sometimes because game like making shots Just miss the target. only garrenteed the headshot if the whole circle invelopes the target which at that point might as well send scouts in to kill than a sniper) and the worst soliders are the Lancers i must say, because for carrying giant lance rocket launchers they cant do any damage to other soliders, limiting usefulness, and sometimes miss tanks but oh when they hit tanks have two points of damage, treeds and body with treeds taking up a good portion of the bottom and contributing nothing to kill ( it makes it where tanks can barely move once but isnt useful when under the time limit, better to just blow up) and the only saving grace is most tanks ( and theyre are tanks that dont have them) have radiators on the back that do critical damage when shot....even though you never get chances to shoot at them with tanks or lancers because walking up to a tank is suicide for everyone except your tank because for each second infront of a tank you lose 1/4 health pretty much. and this is bad because they waste your time in a game that grades and ranks you on how many turns it takes to kill every enemy and take every objective which sometimes is nuts to even get A in my opinion. but oh they are rare arent they? no...no they arent, they are in nearly every mission after being introduced for two reason which one is actually viable and good reason. 1. they put it in to justify Lancers existance ( Bad) and 2. they are historically correct seeing as hitler used blitzkreig to takeover smaller nations like the empire (original name btw) would for gallia. The biggest thing that got to me was just the fact it had so potiental to be good but it falls short because poor choices and a story thats so tar slow i had to stop when they looked like they were thinking of picking up, maybe bareable if someone mods if to have good gameplay?...all in all if your looking for a Modern Fire Emblem, look elsewhere. if your looking at a game that focuses on anime, war, and teen drama then heres your match  Summary:  GamePlay- 2/10  for being fun at first until poor gameplay choices like aim effect your mission score Story- 1/10  for being Tar slow ( for what i seen ) then tries to pick up after hours after gameplay already beats you down Mechanics - 4/10  for having some good mechanics but not working on them enough then just having some terrible mechanics as well UI - 0/10  For having really bad choices in design like not being able to leave missions without having to have saved before hand since it sends you to the main menu and just really bad UI because its a port meaning alot of simpilifacation because was orginally on 360 or PS3 ( idr which)  All in All - 3/10 only because Big conversion Mods could save it, i mean making good gameplay would make story barely to point of lasting through it all"
"Engine, art and character design, and PC port quality are all great.  Plot and dialog are decent, but pretty simple and cliché. (Honestly, the localization seems better than the original dialog.)  Actual gameplay is incredibly disappointing. Level design is unbearably linear, static, and inappropriate for the genre. Most game mechanics are interesting but poorly implemented. Upgrades and unlocks are based on time trial and occasional easter eggs, but also rarely affect the game.  It's not exactly terrible; your mileage may vary. I gave it several chances, though."
"I wanted to like this game. I really, really did. But, the gameplay is so awful that I just can't. Everything else (story, art design, character design, etc) is great. However, the broken controls, abysmal enemy AI, boring missions, glitches, etc. make this one of the few games I've actually become disgusted with. I can't bring myself to play it any longer.  The fact that it is categorized as a strategy game only adds insult to injury. Putting this game in the same category as XCOM, Civilization, and other great turn-based strategy games is a joke. There is barely any strategy to be found here.  Maybe it was good when it came out. I don't know. This has been my first experience with it. If that is the case, and it used to be good, then just know that it has not aged well."
"Not particularly much of a story, fairly annoying anime style.  Luke said it was good, he ♥♥♥♥ing lied.  Game is just okay tbh, I guess my feelings are summed up by the fact that a week after buying it I forgot I even owned it."
"Boooooring. You listen to typical jrpg dialogs for 20 minutes to play mission, that is so easy it becomes boring. This game offers 0 challange."
Can this even be considered a game? It's more of an anime film with limited playability. There is no strategy involved.
"I loved this game up until the cutscene that showcased the team being plotarded to the Nth degree, followed by an obnoxious, uninteresting battle against a giant tank that could've been avoided if, I don't know, the armed trio of people shot the people responsible in the back like they should've."
"As a great fan of the original Valkyria Chronicles, I was looking forward to playing it again. In particular, I was looking forward of using mouse and keyboard so as to mitigate some of the awkward controls of the game on the PS3. But unfortunately, I have to say this is a scam: $20 for an emulation of a 6 years old game is not a fair deal.  I say emulation instead of port because that is how the game feel: The UI is horrendous, the controls are baffling and frustrating and the game does not offer anything really new (in particular, the game does not seem to offer modding support, an appreciated plus for any PC port).  Mapping originial controls to random keys is not a port, it feels bad and the ability to chose which key are linked to which command does not really help either. The game would have needed just a few interface tweaks to make it truly enjoyable on PC. Overall, this feels like just another way of getting money out of fans with no attention given to making the game enjoyable with mouse and keyboard.  The Problems: - Terrible UI - Awkward controls making the main gameplay frustrating - No modding support (as far as I could find, I might be wrong about this) - High price for an emulated 6 years old game - No difficulty controls (to make the game harder for veterans like me or easier for beginners/casual players)  The Good things: - It's Valkyria Chronicles - The game looks as beautiful as ever - The game runs very fast and smooth on my computer (3 year old laptop)"
"Ok, the long range combat leaves much to be disred. One mission you and your tank are in the desert and you have to fight several enemy tanks. To do so you need to fire at long range to soften them up for your lancers, well that would be fine if you could hit anything at ling range with your tank. The enemy on the otherhand don't suffer from this. SO your tank gets beat up to all hell.  It is a ok game but I will not purchase the part two if there is one."
"Maybe I haven't gone the game far enough, but it is just horribly slow; and the forced cheesy dialog makes it worse, I find Valkyria Chronicles to be tedious.   Even the actual gameplay is spent mostly waiting for something to happen, running around in permament bullet time only to get some minor satisfaction popping off a couple of rounds at an enemy target.  I like the premise and artwork of the game, but sadly at the pace that it provides I cannot ever see myself finishing it."
"I'd give this game a 4/10. Honestly it's terrible no clue why every one thinks a console game is the savant of turned based on pc, but let me break it down for you. For a console port it has terrible delay on gamepad controls, the title is like dark souls turned based with just as many bugs. The story is bland at best, but very emotionally charged, you can't skip the enemies turns or cutscenes, and it has no autosave and no real save listing making you guess what save is what (outside of a chapter icon).  Honestly one of the most worthless titles I've played in a long time."
"Horrible Port!! Controls are barely responsive, you know you are in trouble when the main screen asks you to push the start button!"
"Yes, I tried to like this game several times (though it gave me a headeche, Ogami). There is something like 'offline'-playing (when game-time is not registered). After giving it another (short, 30 minutes) go (and yes, I did make it past the tank), I didn't see much reason to completely change my review. So I made some smal changes.  This is, in short, just a childrens game, with an easy to understand story and not to many or to difficult actions. Being an old, frustrated guy, this is really not my cup of tea.   Let's begin with explaining that I bought this game because it had really good critics in the professional press...  Pro's:  - no bugs visible (yet) - recognises a french keyboard  Con's: - almost no gameplay - bad 'anime' animation - story without any feel, inspiration or originality (really, you will have a better time watching boring anime-series for children on tv than watching (not playing) this one - illogical 'strategic' moves (like moving, shooting, being shot at by every enemy and then (and only then) afterwards get the option to duck (sometimes not even then)  Let's explain the feel of the game:  It begins with a story how this war was started (somewhere inspired on WWII, but with not much reasoning and short actions). After six whole chapters with boring storytelling there is 1 'action'-phase. That is, if you would be able to call this an action: You have 3 characters you can control, but in this turn you can only move 1 for max 10 seconds. After that 'movement'-phase, you simply klick on an enemy and the character will do some random shooting. Then all the visible enemies will fire back. After all this you get the option to take cover (HUH???). Normally you should be able to do this 3 times. Sometimes however, the enemy turn simply begins. This means you have to wait for 5 - 10 minutes for ALL the enemies to move and shoot at you. After this long period of actual playing (less than 2 minutes for you), the boring story starts again for several chapters...  The enemies are stupid and therefore easy to kill. The only way to loose is by not getting your second and third move, or by misklicking on the map and having your character going to the wrong place. If that happens you're really ******, because you will have lost (your character has to survive), because there is no undo-button (that is understandable), but also no quit-option: So the only thing left will be making the enemy shoot down your other characters (meaning you have to watch them for 10 minutes until the words 'game over' appair.   If you are looking for a fun animated movie with some gameplay within, go elsewhere. Buy the Wolf amongst us (that one has a lot of fantasy, nice drawing, a lot of different angles in the story, good characterwriting and fun and fast playtimes. The only con there is the impossibility to change the qwerty-keyboard.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS ****"
Why are Empires always depicted as the bad guys in modern fiction?   Also Selvaria dies so I cannot recommend.
"I almost never write reviews, but I felt it necessary to write one for this game seeing as how the current rating is 'Overwhelmingly Positive'.  WHAT!? WHY!?  My main gripes with this game, the reasons I can't tolerate it, are only for a couple reasons.   (Extremely minor spoilers incoming. Really won't be a detriment to your experience at all if you play it, but out of courtesy I'm just letting you all know)  1. The story is embarrassingly bad. It's illogical, poorly written, and the voice acting is attrocious. I remember a scene early on in the game when the Empire (the bad guys) invade your hometown and you have to defend it. After you win the battle, the game says, '2 hours later your hometown was destroyed.' COOL... Loved that I had to play a mission where it doesn't make the player feel like he actually did something... and then in the following cutscene, the main character sadistically holds this newborn baby in his arms, standing atop a hill, while gazing at his ruined, ashen hometown. It's in flames, smoking, destroyed... and he tells the baby, 'look! It's your hometown! :)'  WHAT THE **** BRO!?  2. Player turns are soooo annoying.. I love how the enemy will just shoo at you for eternity when it isn't even their turn. It feels like you're playing a turn-based strategy game against enemies that are playing real-time action game like CoD or something. Hhahaha wtf!? It's so frustrating!   Also... 3. why does the reticle NEVER jump to the enemy you actually want to hit first? There are 3 enemies in front of you, but one is uncovered and right in your face. You want him. You press E, it jumps to the dude 8 kilometers away... uhhh... no. (press Q to switch targets) It picks the tank... CAN I NOT SHOOT THE TANK? THERE'S A GUY STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME, SHOOTING ME NONSTOP, THAT I REALLY NEED TO SHOOT NOW!! (press Q again) FINALLY!! I get to shoot this guy!! He dies.. yay! Time to run away cuz the tank and the dude 8 kilometers away won't stop shooting me and I nee... dead. Sweet  And finally, 4... the game is sooo slow. Is there any way to skip the really lam animations for everything? Sometimes you kill a guy, and the state-of-the-art ragdoll physics leave his death cutscene going for 10 minutes since he got stuck on a rock or whatever. Love it.   You know what.. no more examples.. It's a mediocre game at best.   TL;DR ...Don't get the game. You'll feel bad about throwing away perfectly good money"
It's a crappy version of X-com.
"So, Watching anime is autism tier.  But I thougth, maybe anime games weren't that bad  After 10 mins of playing, I remembered why I ♥♥♥♥ing hate anime and why 2 nukes wasn't enough.  ♥♥♥♥ off japan"
6/10
"Been playing fire emblem so much before and it's mechanics although rather simple and very similar are much better, played my share of x-com games since I was a kid and honestly there's just no comparison X-com beats this game in all possible ways (yes, even the story)... even got other strategy games but this one... meh, the mechanics are nice, the 'look and feel' of the game is right but if can't replay missions that just won't work for me (just a personal opinion), also just by playing this game I'm reminded SO MUCH to Steambot Chronicles that I began thinking to go play that again instead of keep on playing this game, it's not a bad title, it's good but not something I'd recommend personally. And just a smal digression... I regret paying so much for this game... it's just not worth it, maybe 8.99, but 19.99? hell no  ----   Update - Been talking to a friend about this game since he's playing it as well and... I'm not changing my review to recommend this game.  -Transitions when shooting are slow and feel a bit clunky - X com had better  -Chapters are well done and if we happen not to care what happens in a chapter or it's boring we can advance it (honestly I just touched a lot of keys on the keyboard and it did for me)  -Movement is a very well done system with some good covers - X com and front mission dealt better with that system though  -Characters depth and history are well done - A good comparison point is fire emblem in which characters can talk to eachother and they set some sort of rapport with others but this is very limited in F.E  -Grinding, there is grinding and good ways to get it but nothing really interesting, so you get grinding as you go through the story and then replaying you can redo missions, this is a 'meh' point for me honestly there is a game that had something similar Eien no Aseiia (or something like that) damn it's been sometime that I've played that.  All in all I don't recommend this game for two strong points: 1- the price of 20$, for me this is too much, I've paid WAY LESS for x-com games and fire emblem ones, and there are better games for strategy which cost just a bit more 2- the game brings not much originality it's more of 'ok so we have several games that were awesome due to their gameplay and stories, let's start mixing them up with a good story on a WW setting and see if it's good' (again this is what I felt from playing the game SUCH FEW MINUTES because I couldn't stand to play it much more)  Digression: Damn the chapter graphics remind me so much to Steambot Chronicles... wish there was a steambot chronicles 2."
"I've been hoping against hope for years that we see more playstation titles on the PC, so naturally I picked up this title.  Here is the deal. Valkyria Chronicles is a turn based strategy game wtih third person shooter elements. It relates awkwardly to two titles I've played before. The first of these is X-COM Enemy Unknown and the second is Brutal Legend.   Just to start off with this game is no X-COM. If you are looking for X-COM buy X-COM or wait half a decade for a new X-COM. This game is similar in some ways to X-COM given that has a turn based system and uses an over the shoulder view. The fact is though this game is very easy and it goes out its way to annoy you. The AI actively avoids killing you and virtually every combat works off the same broken system. It apes X-COM as much as any game can ape X-COM.  Now to relate it to Brutal Legend. Brutal legend is a flawed gem of a game. The fact is this game has a very simlar failing. The weird 3rd person RTS gameplay of Brutal legend is basically repeated in this game and just like Brutal Legend mistakes were made and the system got too complicated to be properly playested. You can see in both games where the developers, likely short on time and ideas, doubled down on bad ideas and ended up with a mess on their hands that they couldn't sort before they were overcommited.   Pros :  The cell artwork is very pretty The first five hours or so is quite fun before you realize the AI is really not putting up a fight. Many decisions the game designers made were very clever and good. If you are studying game design this would be something to look at.  Cons :  The game actively trolls you. There are these movies that tie the combats together. Put simply, they are mindnumbingly awful and they are far too prevalent. It feels like the writers of this game wanted to make a bad anime. The AI is trash There is no real skill required to win this game just a little bit of a luck. There are major issues with bullets and the terrain. Sometimes a target will be protected by an invisible tree. The research tree does not seem to unlock anything new or different.  Conclusions :   Wait until 2.99$ on Steam Sale, if you have five hours to blow."
"Laziest port I've ever played.  Like many Japanese ports of console games to PC, it's basically just the console game with a menu tacked onto the beginning (this menu is actually a separate exe as far as I can tell). There's no way to access this menu from in-game. This means if you want to change any of the controls (including sensitivity), graphics options, etc, you need to restart the game. To add insult to injury...      Only some of the game text/prompts are changed. 'Press START button' right on the main menu.     No mouse navigation anywhere in the game menus (except for the PC options menu that appears before the game)     The mouse is just used as the analog stick. This is a STRATEGY GAME where instead of clicking on the units you have to use the keyboard to control menus. You can sort of awkwardly move the pointer around using the mouse, but there's a lot of weird acceleration, so it doesn't work anything like an actual mouse. Also it seems to use the same acceleration as the aiming does. Your arm will get tired trying to change targets.     There's an 'options' choice on the main menu that takes you to the console options menu where you can change subtitles/etc. So there's actually 2 options menus... one you need to restart the app for, and another one in-game     Mouse sensitivity is on the PC options menu. And it's not a slider -- it's a single button that increments the value (5-100) by 5, then resets. So if you want to change the sensitivity from 35 to 30, you have to click the button 19 times.     The whole PC options menu is very slipshod; probably done in 3 hours by some overworked, hung-over salary man. Either that or SEGA doesn't believe in any UI elements other than buttons.     HD textures? Antialiasing? Haha yeah right.     Honestly it looks like the game is rendering in 720p and upscaling, considering the weird jaggies along edges.   You'd think for $17.99 they could spend at least a month trying to just barely integrate it into the platform. You'd be wrong. I've seen some lackadaisical ports before, but this even beats out the Grandia 2 PC port.  Is this a good game? Aside from the controls, it seems like it. The setting is cool and I like the idea behind the hybrid strategy combat. But it's hard to get past how this game completely misunderstands te platform that it's on. It feels like a cash grab by SEGA rather than something they spent any time on. They do not deserve $17.99 for this piece of 💩.  Yes, I know I've only spent under an hour with it, and that's all the time I needed to realize how awful this game's PC rendition is."
Makes you wish you were playing Fire Emblem instead.
"This game still suffers from the fatal design flaw the PS3 version suffers from.  As Yahtzee put it 'I hope you like ending your turn as fast as possible'  The Flaw: The AI never stops shooting at you during your turn, ever! In fact I failed a tutorial mission when my main char was shot to death while the game transitioned from overhead to third person control. Thats right, I never had a chance to move the character and it was killed off because the AI started firing before I had control of the char.  As it stands I can not recommend this game with that massive design flaw still in play."
"Well...  First of all, a horrible port. That should almost be expected at this point, but there it is. If you have multiple monitors, be prepaired to set it to windowed mode because it will inevitably select the wrong monitor. Also, it crashes pretty often, and with no autosaves, you'll be doing sections over...and over...and over.  As for the game itself? Great graphics, fantastic art dirrection, different, but good combat. Unfortunately you need to wade through the standard JRPG maudlin crap to get to it. Be prepaired to play for at least an hour and a half before you get to the meat of the game, with a LOT of cutscenes. Thankfully, they are skipable.  Beyond that, I can't say. Hopefully a patch will fix some of the port issues, but for now, I'm tired or retreading the same cutscenes and slogging through all the menus after each crash. Hopefully I'll be able to play more someday because I feel like there might be a decent, if shollow strategy game under there somewhere. Not really an SRPG (no customization, and linear leveling), but a strategy game."
"I don't get what all the hype's about. Too many cutscenes, not enough gameplay, and you can't replay missions. 3/10."
enemy fires at you infinitely right at the start i died at tutorial mission unable to move further when the enemy has pin point accuracy and infinite shooting power makes for a bad experience............
If you can't stand anime ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t avoid like the uncle you hate that comes over your house all the time and you pretend to be asleep whenever he does.
Everything is great about the game except the combat. The controls are so dissatisfying that when you'll lose missions because the program has no idea what you're trying to do. Stick to the console version or wait for a big patch.
"Forgive the crude comparrison but I am lazy. XCOM meets JPRG Fantasy in 3rdperson turnbased tactical. And it's good. Gets very challenging quite quickly. Story is decent, set in an alternative WWII/Fantasy world. I think Gallia is meant to be a fantasy style Netherlands? Anyway, worth playing. Completionists will find this one tough with all the Expert modes and Newgame+ stuff"
"I'll say it right off the bat, I am not a fan of RPGs they bore me, characters are lame an so on. But this game is simply AMAZING. Buy it, play it and SEGA?, hurry up and release Valkyria Chronicles 2&amp;3 on steam please!"
This game is a beautiful timeless gem which is refreshing to play as it was when the game first came out.
"A diamond in the rough, this game takes the best mechanics of classic strategy games and fuses them with (watercolor inspired) anime aesthetics to present a compelling story. A winning formula that needs to be experienced by everyone... even if the clumsy book-styled UI -sometimes- gets in the way.  Also, submachine guns make actual ' Ra-tatata ' texts appear on screen when fired. 10/10 (and, this time, the score is not a joke)."
A hidden gem. One of a kind. One of the best jrpg's on Steam currently.
"BEAUTIFUL! I remember playing this the first week it was launched for the PS3, and was just excited about playing it again on PC as I was back then.  I personally always enjoy Cell Shading type graphics, and this one is extremely artistic (and high quality). Storyline is very solid and has great content. Characters are memorable, and I found myself rooting for them. Play style is tactile and turn-based, however I personally have not encountered another game using the same system. All in all, if you enjoy jrpgs, turn based games, and steampunk.....then this game is definately worth a try."
I enjoyed playing it. I'd recommend it to someone who likes tactics turn based strategy games. 10/10
This game is amazing!!! I'd easily give it a 4.5/5 star review.
"  We were told to hold the border And that is what we did Honoured by our orders In despite of our foe  We! We will resist and bite! Bite hard, cause we are all in sight We! We take up arms and fight! Fight hard, resist and do what’s right!    Sabaton - Resist and Bite"
Amazing game... Buy it! (Badge progression ; )
XCOM only better...
"The port's a little dodgy with alt tab bugs, and if you get over the cheese that the AI is capable of sometimes and a couple of in game balance issues (scout zerg rushes, bipolar difficulty curve) you've got an awesome TBS 3rd person shooter with one of the best stories ever in a video game."
"Absolutely great game! Played the hell out of it on the PS3, and this game does not disappoint! On top of all that, you get all of the extra DLC and the entire package comes at a fraction of the price you'd pay for the console version and all of its goodies. It's a different type of game, it's an RTS/TBS/Third-Person Shooter hybrid, but it flat out works! Highly recommend!"
"A great game with immersive story, an original and well-made gameplay and above all gorgeous art. I don't see what it could miss, honestly."
Lovely game. Had a lot of fun.  *Important stuff: DO NOT INCREASE RESOLUTION
"I don't even know where to begin with this game. I guess I'll start with the story. The way the story is presented to you is pretty cool. It reminds me of 'Left 4 Dead' but instead of movies, there called episodes. The backstory and current story are amazing and captivating, altough a little unoriginal. The setting seems a little bit futuristic, but takes place in 1930's Europe. The characters are all unique and lovable in there own way. I like how they develop during the game. This all helps to set the tone of the game. Now for the combat system. The combat system is a mix of a strategy and third person shooter. I love how the characters plan a strategy before battle that you can either choose to follow or ignore. I love the combat system. The graphics and art style are pretty damn good, and I love the animation it all blends perfectly well together. The voice acting is good and the dialogs are memoriable and quoteable too, which in my opinion is great for a game. The soundtrack fits this game well, which is needed to set the tone for a scenario. Well that about sums this game up, its a MUST HAVE. If I was stuck on an island and had to choose one game to play, I would choose this game. You will find yourself immersed in a wounderful adventure making you want more. Sorry that this review was so long, as you can see I had a lot to say about it. Hoped this helped."
tfw anime is more realistic than cutting edge graphics
The game is wonderful.I advise everyone. There is a  Interesting story Gameplay Graphics Atmosphere And Many Others  My rank 10/10 
Great combat system and engaging storyline. Hours of fun!
"A hidden gem. Brilliant RPG/Strategy game for the PS3 and PC. I really don't understand why the sequel was released for the PSP only when it could have been a huge commercial success on the PS3 or PC. I hope they do eventually make a PC/PS3/PS4 port for it. This is a must-own game for any RPG/JRPG/Strategy fan. The story is amazing, the character depth is on the same level as Chrono Trigger, and the voiced dialogue throughout the entire game helps show how much time they put into this game."
"War is a phenomenon that inspires so many different emotions and creative juices, yet this oversaturation of the market causes for quite a lot of vaporware. Valkyria Chronicles is one of those hidden gems. It is nothing short of a war opera, with accompanying score and anime staples in for good measure. It is a story that will stay with you for quite a while, and the best part is that it is fun to play. The game has a permadeath system a la Fire Emblem, and each soldier under your command has their own personality that affects their combat prowess. These range from an attraction to another member of the squad to being allergic to flowers. It really gives the game depth and makes each soldier feel special. The only part of this game that I could say is not executed very well is the grade system. You get graded not on how well you perform, but rather how quickly you complete a mission. This causes for a lot of the tactical gameplay to take a backseat when it really should be driving the whole experience. All in all 9/10 would play many times over."
"I never heard about this game before it came to steam. I was extremely impressed with the story and gameplay. It can be challenging in some places, but it's a good challenging that will make you think. The campaign took about 37 hours to complete and I was sucked into the story the whole time. The whole story was an emotional roller coaster."
"The Good: A solid game that masterfully combines turn-based strategy and third-person shooter elements into one surprisingly entertaining package.  The Bad: The main campaign itself features lengthy and utterly linear story elements between missions. The problem here is that the characters are often difficult to relate to, and sometimes make plot-critical choices that don't make a lot of sense. (So, we have gained the friendship of an omnipotent godling who can effortlessly blow up tanks and armoured bunkers with their psuedo-magical powers. But the protagonist all-but ORDERS that godling to NOT use their magical god-powers, and instead repeatedly sends them out onto the battlefield with nothing but a standard-issue rifle to defend themselves... Excuse me, but WTF?! )  But, while the early-game is dotted with story scenes that are boring and often seem relatively meaningless, the story DOES pick up towards the end, and there are quite a few cutscenes along the way that will give viewers 'the feels'."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a Hybrid RTS/3rd Person shooter set amongst a WW2-style setting. Gameplay consists of a progression-based story, with optional skirmish/challenge missions which can be used to gather money and experience which can be used to upgrade units and upgrade your weapons and tanks. Combat is turn-based, with each unit having the ability to move and fire, but movement creates real-time attacks of opportunity.    Positives: - Engaging, tactical gameplay. - Customizable playstyle for tanks and classes. Your second tank can be customized to an AT or AP armament. Each one has it's own positives and negatives. - Enjoyable campaign. - about 40 hours to complete main story line. - Art style is superb.   Negatives: - Challenge maps tend to have a specific 'do x then y then z' to win and aren't freeform. A few are very tedious. - camera can fight you at times. Tanks will move according to direction of camera and can result in loss of valuable AP. - movement with sandbags/trenches can be annoying.  Notes: - Units have passive bonuses which appear as they level. These can be a boon or bane. Fortunately, units also have a friend's list, which allows them to have supporting fire when attacking and in range of a friendly unit.  What's it play like? It's XCOM meets Fire Emblem."
"A thoroughly entertaining, visually appealing and charming tactical RPG set in a world whose situation closely resembles the outbreak of World War 2."
"Great characters, good story, gorgeous art-style and a brilliant combat system(perfect fusion between strategy and action).  Loved it on PS3, love it even more on PC; 60fps, 1080p downsampled from 4K via GeDoSaTo(Thanks to Durante).  Sega should remaster VC3(PSP assets are junk) and release that on PC."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a charming little real-time third person shooter/turn-based tactical JRPG hybrid.  Set in a fictional WWII-esque era, the game has a disturbingly cutesy take on the horrors of war. Your homeland of Gallia is invaded by The Empire, and you soon find yourself leading a small band of militiamen intent on pushing them back. Given a set amount of points each turn with which to perform actions, it's up to you to find the perfect blend of scouts, shocktroopers, lancers, engineers and snipers to win the day."
"Same game as the PS3 version + all DLCs. I play it with a generic PS2 controller and USB adapter. The joypad buttons are displayed in the menus as unintuitive grey spots with numbers while the Xbox 360 pad gets its buttons displayed correctly. This is weird, as the game was originally made for PS3, the DualShock buttons exist and therefore should have been available in this PC version. Except this, I haven't noticed any issue. Although the original game was released in 2008, it remains fresh both in terms of gameplay and graphics. A game I recommend without hesitation."
"one of my fav ps3 games, now they port it to PC with high res. definitely recommend this to all anime and TRPG fans"
Simply amazing. No excuse to not play this gem of a game.
"Valkyria Chronicles was my favorite game on PS3. I was always sad they never released achievements but i completed the game several times over anyway. When I heard it was coming to PC I was overjoyed. Valkyria chronicles is a tactical, turn based strategy game with a anime-esque art style and is extremely fun.   The game can be played many ways (and I have yet to play it on the harder difficulties, looking forward to that) and offers some interesting strategic decisions. Do you let your scouts outpace your heavy infantry and try to pick off the enemy at range? Do you spend some valuable command points to bring your tank forward to smash through a heavy concentration of infantry? Do you sit back and let your snipers pick off the enemy one-by-one while your engineers keep them supplied with ammo? There are many ways to play this game and make it fun; and if all else fails you can always play it slow and safe to finish a hard mission. Another dimension of depth is added by Potentials (unique traits that have a chance to activate during combat) that each character has as well as what other characters they like, which grants them other bonuses when they are together.   However, perhaps the best part of the game is its story. Each of the main characters has a beautifully crafted personality and you really get to know them throughout the game. Some people skip dialogue when they play games. If you do this in Valkyria Chronicles, you will miss so much that this game has to offer. As the story goes on, you fall in love with the characters. They will make you laugh, and sometimes even cry.   As someone who has played everything from Fire Emblem to XCom to Starcraft, I would DEFINITELY recommend this game. It will always hold a special place in my heart for its gameplay and its story that tugs at emotions. 20/10 would buy twice."
"Ignore the play time as i have played this before on PS3 back when it first came out (but since sold) I was so happy to see this on steam because now i can play it again :D This game is well worth the money, Hell ive bought it twice now (and neither time on sale)"
Best Turn Based RTS Third Person Shooter JRPG
"This is a fun game in the vein of X-Com or Fire Emblem, but with an anime take on a world war like scenario. It touches on a lot of themes you don't often see in strategy or war games, has a decent soundtrack, and the characters are likeable enough. I really don't like the slow menus and constant dialogue from everyone you meet at headquarters though. Makes doing trivial tasks take forever. The missions are fun and the strategy involved will leave you wanting to hop into the next mission as soon as you can."
"Dont miss my PS3 any more.  10,000/10"
One of the best JRPGs/tactics games you can find on Steam right now.
"Awesome game! Glad it finally came out on PC, just as good as I remember."
I would heavily reccomend this game to any fans of the Fire Emblem series. A very clean port from the ps3.
"Excellent game. The art style is great, voice acting is great and the gameplay is really fun. The port is great also.  Definitely a great buy!  Thank you SEGA for bring this to the PC. The rest of the series would be good, oh, and Yakuza. Thanks."
I love this game and the port is a faithful one. I hope they do the rest of the series.
"Very charming little gem, no regrets giving it a go on Steam sale. Typical J-RPG script, can't say that I care much for that, but the squad you frequently take into battle does grow on you and the cutscenes in between skirmishes in the field add a nice interlude to the action (where I could vape and just sit back watch). An interesting and very worthwhile take on turn based strategy. Definitely get it if you're a fan of the genre"
"Loved the story! I really got invested in the character development. The combat is incredibly hard at times, as I'm inexperienced in turn-based strategy games, but lovers of such combat systems will probably have no problem finding optimal strategies for claiming victory in some of the later missions.  This game is definitely worth a buy."
"Even tho its animeish and has a super nuke lance/shield weilders, The game itself is great and fantastic, I enjoyed every moment of it. The story well done to point where it got me in climax of it. Great game for people who are into TBS with a good story.   THere are a few bugs n crashes but it really marginal to point where doesn't matter."
A really fresh mix of classic turn-based gameplay and modern line-of-sight tactical mechanics. Manages to be challenging while still having a variety of ways to tackle any given obstacle. Keeps the best of the classic experience/character level system while doing away with the parts that prevent you from switching characters later in the game.   On the down side it's graphically underwhelming with cringey JRPG tropes to spare. Also as a console port the menu interface is somewhat unintuitive.   But I like my tactical RPGs tactical and this one delivers. Recommended to fans of the genre.
"Definitely worth your time. You get a decent story telling, a bit different on detail than the anime but same direction. I like the combat system also, turn base and action at same time. There are some way to win a battle faster than expect if you know how to do it right and get A rank.   There are upgrades for weapons and tank, after some ranks there will be new look for the weapons or tanks. You can pick chars up to 20 from a longer list to your team and pick you who want to use on the battle, they are lv base on class so you don't have to lv them up individualy, just rank up the class and they all be strong with different skills unlock."
Jus like x-com but with less aliens and more cute girls and tanks.  10/10
this game is awesome fun! great mix of real time and strat. love it
Great game! Strategy and RPG combined perfectly. I watched the anime back in years ago and didn't like it back then. But the actual game (which is the anime based on) is a lot better! Hopefully they can bring the 2nd and the 3rd one of the series on PC platform soon.
"The story telling of this game is just fantastic, all events/cutscenes you can view again in the story mode. As for the battle mode, it's kind of challenging to use the available command points to move around. Strategic planning is really critical in this game, as you need where to position your units and intercept your enemy moves next.  The downside of this game is the ranking requirments to complete the mission. All missions has a requirement to complete in how many turns to get a rank from A to D. A rank means more XP and cash. As for my playstyle, I prefer to take my time and eliminate my enemies one by one (useless it is a time based mission, fine). There is no autosave feature, therefore it is important to save often. Moreover, I have found out that the Edy's Professional Challenges doesn't come with English voice (useless you prefer and like Japanese voice, ok that's fine).  Overall, this is must try tactical-role playing game.  9 / 10"
"Hours of fun, a great game.  Pros:  - Great storyline  - Excellent gameplay  - Fun and chellenging missions  - Nice visuals  Cons:  - Controlling the tank well is tricky, takes some practice, could have made controls for it better  - Some of the menus could be done better, eg. not visually obvious you can scroll down to more options"
"Just a fantastic game all around. Good WWII-like setting and story, great tactical battles and plenty of characters to mix and match to make a good squad. Also, it looks amazing and sounds wonderful. Couldn't ask for more."
"I really enjoy playing this game (I played it a lot more on DS than Steam), however it seems Steam really blows at managing the saves for this, and after 2 hours of solid gameplay I find myself without a save file despite saving after every single cutscene, as well as before, during and after every battle. So I really can't bring myself to play it on Steam again when I can't trust that I'll be able to resume where I saved.  For the record, I have no idea if this is Valkyria Chronicles' or Steam's fault. So I'm gonna recommend it anyway and assume that I'm like the only person this has happened to. Really a fun game if you're into this genre; well worth the money."
"Quickly becoming one of my favorite games of all time, and oddly enough it was made by SEGA, who in the past, have had a few hit and misses... with more misses than hits.  Valkyria Chronicles takes place in a fictional Europe (named Europa) during a fictional WW2. Instead of the Nazis being the deadliest threat on earth, you essentially have a fictional version of Russia attacking (named the Empire) attacking. The setting is in a small neutral border country named Gallia, and before you know it, you're thrown in the war to protect your home land.  Units each have backstory, voice acted, and some and more loveable than others. They each have their own strengths (and weaknesses) and can determine how they play out in battle. Some are out to impress the ladies while others are kinda racist to their own fellow soldiers. Either way, its up to you as Squad Leader to see them through the day.  All throughout this game I never got bored and always kept thinking of new strategies and how I would win, even after I left the computer. Speaking of which the port is pretty darn good with the only complaint being the starting settings (but you can fix it by right clicking the game on your steam game's list).  The only complaint I have with this game is that the preview map you're given before each mission isn't exactly the most helpful, and you may find yourself restarting each level a number of times because of some unforeseeable events in the mission briefings.  Other than that, this game is wonderful."
"10/10 Game  Anime X-Com, complete with Fanservice episode, and Skies of Arcadia easter eggs. Although while the developers state their inspiration was WW2, it leaves a feeling of WW1 with me, from the uniforms to the tanks to even how the rifles and machine guns look.  Would love to see optimized and HD versions of 2 and 3 (Hey, if they made AC: Liberation into a PC game, they could with VC2)"
"I have played this game once on the PS3 for over 60 hours in 2008. I replayed this game this year for another 60 hours.  You will definitely get your moneys worth for this title, otherwise buy it for the nostalgia, better graphics and faster loading times than the PS3."
Good game and fun to play :3
"There is a reason why this game has outsold AC Unity on steam: Magnificent presentation, top notch gameplay, and a suprisingly competent story make this a must buy for any fan of turn based strategy or Jrpgs!"
"Great game, at first I was a little put off by it being turn based, but still fun."
"If you like a good story with fun, varying gameplay, buy this game"
"This game is beyond excellent. Having owned the original ps3 version, all the dlc. and various bits of merchandise, it's fair to say that this game holds a special place in my heart."
Highly recomend. A lot of story and cut scenes so more like a book with outstanding combat. The combat is a mix between the over view were you sselect the unit you use and can see the class health and class of all your and the seen enemy units and the part where you walk them around and shoot /use items.
"This is one of the greatest games I've ever played. The cutscenes are certainly not monotonous or have too much packed into them, as IGN says. They are a welcome addition that I looked forward to, as I cared about the story and the characters, especially since anyone could die at any moment, even in gameplay, your character dies, they die forever. Excellent story and gameplay, some levels can be difficult at first, but some that seemed impossible, I finished on the second turn, instead of the alotted 20 turns, see Princess Cordelias mission. Buy it, naow."
"Really good game. If you like turn based games, or games similar to like Fire Emblem, then this is highly roccomended. It's a 3rd person shooter Fire Emblem."
"This game is just awesome! The combat system is unique (at least in my experience) but very satisfying while maintaining a decent level of challenge, and the voice acting and visuals are both great. I haven't experienced any issues regarding the game being a port except for some minor framerate issues in areas with a lot of tall grass. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes tactical RPGs."
There are plenty of good reviews for this game.   All I really need to do is add my thumbs up and encourage players to give it a try.  It rocks.
"Pros:  - Good tactical turn-based shooter, with some RPG elements. - Great artwork and manga-style cutscenes.  Cons:  - Game rewards speed of completing missions rather than good tactics. - Annoying tank controls. - Characters are rather two-dimensional and voice acting is only mediocre."
"This game is basically Japan's take on the Xcom formula set in a the 'Second Europan War', reminiscent of WW2. After finishing it, I can see why it was called one of the best PS3 exclusives.  Pros: -very unforgiving, missions can spiral out of control in a few good moves for the enemy -a lot of freedom, units not being bound to a square grid or hexes -fantastic presentation and story -unforgetable, unique art style -1080p, 60FPS with support for 4K via a launcher -surprisingly good KB+M support  Cons: -certain cutscenes are 720p movies files instead of inengine -easy to abuse saving and loading during missions, since you can redo risky shots that have a very low chance to hit as much as you want and steamroll some missions -the rating system promotes rushing past enemies with scouts and capturing objective markers and not combat to a high score (For maximum enjoyment, I really recommend not abusing the save or scout rushing on your first playtrhough) "
"Do you like RPGS or JRPGS? If you answered yes, buy this game immeadiately. It's beyond worth the price. The game plays a lot like things Fire Emblem and Xcom, except with an anime flair. I'll admit to crying at several points during this games story, and if you are into a challenge then this game has that as well. Or at least for me it did, maybe I suck at it who knows. I recommend this game if you like strategy rpgs. But even if you're just curious or love a good story you will definitely enjoy this game."
There shouldn't be any reason why this game isn't in your game library yet.
"One of the greatest games i have ever played on the PS3.  Controlling the action with keyboard and mouse is a bit clunky, but well worth the effort to play this game again."
"An exceptional combination of Tactics, Turnbased Action and FPS. Hard but only if you don't think about your moves."
"Fans of Skies of Arcadia may be interested to know that a lot of the team that worked on that game were also involved with the Valkyria Chronicles project in one way or another, and I am pleased to say that this shines through in the finished product. The art style is simply captivating, the music beautiful and complimentary and the story is deep and inviting.   The gameplay is turn-based combat a la Fire Emblem, Banner Saga, etc. But instead of each individual character getting one go per turn, your units have a shared pool of 'command points' which you spend to make them move. This means you can get each unit to move once per turn, or one unit to move multiple times, or whatever you like. In addition, your party levels up as a group rather than individually. This helps make battles more tactical and prevents you from being able to make one character super buffed and relying on them to win all your battles for you.   All in all, I'd say this is one of the more pleasant gaming experiences I've had this year. Yes, there are a few bugs here and there. Yes, the tank movement system leaves something to be desired. But the overall feel and performance of the game are top notch. And for fans of Skies of Arcadia, if you're looking for a spiritual successor, this is as close as you could hope to get."
Omg...I havent played it for to long but I love it!
"JRPG/XCOM/Fire Emblem love child.  One of my favorite games on the PS3, happy to be able to play it on PC. An overall great port with minor issues like a crash bug the first time you get to the HQ and go into book mode while fullscreen (which you can fix by temporarily playing in windowed mode), and lack of mouse control for the menus.  Not for those who are too lazy to scroll through texts, or skip out on tutorials. Best played with a controller."
"This game is simply amazing. I have no better way to put it than amazing. The orchestral score, the beautiful cutscenes made in a hand-drawn manner telling the entire story of the game, the complexity that is acheived with only 6 unit types on the field at any given time. This game is amazing.  The graphics are beautifully drawn in a style that suggests it's being painted as you're watching it. The game runs for the most part at a smooth, solid 1080p with the frame rate easily reaching 60 and staying there. That's fairly impressive, considering the game came out 6 years ago for Playstation 3. My only gripe about this is that the cutscenes are supposedly in 720p as opposed the the strategy bits being in 1080p, though I can't tell the difference due to the art style. If that's a thing that bothers you, keep that in mind.  As I said earlier, this game originally came out for PS3 exclusively. You would think that this would make the menus and game play impossible with out a controller, right? WRONG. The menus are only a little tricky at first due to the lack of cursor, but after getting used to navigating with WASD or arrow keys, it works just fine. Not to mention the fact that the main attack is aimed with a reticule, meaning mice are perfect here.  Really, there is nothing wrong with this game and it does many things right. It is definitely worth the $20 purchase if you can stomach anime and enjoy tactical RPGs.  Final Verdict: 10/10, Candidate for 2014 Game of the Year."
"I am only a few hours into this game but I can tell you I am enjoying it very much. The story is excellent so far. I love the use of squad tactics. The love the hand drawn look of the graphics. You can use a keyboard and mouse but I would use a controller if you have one. My xbox controller works perfect. I'll be honest. I wasn't sure about this game but took a chance anyway. I'm glad I did. If you like the genre or are just looking for a change of pace, this is a good game."
I love this game ... the battles don't run to long ... and the campaign is massive! Bought it for $20 and I highly recommend it to all my friends that like RPGs/Strategy games. The only thing that stunk about it is that it is a JRPG ... so expect that wierd JRPG stuff to happen in this game like it does in other games.
"Just brilliant. As expected from a remake of the ps3 version, and a game of the anime series."
"This game is so good! AHHHHHHHH. I can't believe I waited so long to pick it up. The art and gameplay and characters are all so...beautiful and great and amazing. If you're a fan of great video games, definitely pick this up."
Easily one of the best stratedgy games ive played in a long time
I played a mission for over an hour before a rocket guy I couldn't see 1 shot my tank. 10/10
Very cut scene heavy but the gameplay is enjoyable
I love this ♥♥♥♥ing game
"Bender from Futurama plays a camp gay missle man who has the hots for your tank dudes, your other dudes, all your dudes  Your lead sergeant is a baker and probably makes hot biscuits 10/10"
"A very good port to pc, the game takes strategy to a different level from most games i have played. The story plays out in a similar way as a comic, while the game itself is some what similar. the art for the game is great very well done. the game play itself i thought it was excellent, similar to other strategy games as each unit has thier own abilitys. but each character has thier own potentials which can affect the unit in both positive or negative ways which to me is a unique. I highly recommend this game to those whom like strategy games and are looking for a new style of game play!"
One of my all time favourite title!
It's about fighting a war with cute anime girls and clueless beta who likes bugs. There's also a flying pig thing because Japan
"Good game a good story is at times a very difficult game.The story changed a bit, not as in the anime set Japanese voice acting and Russian text at the same time teach Japanese  いい話グッドゲーム時間は非常に難しいゲームである物語は少しも変わって、しないアニメのように. セット日本の声の演技とロシア語のテキスト同時に日本語を教える "
pretty good i would very much travel back in time and tell myself to buy it before the sale because it is that good
"This Port of the popular Action RPG is quite fun to play. The Action RPG is well executed but feels clunky at times. The Game itself has an Anime Style to it and is hence done in Cell Shading.  I have some issues with the controls as they rely to much on the keyboard, but they are still nice and fast.  What bugged me the most is the rediculous spoiling Entry Cinematic you watch. As someone who knows the Story from the Anime already i wasnt spoiled a whole lot, but for everyone else that just sucks. And another thing thats really annoying is the fact that the Cinematics suffer from missing Anti-Aliasing which seems due to the fact that its an upscaled 720p movie and no ingame Render.  I made a short look at my youtube channel:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUAelBceN-A "
"After installing this game, I've spent 4 hours hooked up and exploring it. It has great graphics style, nice story and interesting mechanics. Defenetly worth the money."
"A heartwarming cast, an excellent story, and memorable gameplay all come together in this one lovely package to create a truly memorable experience. If you enjoy strategy RPG games, this is something that you should at least play once."
Its as good as I remember it being on the PS3 and this time it actually has achievements. Still holding out hope for bringing the other two games over despite them being PSP. 
"Strangely addictive, despite the utterly cringeworthy animeness of everything. We are mighty military field officers! OH MY GOD A CUTE LITTLE PIGGY WITH WINGS LEMME KEEP IT!!!"
god bless sega for porting this game to pc. I WOULD HAVE NEVER KNOWN ABOUT THIS GAME'S EXISTENCE OTHERWISE. GOD BLESS U SEGA.
"I've had a Valkyia Chronicle's avatar for years. That is how much I liked the game. So when I saw the game pop up for Steam's winter sale, and not knowing it was ported, I just knew I had to grab it.  Even though I have not really played much of the port yet, I would very much recommend this to any one."
"Love this game, great storyline."
"Gameplay that will challenge you, Story that will change you.  11/10"
"Great game, great storyline and it reminds me a lot like X-Com but a lot more simpler. It's like watching an anime for the most part and if you like anime, you'll enjoy this!"
Great game. Not what I expected it to be going in. If you like good story and strategy this is definately a game worth trying.
"Played it for 20 minutes. Already love it. It's like Fire Emblem and XCOM had a baby, but with random fire in between."
"BEETLETASTIC!  A good game with a strong story and a unique tactical gameplay.  If you're not a big fan of the anime look, you should still give the game a chance. It really picks up early into the story and you meet some very unqiue characters to take into battle.  The PC port actually works great. You don't need a controller but I find it more helpful than keyboard and mouse."
"Valkyria Chronicles, started off as a PS3 game, which instantly gained acclaim from especially the Japanese part of the world. It was praised for all kinds of things, from art to story. Two sequels were released on PSP, the quality Valkyria Chronicles 2 and awesome Valkyria Chronicles 3, which unfortunatly, never was released past Japan in spite of near-universal acclaim. Now we witness the Valkyria Chronicles 1, ported into PC and launched into Steam, with amazing success.  Sega has capitalized upon the jRPGs, quickly gaining ground on Steam and raising demand of PC gamers for Japanese products and launched an exemplary port of an excellent game. You have now 2 options. Go with those words and purchase Valkyria now, or read on to the point when you will have no choice whatsoever, but to buy it.  Want to go on?  So be it, then.  Situation is as follows: We follow Welkin Gunther, the nature-loving son of a war hero and Alicia Melichott, a baker girl. They are citizens of Galia, a small but resource-wealthy country. It has to cope with conflict of two superpowers: Atlantic Federation, the union of western democracies and East European Imperial Alliance, a game's 'bad guy'. Aside from combatting Atlantic in vicious war, they invade Galia for sake of abdutant ragnite ore; the resource paramount for maintaining industry and waging modern war. The idillical life of Welkin and Alicia is taken away from them, as they are drafted into militia, to fend off the invasion.  Together, they will fight whoever will threaten Galia with all they have on hand, in the system of tactical turn-based combat, which vaugely resembles XCOM one.  The currency there, are command points, that are used to allow units to execute turns. You can have your unit execute single turn as much times as you want, at cost of a command point. But with each extra move in single turn, it will have decreased amount of movement points.   You start in the map mode, where you see the area you fight in, like you would see in WWII maps. It gives position of your units and enemies you see. When you click on your unit, you go into third person view behind them and control their movement. You can move them around the area, position them anywhere until their action points bar drains off.  With one button, you aim with them manually and fire. With what kind of weapon do you dish out, is usually dependant from the class of the soldiers. There are five primary classes: Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer, Engineer and Sniper. Scouts are mid-range units with great mobility, who are vulnerable and dont put up much of a fight, unless they get to give a headshot with the rifles. Shocktroopers are your frontline close-quater fighters, who mow down the enemy with sub-machine guns. Lancers are resilient anti-tank warriors, wielding “lances”, which are in fact less practical versions of RPGs. Engineers repair destructible items like sandbags, disarm mines, resupply people and repair tanks. Snipers are painfully slow, but long-range hunters. All they need is one headshot, to kill an exposed footman. And there are also alot of other machines of war.   Tanks are very often your opponents, but you have a tank yourself. Named Edelweiss, the tank can put up a fight to any enemy light tank and with engineer around, it can resist alot more. Tank repairs are overpowered, see. And there are of course, the Valkyrur. An ancient race of warrior females, they wield crazy-♥♥♥ powers and crazy-♥♥♥ lances, that shoot bolts of blue energy that decimate anything at any range. You don't get to see them often.  You need to use terrain to your advantage. You can hide your troops from enemy fire behind all kinds of walls, have them crawl in high grass and behind sandbags, which provide defense bonuses, no matter where the fire is coming from. I hate this, personally. There really should be flanking bonuses for the attacker, but all my unit gets is an attack power drop. God, this got me so angry.   The AI is also sometimes failing, with alot of advantages to push my squad to the breaking point, but not using the opportunities it gets. It is probably scripted into not moving one unit more than twice. Anyway, the AI's lack of determination, often supports player's bold plans and concentrated assaults. But the good stuff makes up for all the flaws.  I like music in this game. It's a set of scores made with classical instruments, that are very often beautiful, calming when needed, then fast-paced when appopiate. It posseses lots of traits of other jRPG music. There are some scores that are plain STELLAR and are FAR less known than they should be.  All units are unique people with unique personalities. That includes set of people they like and bunch of potentials, which provide bonuses/penalties under certain circumstances. Welkin loves nature, so he fights better in meadows. While representatives of Darscen race, get bonuses when fighting close to each other. You might get attached to your men and women well, since they all have a backstory. Seeing your favorite trooper die can be quite sad, even if each class levels up equally. However, the people who reach 0 health points, do not die. Instead, they are knocked out and you have 3 turns to reach them and call in a medic, before they die. Quite alot, specially with a spare scout. But this is an XCOM veteran speaking, who has bitten his teeth on the Long War mod, so if you find this rhetoric too gritty, you should go buy the game and judge for yourself.  After a battle, you have to go to training barracks and spend experience to level up classes. Classes, not individual troops, which makes your squad far less brittle. You also spend DCT points, which are used to purchase new toys from Research and Development. New attachements for Edelweiss, better armor, better rifles, everything can be upgraded. You also get to learn orders, while spending experience or visiting an old veteran in cementary. Orders are special stat boosters, that cost command points. Use them when you need a boost for someone who has to make a bold move.  Cutscenes are everywhere. As you’d expect from a jRPG, at least 40% of the gameplay, are cutscenes. Those alone take 13 GB of hard disk space. At least it’s not 30GB, like certain jRPG. The plot is certainly coming quite close to the truth about WWII concentration camps, closer than most WWII games, while working in world of fiction! Things like genocides, racism, causes of racism, cynical scheming and so many grunts simply wanting to return home to their families, none of those are evaded by Valkyria. Its plot can compete in terms of maturity with titles like Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings (and other Witcher franchise games), even in spite of not having what Witcher has (debauchery and 18+ ♥♥♥♥) Most of that plot occurs in those cutscenes, which are all neatly made.  Because though the plot, soundtrack and art are great, Sega had to add one more great advantage. It is the quality of the PC port, which is plain stellar. Valkyria: Chronicles is exemplary in terms of stability and technical side of the game and every port should be like this one (I’m looking at you, Assassin’s Creed Unity!) The game supports dozens of resolutions ( 7580x5320? Sure! ). Its impossible to get it crashed, as far as I know. The aestethics, as well as the fact that the game will easily run even on a toaster, are reasons enough to forgive lack of 2014 graphics. Try it yourself, test it on laptop with 1.7 GHZ I-5 3317U, along with integrated graphics card. It will run on 44 FPS!  And so, I have described before you this beautiful experience, called Valkyria Chronicles. You can complain about cliche anime features, or lack of autosave, but you can not deny it its originality and beauty.   Feel free to send Square Enix my regards, along with copy of this game, described: 'How does a proper PC port look like' Do the same with Ubisoft, while youre at it."
A great game with a great story.
The game is fun and the story line is great. It keeps me enthralled and will be playing this game for a long while.

"At last! This game was first on PS3, then there are 2 sequels on PSP, it's great already that the first from that series is on Steam, I'm looking forward to see the other 2 coming on Steam too. Awesome action turn based strategic game! The game series itself is unique and amazing! I totally love the story and characters!  So stop wasting time and just get this game!"
Played it first on the PS3 (the main reason I bought the PS3). Never got enough of it. Now with the PC version I got the DLCs and all the goodness of the PS3 version.
"Epic strategy-rpg game , nice story  10/10"
"It's Fire Emblem meets World War I - and it's perfect.  Pros -  - Great visuals and art style (It's like playing through an anime.)  - Likeable cast of characters (and great voice-acting).  - Good plot.  - You can go through the cinematics/cut-scenes at your own pace.  - Great gameplay (more on that in a bit.)  Cons -  - I found some of the music got repetitive after a while.  - Advancing the levels of your soldiers can become a little bit of a grind-fest if you don't score well enough during the main missions. (It's always better to finish a level faster than to wipe out every enemy unit on the map, unless they happen to be an elite unit.)  - The mission briefing screen doesn't provide nearly enough information about the battlefield to know whether you've picked the right team for the mission.  Gameplay: Valkyria Chronicles is a turn-based strategy game, but instead of moving units on a grid from above like in Fire Emblem, each round is done through directly controlling your soldiers in 3rd person. In each round, your soldier can move a set distance and perform one action, and each round consumes one Action Point. And you're not usually given enough action points to move all of your units during the turn. You are constantly juggling your use of actions points throughout the battle and figuring which units to move, and how to position so that they avoid as much enemy fire as possible. Fortunately, unlike Fire Emblem, you don't need to worry about levelling up individual soldiers too much. Rather, each soldier has a set of personal 'potentials' or traits, which determine how they fight in battle which affect them both positively and negatively.   One soldier is racist, so he fights worse when standing near 'Darcsens', but he's great at countering snipers. I usually send him off on a lone hill to have sniper duels across the map. Another is a 'metalhead' and gets a kick out of being around tanks, but if you leave him on his own, his 'loneliness' will kick him and make him even more susceptible to enemy attacks. And as the story progresses, some of these traits change as the characters evolve.  It's not about levelling up individual characters, but putting together the right cast of characters for a particular mission."
"Excellent and replay-worthy game, combining the best elements of many genres to create a hybrid FPS + tactical strategy game. Creative and unique graphics, looking as if they were drawn with colored pencils. Requires clever use of tanks + 5 classes of troops and use of terrain for cover and stealth to gain victory. Highly recommended."
"This is one of the best games I've ever played. There's virtually not a thing wrong with it and all the things are well done. The graphics are cute, the story is touching, it's very long and the gameplay is fun. I also enjoyed the allegory to the second world war throughout the game.  I've even noticed how the music is great and I don't usually care about that. I've memorized the lyrics from the song in this game and listen to it even now."
"Enjoyable and looks pretty, what else do you want?"
"Very glad that the decision was made to port this game to PC, especially considering that the platform of origin was the PS3. I can only hope that Sega will decide to port 2 and 3 in the future."
"3/5 i recommend this game if you liked the anime or if you like TBS games but this game could have some improvements. the game is filled with cutscenes that you have to activate one by one so you cant just sit back and watch them. there's a lot of story in this game, so much that there's a journalist you can actually buy more storys from.(buy with ingame currency. there's no microtransactions calm down :P) the difficulty curve is very unbalanced. i suspect this is because of the focus on story than on gameplay. the game is quite fun however and very satisfying when you win a battle. it's quite visually beautiful and runs amazingly even for a port. i do recommend this game, i had quite a lot of fun with it. oh and another small gripe i had was there's a war cemetery you can go to but you cant actually see who's died which kind of ruins the point of it."
"I have this game on PS3 and absolutely loved when I used to play it. Now it's on Steam and I've been reliving the glory days of one of my all time faves.  Story is fantastic with some nice plot twists Characters are very detailed and loveable  Graphics are amazing (especially if you love anime) Gameplay is very unique and interesting it combines Turn-Based strategy, Real time 3rd person shooter action, and RPG elements   Overall this is definitely one of the best games I ever played  10/10"
"Great game, terrible story."
"If you love 'MATURE', ;COOL', 'CYNICAL', 'DEPRESSING', 'ACT LIKE ♥♥♥' game, this is not the game for you. If you like game with plenty of swearing, this is not the game for you. If you hate anime with a passion because of 'REASONS', this is not the game for you. If you like dark tone, gloomy atmosphere, this is not the game for you. If you are a person who love headshot all day long, this is not the game for you. If you like 'REALISM' this is not the game for you. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!  Still with me? Really? ok........  I actually never ever played Valkyria Chronicles till the day I bought it on Steam.I watch a game trailer about this game a long long time ago, I was initally rebuffed by its anime look, MEH, just another cheap anime visual novel game that will only stay in Japan for good. Then I got Valkyria Chronicles 2 with Warhammer 40k Squad Command along with a few games as a sale bundle on my psp. I am a big fan of Warhammer, but Squad Command is...... not appealing enough compared to VC2, its good positive yet realistic reflection story got me interested in the series. Thus I was probably sure that Valkyria Chronicles, being well reviewed recieve positive reception, was indeed a good game, despite being a Japanese game. During the day of reckoning, this game was released without discount, but nontheless it was affordable so I got it. Wow, this is the game that Valkyria Chronicles build upon.   You play as Gallian citizens turned militia, Welkin (a handsome, well manner nerd with an obsession with nature), Alicia (a pretty baker who dress like she is going for a cosplay), Selvaria ( a sexy Valkyria Warrior armed with giant lance with huge  bo......WHAT?!?  SHE IS ONLY PLAYABLE IN THE SIDE STORY? She is an Imps? Awww......) The game is potrayed in a World War II fashion with a brighter anime tone to it, is a fantasy game so don't expect it to be a game about terrible war and conflict, all out war crime damnation. Nope, the Imperials do murder fleeing citizens, but not in the way how Company of Heroes 2 potrayed(KILLING YOUR OWN PEOPLE, SO 'REALISTIC'!). The story can be summarized as followed, the Empire invade the small Kingdom of Gallia, and the good Gallian citizens draft into the militia to combat the big bad empire. Oh yeah, the official Gallian army are incompetant and act like total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, so its up to your hastily assembled Squad 7 to combat against the Imperial that outnumber you, have better weapons, in good position with a goddess like Valkyria that can one shot anything she touches(spoilers, she show up much later in the story).   Before I talk into the game, I will like to tell you my first impression on the graphics. Is good, better than I initially thought it would be, of course I run this game on my 4 year old laptop and surprisingly, it did a fine job making the game beautiful to look at. Its watercolor pallette style art surprise me in a pleasant way. As a person who play a lot of games with realism or dark brown tone as the core in their presentation, Valkyria Chronicles' bright watercolor tone was a nice change. The game also run smoothly the highest resolution my laptop could handle, and most importantly, it fits well with the games element of design. Some game like Red Alert 3, has graphic that is gorgeous but with units that look completely out of place......  If there is one thing great about this game, is the tank and infantry design og the game. While the game atmosphere is bright, the game units were designed with a lot of care. Tanks look like they are a real threat, infantry armed with guns react like a infantry and the battleground they fought on certainly look great. The games' watercolor shade helps the game fantasy look. While you certianly can waste units and let them die in battle, those units with you certianly got in preferences will at least give you the instinct to preserve them and keep them till the very ends. While charscter design sometimes could be cute and even distracting, it work it work on this game, cause tanks look like tanks, infantry look like infantry and Valkyrur look like a dangerous knightness with lance and shield. Why I would said as such, simple Red Alert 3, tanks look like toys, Conscript look like drunken ruskies, Mig Fighter look like fire cracker with all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t sterotype over the top design basically killed off what I really hope for Red Alert series, Allies units however have units look prim and proper, AMERICA, ♥♥♥♥ YEAH! WE GONNA SCREW RUSSIAN OVER AND OVER AGAIN! AMERICA, ♥♥♥♥ YEAH! So overused that bored me to tears!  Audio is another thing great about this game, while it certianly did not possess the ochestra epicness of many AAA titles, the game's audio is upbeat, fresh and kinda positive, and somethimes shows a threat should be seriously delth with. Audio is a very important element in a video games, but many game I played really did not emphasis in that. This game, while did not featured the most impressive music, certainly featured a fitting one. The voice acting of this game is mixed, while the some English voicework are superb, some, even in Japanese Audio, are really really out of place, Largo and Rosie voice act is this game gems, while the main characters: Alicia and Welkin can be arkward at times. Though you may feel weird at some moments, the game voice over are superior than many major AAA titles voice acting who use superstar voicework but sound like complete crap. Kudos to Valkyria Chronicle on this.  The gameplay: Well to be fair, the game actually released before XCom Enemy Unknown so suffice to say it is a very good turn based strategy/Third Person Shooter/Role Playing game, like the good old XCom. And unlike a lot of TBS games, you choose a unit from top down view and interact directly as the character, you can move him/her around in Third Person View, go to cover, shoot and move around until the energy rans out or you ending your turn. My advice for this game, save a lot, although an anime game, it can be very unforgiving at times. Like Xcom, mistakes will see your soldier dying very quickly at an alarming rate, and you usually have to fight opponenets with numerical superiority and probably have armor support, anyone except important character will suffer permanent death if he/she is captured by enemy or after 3 turns. While the longer the game, the lower the rank you get, I don't really mind, as ranks only affect experience gain, something you can get in Skirmish mode. Play, set up proper defense and offense carefully and see you cut through Imps like grass while feeling your squad are badass muahahahahahaha!  Overall, i like this game. And if you can overlook the anime style, there is a good game here. Want my NONSENSE JUSTIFICATION, its campaign plays better than COMPANY OF HEROES 2, have a story 1 billion times better than the entire TWILIGHT franchise combine, have artstyle equal to TEAM FOTRESS 2(very good), and the game is more stable than TOTAL WAR SHOGUN 2! This basically XCOM but less gritty, but equal amount of FUN!"
Unique and compelling strategy game which i can easily recommend.
"Abit slow paced, and strangely locked at 30fps but an otherwise decent port for a sound tactical rpg.  Do you like WW2? Do you like anime? Would you be keen on guiding your own squad of eager war-hungry band of young adults into gunfire? Then Valkyrie Chronicles will be right up your alley.  You're given Command Points (CP) at the beginning of your turn. Picking a character and moving/attacking with them uses 1 point (the tank takes 2). You can select the same character and have them attack over and over as long as you have CP to spend. When that character is active you run them to whatever position or place of cover you'd like, typically somewhere that has a good sight line on which enemy you plan on shooting. If enemies can see you they will shoot at you. You do this until you wish to end your turn or run out of CP; of which then it's the enemy's turn to do likewise.  Characters fall into 5 classes: Scouts: High stamina for moving a greater distance than any other class. Low attack power, but good at harassing non-armored enemies. Shocktrooper: Smg-carrying frontline troop that can do a lot of damage when they get into close range. They can't run nearly as far as a Scout can, but they have much better armor and HP for soaking up hits. Lancer: Anti-armor rocket soldier with limited ammo. Low stamina. Engineer: Support soldier that can repair the tank, distribute ammo and put up sandbags for others to take cover behind. Sniper: Low stamina soldier that uses a scoped rifle to typically headshot high value targets from a distance.  What's cool about the squad you build is that they all have passive traits that add a interesting twist to things. Some characters have a pollen alergy, which means if you have them standing or taking cover near some bushes they'll suffer a penalty for it. Whereas others are born leaders and give a defensive boost to any comrades that're standing near them. There are of ton of little traits like these and your characters learn more as you play.  The game certainly has it's fair share of cutscenes, reasonably well voice-acted. You can even choose to skip the ones that deal more with character delvelopement and less on the main story. The story itself is decent enough, but it is very anime, if you know what I'm getting at.  Hell, they did a whole animated series based off this game. So you could just watch that if you're only after the story. The game, like I mentioned previously, is a pretty good tactical rpg nonetheless.  "
"IMO this is an outstanding game.  if your considering buying Valkyria chronicles, I would highly recommend it, the story line is A+, a game where you will actually want to watch the cut scenes instead of just clicking past them, the game mechanics are simple enough to get right into the game, and enjoyable enough to keep you playing through to the end, most of the characters in the game are endearing, and you will feel the up's and down's the game throws at you via the storyline.....30 years of pc gaming under my belt and i'd say this game is in my all time top 5 played. 5 stars mofo's"
One of the best games I ever played and I played a lot of games both on ps and pc.
"Like many others have already said, XCOM:EU in an anime costume. Not only because it's an excellent turn-based tactical strategy game but also because it's well-paced, has a good learning curve and doesn't outstay its welcome."
Unique style that was very enjoyable
Any Tactical RPG lover should get this game. It is one of the best tactical RPG i've played.
"First time ever playing this game and I'll say for $20 I wasn't dissapointed. The port is quirky as hell, but tolerable. The art style still looks fairly good despite the game's age. And the gameplay holds up pretty well.  I recommend picking this up if you like strategy games."
"If you like xcom this game is for you. if you liked Fire Emblem:Awakening, this game is for you. It's such a great game and I love it. 10/10. Awesome story."
"Japanese X-com, but in a really good way. I especially like how the characters in your squad aren't just random mooks sent to be cannon fodder in your squad. By the way, black haired people are treated like sub humans."
love gameplay and story
"Probably one of my biggest gripes is Holly hell the attempting to maneuver the Eldweiss is one of the wonkiest damn things that 65% of the time results in me going' Why the ♥♥♥♥ did you just spin around to show your rear to the enemy?!' Luckily I have an engineer with the tank at all times else I'd say it is infuriating. But still Wonky as ♥♥♥♥ Tank controlling, I know it was made for PS console but URGH!!!"
Have you ever heard someone mention an empire in a good way? It's no different in this game. Empire BAAAD. You GOOOOD. lol     The only thing you'll hate is controlling the tank. AAAARGH  buy this game.
"I'm really in two minds about this game. On the one hand, it's a beautifully crafted experience with tense and touching moments.  But then there is the gameplay. I get frustrated a lot by it. Moving and shooting with the same character multiple times was a terrible idea in my opinion. Makes it nearly pointless to take more than one unit of each class to a battle, since you're allowed to shoot over and over again with the same unit. Once you moved into a comfortable position, you can easily annihilate any footsoldier around you with a single unit. You're supposed to act as a squad, not John Rambo.  If you're in the enemy's cone of vision, they will fire at you continuously. The only way to look around unmolested is to go into aim mode....assuming you haven't fired that turn of course. They should only be shooting when you MOVE! Either have real time combat or don't, having elements of both makes it akward and frustrating, especially against enemies who can insta kill with their reaction fire.  Flanking is nonexistent in this game. You can crouch behind sandbags which will initiate crouch mode. In crouch mode, you take significantly less damage no matter where the shots are coming from...so you can walk up to a crouching enemy and headshot him point blank, he won't take critical damage. Sure, it works both ways but it's not a good mechanism.  Another fundamental problem is the overhead map. It can only be used to select units (and the occasional special order thingy). You cannot observe the battlefield properly, just pick a unit and run for it. Unless you played a level before and memorized the situation, you won't be able to plan ahead at all.  I guess games like Xcom EU spoiled me too much.﻿  Despite all that, I enjoy the game enough to recommend it if cheesy anime doesn't bother you."
Played through this on the PS3. Probably one of my favorite games. Looking forward to playing through it again on the PC!
Better war story than all CoD's combained. Also waifus and pig's with wings. ♥♥♥♥ are huge in this one.
"another srpg series that sega neglected, sometimes you can hear the gurgles of sega drowning shining force in the distance while playing this  A/10"
"Fantastic art style, good story, high amount of customization and unique characters. I'm not into turn based or strategic games but I found the gameplay so much fun that I recommend it to everyone. One last thing: the port is very good, I never had low fps or stuttering."
"Played the demo on psn years back, but only played the full title when it came to steam. Basically Sega created a full scale version of 'advanced wars' as a semi 3rd person shooter game. One of the very few games I can actually play for longer periods :/ 9/10 on everything except the story.the story I'm gonna give a 4/10 because of the direction it took in later chapters.   "
"Great unique 3rd person real-time/turn-based strategy game. As you progress through the large amount of missions and story, your army recruits gains their own personality/traits/skills/levels. This gives your army a more personal feeeling. Which is added to by the fact if a recruit dies in battle...they dead. Valk Chron starts out simple enough but later missions will definately test your tactical skills.   Played this long ago during the ps3 release and beat it. Remember liking the game a lot, so I grabbed the pc version and am very glad I did. Still a top quality game."
"When i first played this game on the ps3 i couldn't put it down. The story, art style and combat are all amazing. Even though I haven't had the time i would like to play it, my 5 hours so far have been bug free and playing with an xbox controller really helps but the keyboard and mouse do an admirable job. Hopefully SEGA will notice the popularity of Valkyria Chronicles and we get the 2nd and 3rd game as well. Even though they were on the PSP i still would like to play them. Anyway would recommend 10/10 hands down. Oh and also you get all the DLC for free, how crazy's that?"
"Sorry my english isn't good.  I playing this game on ps3. For my is the best console game.  Why i buy pc version if i have this game on ps3?  Because this game is epic :D I want to support such productions.  This game have soul, no like CoD.   I hope the Sega create 2 and 3 episode valkyria for pc :)  + -Graphic -Music and sounds -Story -Gameplay -Characters -Very long (no like CoD 5h and end) -Best pc port ever -M&amp;A style :3 -Upgrade units -All dlc  -Real war (racizm, fighting and dying kids)  -60 fps -Japan voice acting (but english isn't bad)  - -So many cutscenes -Stupid AI -No multiplayer!! -Addictive xD   9,5/10"
"This was a great rpg from start to finish. As a big rpg fan, mostly favoring jrpg's, I would recommend this game to any rpg fan, or just about any gamer. It has many features unique that you will not find in most of your cookie cutter rpg games. The story is pretty good, nothing fantastic, but enjoyable. The combat system is refreshing from the traditional turn-based style. I actually enjoyed the fights. Also, there is no grind from random battles, as you choose when to grind by using the skirmishes. I didn't '100% clear' in my playthrough, but I did manage to get most of it within ~55 hours of play. All my classes were level 16, except sniper at 17. The level cap is 20. This game was worth every penny, and it left that mixed feeling of sad and satisfied when you finish a truly enjoyable game."
"A game I had been waiting for. Having played VC2 on the PSP, I instantly fell in love with the game's mechanics, storyline, and storyline. I had to play more, but VC3 was not released in English, and VC1 was only on the PS3. I bought the PS3 version disk despite not having a PS3 just to support the developers. After playing this I would say it met my expectations, and brought me the same level of entertainment as its successor.   Things I liked:  1) Simple gameplay style 2) Customizability of squad and weapons 3) Support for 4K resolution 4) Well-drawn anime renderings 5) Storyline (may be cliche for some people)  Please do note that this game introduces the basic concepts to you at first (basic how-to-play), and then gets increasingly difficult as the story progresses. This may be good or bad for some people.   Also, in one part of the game my character fell through the floor and died due to some glitch. It only happened once though."
"Valkyria Chronicles ultimately delivers a pretty good tactical rpg, with a plethora of amusing characters to pad out your teams. Although the AI is at times lamentable...mostly lamentable, and the fictionalized World War II style setting gradually enters into stiff anime trope land the game is still a total gem and well worth a playthrough, and likely a second playthrough so you can good around with your ridiculously overpowered scouts and shocktroopers.  Pros: Find that special character, give them all the best weaponry, feel pride when they machine gun an enemy in the face at point blank range. Your enemies all have weakpoints...like their head...or the incredibly poorly designed exposed heat sink on the back of their tank...don't feel bad using it. The real joy that comes from having four or five shocktroopers all standing beside one another and focus firing on a single opponent or boss, 'Oh, I see he needs twelve more hits to kill, I'll just multiply that by four, then multiply that by four, and then aim for his head for a bonus.' Horrifying injuries to your squad? You just saw your lancer literally twisted 180 degrees around, tiwtching as he clutches his own butt, staring blankly ahead and screaming? Don't worry, the medic will get them back to the front lines in one turn. Do you like Skies of Arcadia? Surprise, the cast is here.  Cons: Terrible AI. Cheating AI (They will head shot you with a tank shell from across the map...consider it a challenge) Gets really tropey, especially at the end. Frustrating ranking system that rewards speed over strategy. Absurd twists in missions, especially late game that artificially raise the difficulty."
"One of the most interesting titles this year has to offer. Originaly realesed on PS3 six years ago, unknown title for many now availivable on PC. Unique combination of light strategy, action and rpg make this game very enjoyable while story plot keep's you wondering what will happen next.  A must play for all anime fan's out there and a really good game to check out for everyone else.  As for me big thumb's up, the game is totaly worth playing!  "
"Thank you, Sega for bringing this awesome game to PC and making the localization right!! The DLC is included, the graphics scale well, and the Japanese original voices are a selectable option. And it doesn't crash or have irritating pay for victory issues."
"-Good music -Nice Graphics -Good story. - build your own Army regiment, with unique people and weapons. -good ports and good games  10/10"
"So the day it was released on Steam was first time i ever heard of Valkyria Chronicles - it looked like some kind of typical jRPG on cover, so it took my interest. Then i looked on screenshots and thought 'it looks nice and people says it's really worth time/money, so why not take it?'. A bit more research gave me more insight on this one - Turn based tactical TPS/FPS with elements of rpg - how the hell did they managed to do that? After first mission it all became clear. THIS IS AWESOME.  At first it looks easy(take cover, shoot, advance), but after 2-3 missions it became clear to me, that this game will give me hard time. It was like: - So... there's occupied town with sh*tload of tanks, snipers, troopers and anything else, that will try to kill you, we need you to take that town back. - Wait wat? - Take your tank, few people from your squad aaaand we need that town back asap. - Why not send some experienced soldiers and few heavy tanks there? - Because of reasons. - What reasons? - Because you are peasants we just recruited AND WE CAN'T POSSIBLY SEND THERE ACTUAL ARMY. They are busy dying and such.  There was missions where i thought 'yep, i'm screwed' and then needed to rethink tactics, people from squad i took for the mission and few other things, like 'how enemy will behave, if i do this' and such. Well i guess tactical games are mostly for things like that. Did i like it? Yes. There was a lot of planning, creating backup plans in case if someone screws up('Oscar, if you gonna miss that guy once more i'm gonna punch you in the face, SRSLY') and even more planning, when backup plan failed or i made some kind of mistake, that screwed up my whole plan. Then more planning, yes.  So the game itself as an idea - it's really great. There's a bit problems with physics in this game, some rules like crouching disables critical damage(balance-wise i guess?), controls(mostly tank maneuvers), lack of some info(like distance to target, which is essential to lancers for example). But again those problems haven't made me leave this game - story is nice(i guess it's more like 'anime-style' ?), winning mission gives self-satisfaction and with RPG elements there's characters progress, that can actually make difference. Graphics despice lack of AA for example were really nice(again anime-styled), japanese dub also was made fully professional(i think i recognized some well-known seiyus) and it was a lot of fun. I don't regret even minute spend on this game.  Quality of conversion(or port, like some people like to call it) - despise few things like tanks controls and occasional fps drops(but rather rarely - most of the times gameplay is smooth) it's really nice conversion - Sega actually made something worth mentioning.   Pros: - Nice story with ww2-like setting - Jap dub option(with really great voiceacting) - Original idea for game - A lot of fun for people, who like tactic/turn based games - Game does not force you to grind, most of the missions can be won without bigger problems with proper planning - Original and beautiful art style  Cons: - Rather low replay value - Quality of eng translation(it's acceptable and didn't loose it's meaning, but could be better)"
"This is one of the Great Gem from SEGA besides Yakuza (Can we get a port?) I've had this on PS3 and thankfully this port is decent and all the DLC rolled in.   Didn't need to buy a PS3 again.   Now to port the sequels, SEGA. (HINT,hint) "
Just as good as I remembered it (played it a few years ago on the PS3).
Had a lot of fun playing it. I'm sure people new to Anime srpg will be able to enjoy it too if you don't mind the cliche anime story telling and wait till you get hard and expert skirmishes difficulties. although once you know how to exploit the missions. this become boring pretty fast.
Great game both on console and on PC. Recomended to anyone that is more concerned about playing tactically than spraying bullets
"Why do you not own this game? Visually appealing, compelling story, and a combat system that never gets old. (to me is). There are more cutscenes then I imagined at first but it really just adds to the depth of the story."
"By far and away my favorite PS3 game. So glad it was brought to Steam, and I have the chance to play it all over again. Looking for a JRPG? How about a Strategy game? Throw in some third person shooter elements while we're at it?  Just buy it already! Maybe if we throw enough money at Sega I'll finally be able to play Valkyria Chronicles 3."
"Good story, fast gameplay, fun characters. Good for replay, too.  Only one glitch to watch out for: The stairs in Chapter 15 part a. You fall through them a lot. Reloading does not always help"
9/10. If you are a fan of strategy games this is definetely a game for you. This is personally the most interesting and best strategy game I've ever played
"Great battles, nice art, tons of fun. If you like ww2 games then dont miss this. Might be fiction but its still great. 9/10 Beetle-Tastic!!!!!!"
"Fantastic strategy game. Has a small hint of RPG, but not too much. It's excellently ported to PC, looks great, and not overly anime looking.  And story... well... this is the only game besides the Metal Gear saga and Indigo Prophecy where I actually cared about the characters."
"Great game. Good story, unique yet fun gameplay. Best played with a controller howerver."
Good times
Alicia best girl Be my waifu pls 10/10 would create harem again
Creative and fun turn based combat. Similar to Xcom in gameplay but with 3rd person control of each movement and a lengthy anime story
"great game, can't wait for valk chronicles 2 ^^"
Great port wish every port could be as good and complete as this one. Works fine with controller or keys and mouse. So RELEASE VC2 and 3!
"Its fun tactics RPG set in fake World War 2, but close enough for me, I plan on beating this game in its entiredy"
"Awesome game, great game play, interesting story.."
"Awesome take on turn based, and a fantastic console port. BUY IT NOW"
"And RTS game pretty unique, with a great history and interesting characters... My only complain would be that everyone is civilians in the squad, and all of the sudden they are ok with killing soldier, really messed up guys... Kinda psychopathic... Nonetheless the game is fun"
Amazing and delightful.
Amazing game for its time.
not the most interesting game ever made but good if you like startegy/rpg/turn based games
"fantastic game, if you love turn base and anime you must own this game! or if you like either its brilliant"
i &lt;3 this game :) good story  interesting game mechanic amaizing cell shader graphic
This game is pretty bro. Like what you'd imagine ww2 to be like if it was fought by cute kawaii anime girls. Fun/10
this's much much better than X-com.
This is a great port of a great game.
"If you like/love the original Anime which of this game is based on, you'll absolutely love the game.  I just started to play it but it's enough to give a short review. In this game you will be able to 'play' the Anime, the main story is the same. But there are some small changes between the game and the Anime, in my opinion it's refreshing the story and I like the small alteration in the story too.  This game introduce a new gameplay way (new to me at least!), the Story is mostly told by cutscenes, the most action you will see is during battle times.  During these battles, you have a round based system where you can choose what action you want to do with which character, everytime you choose a character you loose let's call them action points.  When you run out of these your round end, and the enemy will make his turn. "
"Simple game yet very interesting storyline..   If you want new kind of battle System in a game, i recommend this game for you... touching story too...almost like the anime itself :-)"
All someone has to do now is bring us Skies of Arcadia so we can enjoy some console greats. #pcmasterrace
"Valkyria Chronicles tells the story of a neutral nation trapped between two superpowers in a strangereal WWII scenario. The plot features large, sweeping events, but is carried by the momentum of its wonderful characters. You will never see a game that is quite like the watercolored graphics with its grand yet personal story. All of this is brought to life by the beautiful CANVAS engine, which makes the entire game look like a watercolor painting.  The gameplay is a hybrid of turn-based strategy and third-person shooter. On your turn, you can expend Command Points to move your troops into position and conduct actions. The fun part is to position your troops strategically to trap enemies in cross-fire when they move. Plus, you have to deal with a variety of troops and encounters with armored vehicles. With hours upon hours of gameplay in the main quest and a bunch of side missions, including the already-bundled DLCs, there really is no game out there like Valkyria Chronicles. You owe it to yourself to play this gem."
"There are a few minor issues with the port. Mouse controls while driving the tank can be frustrating for example, but this is an excellent game."
this game is like so good.
"This game is amazing, really enjoyed playing it. It runs smooth the gamplay is fun, the art is nice plus a good story to follow if your into that but I liked it. it's a turn based strategy game like x-com but you play it in a third person as well, you can custom your team and upgrade your gear.  get this game you won't regret a thing. "
Smash dudes with Alicia and more Alicia and listen to cool music
Love it! Finally made it past the point where I bailed on my console. Challenging yet fun game.
"What can I say that hasn't already been said? It'a beautiful, the combat is engaging and tense, and most of all it's fun! It puts a cool new twist on tatical gameplay and makes everything feel fresh."
Worth the money!
Just try and find a game that lets you recruit cuter child soldiers than this one.
"Love this game, like xcom except like anime and has more feels.. good port btw"
Ohmygod this is one of my favorite RPG's ever. The art style is amazing and the characters rock. 10/10
"Valkyria Chronicles is a great game. It follows the story of the anime with minor changes to it. The play style is a turn base with real time put in meaning XCOM's overwatch is constant until you end the turn. Saying that it is also the worst thing (ex. Your running at a solider doing a blitz type move and suddenly a distraction pops up. You are still being fired upon and taking damage eventhough you arent moving and just being afk. Also, at times when starting a turn for someone in range they are already fired upon before you can move.) I understand the realism in it but, it can get fustrating at times.  Other then that, if you love XCOM you'll right at home with this game. Instead of % to hit it gives you a ratio of 'Hits to kill / Shots fired', you can aim your sights for headshots or weak spots on tanks.   Since this is a JRPG expect grinding in this game! 9/10"
Definitely in my top 10 games of all time
"ITS SO BEAUTIFUL.... Everything from VC1 + DC are ported over for a value package with the bonus addition of increasing the resolution to 1080p at 60fps. Encounter 1 bug where my character fell through the world, but this instance only happened once and nevered happened again. If your a fan of chess style games like X-COM, you should totally play it."
Loved the game
My favorite game in recent 3 years.
"Okay so I played and beat this game on Playstation 3 a long time ago. This game is still wonderful except for one thing that can and will completely ruin this game for you. The tank physics are broken as all hell. You will move your tank and then all of a sudden your camera will shake like mad and you will lose your tank's movement phase. If you can get past that then this game is amazing. Wonderful story, awesome characters, and fun gameplay. I say that you should pick this up on a sale. The reason for that is because of the tank physics. The devs said they fixed them, but I still have the issue and I know a few others who do too. Otherwise here is to a hopeful patch to fix them and maybe to even see this games sequals get ported too (Mainly the third one)."
"A masterpiece of a game that missed its fame and fortune due to obscurity. Even as a port of a 2008 game the visuals hold up incredibly, aside for cutscenes which use the original ps3 footage. All I can hope for is that this release brings the game to the standing that it should have had from the beginning, and revitalizes the series."
"Honestly, it seems i missed this magnificent game from my search list, released in 2009 and i just found this on Steam in 2014. hilarious  A story about a fictional war where destiny decided to create a fateful meeting between Welkin and Alicia where their path revolved around the war. As their journey from a complete stranger, war comrade, and until became a lover, there's always a conflict hindering them. Reunion, Happiness, Death, etc,etc. which gave you quite a tear jerking moment.  Pros -Great story -Nice art ( despite being 5 years old ) -Good soundtrack  Cons -FPS drop when played using integrated graphics -OP Scout  So if you love a Japanese TRPG with splendid storyline, you should try this. i assure you, it's worth the price"
"You know the feeling in XCOM where you just lost your soldier from a brute in combat because of your bad judgement and slowly seeing your squad turn into mush in every horrible turn?  Ok now replace the word 'soldier' to 'waifu', 'brute' to 'tanks' and 'every horrible turn' to 'in real time'.  That's Valkyria Chronicles."
Great Game!  Played Valkyria Chronicles 2 on the PSP and loved it. Good thing they released the PC version thru steam.  Gameplay: 9/10  Great storyline and a very lengthy game time. :)
Band of Brothers the anime!
It's literally Fire Emblem with TPS mechanics in a Strategy environment!! This is perfect!!!
"A typical SLG game, a.k.a. save-load-game. However, almost half playing time was wasted on watching battle CG, which is impossible to skip.   "
One of my most favorite games that I've ever played  Highly recommended to anyone
"This game is fresh and new, and the combat system is different. The storyline seems a bit melodramatic and cliche, but the game itself is very fun. If you are into turn based anime action, I would recommend this game."
Great turnbased gameplay that still felt different from anything else I've played because of how they handled the realtime part of it. Also had a solid story
One of my favorite strategy games. unique and enjoyable story. Pretty good artwork. I own it for two systems and have played through the story multiple times.   There is minor balace issues that make you favor certain units and i wish there was custom maps. Pc also has a small ragdoll death problem where bodies flop arround for half a second and the game continues. It is still a good game.  Please buy it and encourage others to also.I hope they release the third one in N. america.
"In a Japanese game originally for the PS3 that emulates WWII Europe, you play a militia commander in (Belgium) little Gallia. The game displays innovative turn-based combat illustrated with watercolor anime graphics.  The Good: Combat offers multiple strategies to acheive victory Characters have personalities, and backstories Story gives very interesting parallels to WW2  The Cons: Nature of leader characters means you will probably use three characters in every missions to the exclusion of most of the other non-leader characters Victory conditions are usually only 'Capture the Base' Game rewards speedy victory and NOTHING ELSE Mission briefs give you bare bones information. Most missions requrie you to do a test run to even figure out what the map looks like.  While the 'Best Strategy' is always rushing with your high-mobility units, replayablity is decent such that you can play through again for fun, or just have a lot of save files. It will probably take you a while to 'get' this game, but it will probably remain challenging, and if not it is very easy to challenge yourself.  Certainly worth it for at least one playthrough if its on sale."
Game is great. Great PC port from the PS3. Im hoping it gets the recgintion it deserves. Id recomend it to any stragtey game fan.
"Had this game on console, happy to see it on Steam:  VC was a solid, if undersold game in its initial release. The port is solid although very straight: menus are still key-driven when mouse support would be better although this only applies to inter-mission functions so it doesn't impede gameplay. Likewise there's two bindings for what would usually be a 'confirm' key because it's built around the Playstation-style controller.   As a game, VC is a strong SRPG (of sorts). One thing an SRPG veteran of games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Nippon Ichi's library will note is that it's a bit tame in comparison: levels are applied to all soldiers of a given class and experience is dispensed at your discretion in between missions. The typical peculiarity of SRPGs where the focus is getting the right person to make the kill to level isn't present for better or worse. This means all your, say scouts, will behave similarly. While each soldier in your army has set traits called 'potentials' which vary their usefulness, it makes shifting tactics easier than most SRPGs because you don't have to worry about pulling in some under-leveled sub for a mission where one more sniper would be optimal. In all the experience is slightly more forgiving than most SRPGs, making it a good genre introduction.   The art style is one of the most striking elements of the game, done in a rare case of cel-shaded anime-style graphics looking very good. The cartoonish style helps the game as well because the graphics have aged far less in terms of appeal than many more realistic games of the same age. The story is a bit maligned, being somewhat crippled with anime cliches and rather infamous for the sheer number of morals it sort of clumisly handles but it never came across as a deal-breaker. No big 'WTF' moment that made me particularly call BS on the whole thing. If nothing else, there's a lot of amusement to be had at how apparently casual the army you're in is run.  VC1 was not the most fine-tuned game of the series, which benefitted a lot in later installments from the lessons learned in this game. Scouts in particular are noticably overpowered not long into the game and one scout in particular (you'll know the one) becomes so murderous that most missions turn into rushing her with the rest of your cast just trying to back up her tank-shooting, soldier-executing uber-rampage. While SRPGs are no stranger to overpowered builds like the Holy Calculator of FFT fame, it reflects poorly on design when you can wind up with OP characters more or less by accident. Still, it's something they resolved later on and it hardly hinders the game as a whole."
"Excellent port of a superb game!  Valkyria Chronicles was a big suprise when it was release on PS3 six years ago, but the gameplay, visuals and story is as good today as it was in the original. Don't let the cute (but gorgeous) visuals fool you into thinking this is a kids game for it has considerable depth and offers a real challenge even for players used to strategy/rpg games. Think anime-style meets X-COM and you have a pretty good initial description.  The port is also really well done technically and should be a landmark for how console ports SHOULD be done. Well done SEGA, well done indeed.  PROS: * Interesting story and likable main characters that you actually care about * Deep and challenging strategy battles * Ranking system of every battle that offers good replay value * Different Character classes, upgrades, training, outfitting, orders etc. Gives a lot of flexibility in how you play your battles * Port enables multi hi-res video modes with 60p. Included also original japanese voice with eng. subtitles * Includes all optional DLC's. * Askingprice of 19 euros is a bargain. Don't think, just get it....Seriously, just get it..  If you're a fan of JRPG, anime and like strategy combat games this is a no-brainer. A classic you owe yourself not to miss out on."
Not WWII with anime.
Fun game. Bit old now but wish they made more on pc. 8/10
Made an army of waifus then went to war against not-Hitler. Game of the Year 2008.
"Living in a small country that borders Russia, I immediately related to the people of Gallia, fighting a big, expansionistic empire. I also couldn't help, but notice some events in the glossary that are extremely familliar to events that happened in real life.  It's quite challenging at times and unless you're willing to spend the lives of your troops or savescum, every action must be carefully considered.  Hopefully we'll get the second and the third game too."
An amazing game with a great story and a beautiful soundtrack. I really enjoyed playing this game in the time ive spent playing it.
"Great Storyline, Great Graphics and, an incredible and enjoyable Battle System will let you more than satisfied to buy this game...  Anime Style, a pretty drammatic story, a pretty cool turn based strategy system turned this game in one the best game i played on the Genre.  Dont think much, and give a try, you will not regret it for sure. Enjoy!"
"I'll keep this simple.  rating: 9/10  pros: - memorable characters (not just the protagonists, but also the rank-and-file soldiers and the antagonists) - interesting story - interesting gameplay  cons: - driving tanks is difficult when using mouse and keyboard "
"Valkyria Chronicles is an SRPG, with full 3d freedom on map, as well as certain real-time elements.  To prevent either side from moving units through a formation, most units will intercept any enemy unit that is trying to move near it while the enemy unit is moving.  Combined with manual aiming and risk taking (example: do you risk missing a headshot that would eliminate the enemy unit in one turn, or go for the body that is guaranteed in 2 turns) it makes for an incredibly well balanced tactical game.  The characters and plot are quite well written too, making for an interesting background for an alternate WWII setting."
"Let's all send a message to SEGA under the banner:  YES! We want more games like these! Just give us the opportunity to buy them, and they will sell.  I, like many whom likely downloaded this game, adore this franchise with its enthralling narrative and completely unique battle system. Given how well this game sold and how far beyond SEGA's expectations it performed the market for this game is now more alive than ever.  I could ramble on and on about how much this game does right, but I'm guessing if you're bothering to read this than you've already made your decision on this game. (If you haven't, well go ahead and watch one of the videos on how this game performs. If you are interested in what you see, I can with utmost certainty guarantee you'll love this game and assure you the price tag is more than worth it.) Instead, I would like to make this appeal to SEGA, should the incredibly off chance that they read these reviews occur.  If you have an inkling to do an HD remaster, or at the very least a port of Valkyria Chronicles 2 for the PSP, by all means please do. I believe that this release should be more than enough evidence the fanbase exists and wants it. I would even go a step further and plead for an English release of Valkyria Chronicles 3, debatebly the pinnacle of the series doomed to be out of reach of us western fans due to percieved bad sales of its predecessor. Now is the time to relaunch the series. The fans want it, and it has been proven. So I thank you for allowing the fans to enjoy this game once again, and I plea, grant us more!"
A pig with wings joins the army. 10/10
"As a Fire Emblem fan this game has been more than a pleasant surprise. I never owned a playstation but had always heard this game was great. Now I can't stop playing it. The story is great, better than most modern games with more emotional depth and interesting character development. The hybrid SRPG tactical maneuvers are cleverly implemented and the way the game unfolds is a joy to behold. If you like story-driven games with a tactical RPG twist I highly recommend it."
If you don't fall in love with the art alone this game isn't for you. One of the best turn based strategy games I've ever played and I am so glad to finally see it on PC after sinking many hours into it on PS3.
I love this game and the seiries as a whole. Unfortunatly however this port has a few bugs that broke the emersion for me primaraly visual but nothing game breaking.
"Awesome mix of strategy, RPG and third-person shooter elements."
"exellent game, can't stop playing since buying it. The only problem is those visual glitch with integred graphics"
"I went into this game almost completely blind, only knowing that it was a bit like XCOM, what I found however was quite possibly one of my favourite games ever.   Lets just get the cons out of the way first: 1. The story can at some points feel a bit cheesy and predictable 2. The controls, especially for the tanks were a bit clunky and hard to maneuver sometimes. 3. (Slight Spoiler) There was mention of building a plane mid way through the game, leading me to believe that it would be usable in a later mission, and allthough it was nice how it was used, I would have liked to use it a sort of sky assault mission.  Yay Pros: 1. The Anime style, although off-putting in parts due to some Anime traits (I'm looking at you Selvaria!), ends up supporting the story very well. 2. The JRPG/FPS style present seems to fit very well, adding an extra layer of strategy sometimes and in my opinion, giving this game an edge over similar games in the JRPG genre. 3. The characters grew on me quite a bit during the game, to the point that once a unit fell in battle the mission quickly turned to a rescue mission, trying to get a medic to them as soon as possible. 4. The amount of backstory to everything in this game is immense, and although I didn't read everything, the side-missions especially gave a great deal of backstory not only to the characters, but also why they are the way they are. 5. The pseudo-WWII setting, and the idea of a small, neutral country stuck in the middle between two super-powers made the story very excitingly fictional, while still drawing some inspiration from real-life events.  6. It remided me a lot of Fire Emblem, which is probably why I love it so much because I love Fire Emblem :)"
"Think of this game as an anime version of X-Com: Enemy Unknown where instead of aliens you fight in a cyberpunk World War II-ish scenario. Fun if you have a plan, punishing if you are reckless in your strategies. (You can save mid game if you are having too hard a time) Love the art style too."
"This game is basically XCOM built from Japanese design philosophies. It's a load of fun, rewarding and challenging tactical gameplay. A fun story, great music, great characters, and a beautiful and unique visuals.   It is also a splendid PC port, just don't run your monitor refresh rate higher than 60. You can end up with some physics issues.  I had a lot of fun with this title. I think it's well worth the purchase price."
An amazing twist of Fire Emblem like strategy with Star Wars Battlefront like combat. Sound strange? I know. A great buy even if it isn't on sale.
"Beautiful Anime art style combined with quite challenging play that will make you think very hard on what your next move will be. Interface can be a little confusing however, and tank control will take quite a while to get used to. Nonetheless, I still like this game very much, adding storyline and tactical turn based combat. A beautiful and smart game, extremely glad I purchased it.  9/10"
"More like a puzzle game than a tactical RPG, as an XCOM Difficult Ironman fanatic, I still had a few nice hours looking at the colorful and nice pictures. for 15 euros I had a good time. lets call it an appetizer wait for a cheap price."
"Simply one of the best turn-based strategy games ever made. This game is a brilliant blend of excellent storytelling and exquisite gameplay, substained by wonderful presentation, graphics and music. Everything about the game is just so awesome that i couldn't really say anything bad about it if i tried. The only way you can possibly not like the game is if you absoultely hate both anime and turn-based games, yet even then you should think twice, since the story is emotionally deeper than you would expect judging by the cartoonish looks and the turn-based mechanics are brilliantly spiced up by allowing the player to move freely in real time during the turns, making it a unique and incredibly clever example of genre evolution that simply eliminates any of the historically weak points of those kind of games, like lack of exciting action and sluggyness. Gameplay is deep, strategic, yet at the same time absolutely accessible and quick to get used to. Learning curve is perfect, the game is always challenging at every level without ever being frustrating. The storytelling pacing is flawless. Despite having at disposal several characters, each and every one of them is portrayed in a different fashion, with unique features and you will definetely get fond of them. Except for the main characters, they can permanently die, but you'll definetely find yourself replaying missions to avoid it if it happens because of how emotionally attached you'll grow to them. You'll cry for them, you'll laugh, and you'll definetely love them. The graphics is not state-of-the-art for today's standards, being it a early PS3 game, yet the cel-shaded art style is so unique and gracious that it probably would still look good in a thousand years. It somehow looks like a mix of an anime and a artsy looking painting, thanks to 'hand drawn' effects and comic-book-like onomatopoeia balloons that give the whole thing a unique and unforgettable style. The music is a precious thing by itself. I swear by God i would still buy the CD if no game existed. It one of the best soundtracks you'll ever hear for a videogame. The game is even pretty replayable thanks to the evaluations that challenge you to get those hard to earn yet so satisfying A-Ranks in every battle. If my review seem a little bit too enthusiastic and you are still skeptical, well, it's just because the game is as close to a perfect 10 game as it gets. Give it a try and you won't regret it. You'll remember forever it as a magnificent story that will enrich your soul and as one of the best games you ever played."
"A truly enjoyable experience and a great JRPG. Within the first few missions I was hooked on the game already, the characters all truly enjoyable and each with their own personalities and well voice acted, I would definitely recommend this game to any JRPG lovers."
"A strong turn based tactics game but done in 1st person. Wait, what? There's no grid like modern XCOM, but an Action Point system like old XCOM -you select a solider and run them were you want to go and shoot in 1st person (though it still has a chance of failure no matter how good your aim is). The visuals hold up pretty well for being a console port of a game that is, by now, reasonably old - though that's helped by the anime visual style, which doesn't require the kind of fidelity you'd need for photo-realism.  Overall, entertaining, challenging (at least it was for me) and a lasting experience that could easily have been an anime tv series instead.  Small gripes include no mouse support in the menus - the mouse works fine during game play, would it have been so hard to add it to the menus?"
"Truly a fantastic experience. Gameplay is solid, a challenge yet alway engaging. I could not put this down.  Story is wonderful and fun. "
"Very fun game. the combat starts off a little confusing, doesnt have much of a detailed tutorial but once you really get used to it the game itself kinda grows on you.  but buyers beware, if you use a Intel HD grahics card, dont play this game because the character models will be all wonky like mine are."
"Beautiful voice acting and compelling storyline, this is a must have for turn-base strategy RPGs."
This game is very good. Its like a blend of Xcom and Fire Emblem.
"Valkyria Chronicles easily ranks as my favorite game of all time. Strategic combat, solid rpg elements, as well as a masterfully crafted and paced story, this game has it all. I would recommend it to anyone without reservation!"
"One of the best SRPG/Tactics games you can play. I originally had this for my PS3 a few years back, but I never got around to finishing it. Randomly purchased the game at a discounted rate and decided to give it another go. I've not regretted that decision at all. I've sunk 7hrs into it, so far and I'm on Chapter-5. The game is extremely entertaining and the gameplay mechanics are easy to pick up, very fun to learn and have a good deal of depth for you to master.  The game is a mix of X-COM, Fire Emblem and Fallout. The free-form combat navigation of X-COM, the risk of permanently losing your units like Fire Emblem and the V.A.T.S style shooting mechanics of Fallout.  The anime aesthetics are very appealing, even to non-anime and casual fan. The characters are lighthearted, likeable and easy to care for. The tone of the game is very fun, for the most part, but there are some 'dark' moments and the obvious allegories/allusions to WW-II, Nazi's and the discrimination of Jews is pretty apparent. It's all balanced well, though and there's a good deal of levity in the narrative to keep things from going out of hand.   This is a great purchase if you're looking for something different to play or want to revisit an old PS3 classic that's made even better on PC. I don't have a gaming rig, I just play on my HP 15 laptop, but even then I can run the game at a smooth 30FPS with 1366x768 resolution. Slightly higher than the PS3's 720p, same frame-rate, though turning on the V-Sync causes 'slow-motion' issues for me. In case you were on the fence, though and you needed a tech spec comparison, this game will run amazingly on even low-end gaming PC's and runs just a smidge better on a non-gaming, 2014 laptop than the PS3 counterpart. Awesome game, please support it."
A nice turn-based strategy with aesthetics of world war 1 and supernatural powers
"Unique gameplay that combines RTS, Turn based strategy games and FPS, check. Great characters and character designs, check. Predictable but rich and moving storyline, check. Painting-like animation, check. Godly OST, check.  10/10, buy it if you've never played it before. Solid game despite it's age, I guarnatee it's going to be a great experience for you even if you're not looking at it through nostalgia goggles."
"anime style warfare, thats how i like it. only one thing, i feel sorry for when i kill imperials while there on the ground critically ingured :( what i did one time was some guy was saying 'mother, you dont have to worry, im coming home' and when i walked a unit over him, hes dead. i felt SO BAD so freaking bad that i killed that guy :(:(:( "
"I absolutely love this game, amazingly fun gameplay, love the characters and this soundtrack, I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT! its a amazing game! must buy! worth every penny! JUST BUY IT ALREADY LOL."
Awesome game! Recommended to everyone and TBS players in particular!
"I didn't have a PS3 at the time, and I still don't. After finding out the sequels were debuting on PSP, I was even more discouraged because of the inconsistency of its release.  Although unexpected, I'm glad I was patient enough to see a PC re-release! With amazing sales and topping charts like no other, this should be a no-brainer for SEGA to release the sequel(s) for PC! If this doesn't provide them enough convincing, then I'm not sure what else will.  Anyway, for something that offers 3rd Person Tactical, Strategy, RPG and such an amazing story (which I've grown attached to all the characters at this point), I consider this my #1 game of all time. I'm going to be playing this for hours on end to make sure I collect every part, weapon and achievements possible. What an amazing jewel, this game."
"I love this game but two people fail so hard at what they do it makes me rage.  Dear Welkin and Largo,  You had one job. You failed it. I sent in Wendy. Everyone died.  Wendy/10 would put c4 in my hat again."
♥♥♥♥ing mission 7 10/10 would get ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ed by an invincible booby lady again
"To start things off I like to see devs like sega giving some love to their old games by re-releasing them on PC, I was so excited to see one of my favourite ps3 titles go to this platform and since it was released on remembrance day that just made it all the more special to me.  The game is set in a fantasy version of WW2 and in a land called 'Gallia' were a squad called 'Squad 7' is tasked with battling the Imperials (the Nazis I guess) to retake their homeland, this results in a series of large scale skirmishes that are really fun to complete.  You play as Welkin Gunther who commands squad 7 in a tank, you select a member of the squad then go into a third person mode wich then lets you control them for a certain amount of time depending on their AP (agility points) this combined with the excellent balance of different classes in the squad makes it so you can be very imaginative with what you want your characters to do.  The game also has a great upgrade system, depending on how well you have done in a skirmish, you will gain bonus xp and funds to level up your characters and equipment and when your characters get to a certain level, they gain bonus abilities that helps them in certain situations.  the character models and voice acting was always on point and was believable, it felt almost real in times when it was really sad,(despite the pencil/comic finish which looks amazing by the way), they did a good job with the dubbing.  This game took me about 13 hours to complete with the bonus missions and you could easily get about another 4-6 hours doing the rest with the character upgrades and skirmishes.The £20 price tag really suites this game aswell even though it came out in 2007 its good enough for you to feel comfortable paying that.  The ONLY bad thing I have to say about this game (wich is very mior indeed) is the chance that even when your targeting something at point blank range, it still misses, its like in xcom when you have a 99% chance to hit and it misses.  so overall this game doesn't need a score because its too good, but im gonna do it anyway so i'm gonna give it a 9.5/10 just because I feel that it could have done with a multiplayer like what xcom had just to be able to get another 10+ hours out of it and to be able to have another excuse to play it. hope this review helped :)"
"a beautiful game, with moments of laughter and moments of tears."
"Alot of mechanics necassary for a really great game come together nice in this one.   Most important: there is a solid/interesting story to experience (kind of a fantasy retelling of ww2). Main characters are likeable and fleshed out (you should care about them). Gameplay mechanics are turnbased but still dramatic and exciting. Strategy always comes first in a battle. Unlike a few other turnbased games out there, luck is not really a factor in a fight.  Also there is humor, plenty funny characters and again a story remniscent of history but different in interesting ways."
10/10
"Wicked turn based tactical combat, fantasy world based on world war 2 with an anime twitst. Lots of cut scenes, sometimes its silly, but its worth it for the wicked gameplay."
"This game is just such an amazing bargain at its price point. If you're even slightly interested I highly recommend you give it a go. I doubt you'll regret it.  As for my opinion, I'll just let my playtime speak for that as there are already plenty of solid reviews that contain specific info about the game."
10/10 100/100 Game of the year. A-again.
could not stop playing
"I love playing the same level over and over again. because my tank loves to bare its ♥♥♥ at its enemies that love to take advantage. this game is a symbol of malcom in the middle. where frankie munez gets ♥♥♥♥♥ in the ♥♥♥ by lifes challanges and does another 30 min episode to only be ♥♥♥♥♥ again.   my tank flips out like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the candy store. this dlc is worth it. get this game for the kid in the candy store dlc.  no cons  only if you are opposed with flipping tanks that bares its rear at enemies,  "
Enjoy the first chapter of easy mode :)
Just ana amzing game. Anyone who enjoys tatical rpgs needs to play this.
"Really great port of a game that needs to be on the vita *cough cough* that holds up really well. The gameplay is fun and you need to plan your moves so you dont get mowed down by 5 machine gun wielding enemys and that damn tank thats hiding around the corner. I just hope this sells enough to get Valkyria Chronicles 3 into the US! GAHHH why did 2 have to take the kiddy route with the story when this game is alot more mature dealing with everything from racism and concentration camps to hay there just people fighting for their familys too. Its got some dark moments that really add to the emotional feel of the game, again unlike VC2 with played it way to close to the chest. Its lenth, story, chars. and gameplay all work to make this game well worth the 20 doller price tag. If you never played it before get it now. 8/10 -good story and chars. really fun and addicting gameplay that works your brain. and an art style that is great to look at."
Japanese Tactical RPG at its finest ...
"Amazing game, love the real time strategy dynamic, the story is great (watched the Anime, like this one better, still watch the Anime though!!!)."
Turn Based Strategy And Anime Element Works Quite Well I played This Game On PSP Once I love it  SEGA: Please Port Valkyria Chronicles 2 And Valkyria Chronicles 3 Please
"After 6 years SEGA finally released it on PC! Since I don’t have a PS3 I couldn't try it even if I really wanted because I have seen the anime series about the game as well as heard a lot of good about the game, so it was a first day pre-order for me.  The game is awesome a wonderful experience for those who enjoy turn-based combat also with well developed characters, great storytelling and plot. 10/10 I recommend it for everyone who enjoy this type of games and/or anime style."
"It is a great, classic game that is very addictive. The PC port is pretty well done, though there are some glitches that make playing in 60 FPS mode difficult. Also, all the 2D assets and movies are still in 720p even in 1080p mode. However, this does not diminish from the fun of the game and it's definitely worth full price if you never played it.  (Just a note - the store blurb is actually incorrect. Squad 7 isn't the 'Federation's 7th Platoon', it's the Gallian Militia. Gallia is not actually part of the Federation, as the blurb says - they are an independent country)."
AWESOME GAME!!  BUY IT NOW!!
"This game is ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious. Its basically Weeb War II, except Russians are the bad guys, like every FPS war game. That isn't even the funny part. Jews are called Darcsens, and your squad leaders pretty much just ♥♥♥♥ on your Jewish little sister on every opportunity they get. This is more apparent on Japanese voices, since the original dialogue doesn't match the translation. Even the Russians treat the Jews like trash.  11/10, antisemitism has never been more funny"
This game is awesome! :D
You can kill anime Nazis with anime tanks. Tank/10
"Every scene with alicia looks like her head was photoshopped on. 10/10  Seriously- I really enjoy it. Weird mechanics at points, but it's a new style. Would buy again (literally because i already own it on ps3)"
having a lot of fun so far even if rating system isnt good
You can make a Military Harlem!
"Great port, AMAZING game. It's absolutly beautiful artstyle fits the game perfectly and the Turn based gameplay mixed with tps (third person shooter) elements is a very interesting premise. If you haven't bought this yet, DO IT. Buy it now! This seriously has the potential to be my Game of the year if it continues to be this good (~8 hours in) . Pretty annoyed that i missed it's ps3 release (played the demo but didn't find it in stores..) Thanks for a great port, If you are not a fan of the anime style i still think you should give it a try!   One small thing that might annoy some people is the fact that the mouse doesn't work in menu's, i honestly didn't care and it worked perfectly fine wiht keyboard only."
"I have So far played only the first few Missions But, If You want a Decent Japanese Game, This would have to be it, From the Very begining You find Yourself Totally Emersed in the game, The Art Style only helps to Bolster that feeling of Emersion, 10 out of 10."
"My feelings about this game are two extremes. On one hand, it is a well designed, challenging, and thought out approach to turn based tactics the likes of which is rare to come by. Now this part talking about the good parts of the game is short, not because there are few good parts, but just because the good parts are satisfying, well made, and Just Work.  On the other, it's a game full of frustrating points, such as the sickly sweet voice acting, the moronic hackneyed plot, and the bizarre instant failures that happen during a battle. On far too many occasions have I been plodding my way meticulously through a battle, when the game spawns an anti-tank infantry right behind my main tank, which has a weak point the size of a house on the back of it that causes it to die instantly. And when the enemy shoots that big blue button on the back of the tank with their freshly spawned unit, it's game over. This kind of game design doesn't punish you for a mistake, this punishes you for not being psychic.  I've sworn at this game far more than I would like to, and the campaign went on well past its welcome. It's clearly a console port in terms of all the unlockables and etc. that add a superflous level of complexity that allows you to get the most out of your purchase. But I feel like these are unwelcome additions for a PC game.  Overall, it's a good game with a few horrendous flaws, and a few of the old console-centric play it to death design ideas. There are few games that do turn based tactical combat as well as this, but there are so many games that are much less needlessly frustrating. Buy it or don't."
solid porterino from the ps3 noice soundtrack 10/10 unit responses 
"For the longest time I wanted to get this game for ps3, and for the longest time the amount of copies in circulation was so small, that even a used copy of the game would cost $50+. Everyone who had played it, loved it. Now, since being a few hours or so into the game, I can say I feel the same way.  I played VC2 for psp first, and really liked it. The art style was great, the combat was both different and nice, and the game being set in the early-mid 1900's was a refreshing change from the norm, which is typically more medieval or futuristic settings. Both of those have been done so many times over lately.  Sega did a really good job with this port for sure. Graphics got a nice tune-up with high resolutions and AA. Cinematics however didn't get any work done on them, so there is some jagginess, but nothing deal-breaking. Controller support is obviously a nice bonus. Since it was a console title to begin with, having controller support is definitely nice. I also haven't encountered any bugs or crashes either. There might be some, but I have yet to encounter any. They also included the option to use the japanese VA instead of the english ones if you prefer.  You also get all of the DLC with the game, which apparently adds even more to the overall story (haven't touched any of it yet myself), and adds many more hours of gametime.  All in all, so far I rate it 8.5/10.  Cons:  -cutscene jagginess -lots of cutscenes (sometimes you'll have to play through 5+ minutes of cutscenes to get to the next battle) -making me wait this long to finally play it on PC ;)  Pros: -plenty of game to be had with DLC, and replayable skirmishes -nice art direction, giving it a different feel compared to other games -able to run the game on high settings with a weaker video card -no glitches/bugs so far -storyline so far is good. Thought it would be kind of japanese-o cheesy since it's a Jrpg, but it's surprisingly got me at times with some harsh moments in game  In summary: If you've been waiting a while to get this game, and are on the fence since your'e unsure how well it's been ported, just get the game already. It's shaping up to be better than the ps3 release from what I'm seeing. The price-point is fair IMO, and hopefully if enough people buy, maybe they'll start porting other VC titles to PC as well."
"The Japanese cartoon-mode of storytelling is no more annoying than that of the CoD, BF, or MoH-series."
"This game is very good, and here's why: 1. anime based art - many cute gals! 2. unique tactical game - combine tactical aspect with 3rd person shooter 3. good story and narrative - just like reading a good manga with a very good graphics  The only bad thing for this game is the rank system. After you finish a stage they will give you a rank based on the amount of turn taken. I think it's bad because they value you more when you just control one people and running to the goal than control your troops tactically and wipe all the enemy flawlessly. But you could ignore this rank system because rank just affects the amount of exp and money given, which you can get by grinding in skirmish system. At the end you can also replay all the stage so you can aim for the A rank later. Just play with your style and this game will be really fun."
Great game
X-Com meets JRPG with plenty of story filler
"If you like XCOM, you'll probably like this game. On your turn, you use Command Points(CP) to move units, call for reinforcements, or use special abilities (Orders). When you use a CP on a unit, you take over the unit in a 3rd person view and move them to wherever you like. You can only use a weapon once when controlling the unit, and any enemy units in range will fire upon your unit if they see it. Don't worry, your units shall do the same when it's the enemy's turn. The battles can be long, depending on your playstyle.  Just play it. I can't really explain it. I'm a little intoxicated. nO I'm not"
"beautiful gameplay, amazing art, great story(although WW2 esque cliche, which i like anyway), and fun challenege. I recommend this to anyone who likes story based games, RTS/Turn based strategy games, or both.  IGN - 11/10 story made me cry, because of reasons."
BEST.GAME.EVER there nothing else to say
"Well done PC port. The controls with mouse and keyboard are functional and in no way prevent or hinder gameplay. Graphical options are minimal but serviceable - vsync and resolution options. No anti-aliasing or the like, but the game's graphics preclude these items.   The gameplay is a mash-up of turn-based tactics with real-time movement. For example, choosing a character from the map screen to move drops you down into the battlefield where you move the character as you wish, limited by Action Points. These deplete as you move. If you cross an enemy's line of sight they will open fire on you and will continue to do so until you either end that character's turn or enter Targeting Mode, which allows you to shoot or use items from your inventory.  Well done gameplay and good PC controls. It's inexpensive for the quality of product. I'd highly recommend it."
use ps3 controller for this pc port. 11/10
Awesome port of an awesome game.
A MUST BUY  do you like XCOM? than you will probably love this game.
"Just as good as it was on PS3 which is to say amazing. Hands down, my favorite PS3 game. having it on PC is just sweet."
"Wanted this for years on console but was way to much money, even a used copy. Now I can get it cheap, kick back with my controller and play some cool JRPG war strategy!   The art, the story, the strategy, the characters, etc all make this an amazing game! The only downside is if people find the fights to challenging, but to me the fun is finding a way to win."
"Easily one of my favorite games from last generation, and certainly in my top 10 ever. This game is a blast!"
"Fun Game! Some of the dialogue is hamfisted, but what can you expect? The art direction is fantastic, the story is intriguing, and the gameplay is addicting. Pretty solid port although there is an issue with high fps causing tanks to go slowly."
What can I say? It's amazing. Play it for yourself.
Good game! Though I have some issues where it uses integrated graphics instead of my nvidia gpu but can be easily configured manually through nvidia control panel. Easily 10/10
"Ok, just getting into the game on a suggestion of a friend. He was right the game is fun but that's not why I'm recommending the game. Rather than needing to deal with WASD or arrow keys for aiming and looking around. Nope. In game you can use your mouse to look around. Why is it so damn difficult to get companies that do ports to allow some mouse usage? Would I prefer that you allow it in the menus? Yes, but I don't care I spent a good 20 minutes in the first few fights just looking around... and getting shot at... but looking around. 10/10 will buy the second installment.... there is a second installment out / coming out.... right?"
"Excellent port, graphics quality is arguably better than even that offered by the PS3, gameplay is smooth and well translated. My only complaint is that the game lacks an auto-save feature, not game-breaking, but definitely an extra thing to have to keep an eye on.   I highly recommend the port to any newcomers to the series, as I am sure they will appreciate Valkyria Chronicles in the clean and friendly PC format. Veterans should appreciate the reboot as well as it stays faithful to the original without skipping a beat."
"Its VC, best PS3 game of all time. Now with better res and fps"
"I highly recommend this game.  -Beautiful and interesting art style.  -Good Enlgish voice actors. (And the ability to have Japanese voice actors)  -Well executed RPG mechanics. (In my opinion)  -Excelent turn-based combat system with a nice sprinkle of shooter mechanics.  I have to say that this is a fun game to play. And you're hearing this from a guy who doesn't really like strategy games.  Also, supposedly this game will run on low-end computers well."
"I am not the kind of person who drops $20 easily—this game is an exception. I have wanted to play it for a long time, so when it came out on the PC the purchase was a no brainer. This is one of my favorite strategy games.  —If you enjoy turn based strategy then you will love this game. There is a third person shooting element too, so gameplay requires both strategy and tactics.  —Emersion into the alternate WWII world is great. I enjoy the story which unfolds through gameplay, plenty of excellent cutscenes, and sometimes reading.   —There is pleanty to do after battles like customize tanks, learn new special abilities, and level up your troops.   P.S. If your a perfectionist redoing missions and saving/loading will happen frequently. It's a lot more fun to do missions the first time than the second, third, or fourth time. The opperation of tanks can be tricky at times with a mouse, but I like the challenge too. Nevertheless. this is an awesome game which I recomend."
"Played and loved this game on PS3. Absoluely love the port to PC, SEGA really put their time into converting it over.   not the best at 4K, but does a damn good job trying."
A unique game. I always hesitated to purchase this when I had a PS3 but Im so glad they ported it over to PC or I would've missed out on this gem. I hope they bring VC II &amp; III onto Steam\PC as well.
"I actually thought I was dreaming when I heard one of my favorite games of all time was being ported to PC after six years. Thank goodness its an actually good port that allows you to edit inputs and have a resolution higher than 720p, because its rare for any Japanese game's port to have those features.  For those who have not played Valkyria Chronicles before, VC is a turn based strategy games that allows free movement for every character. So instead of moving on a grid your character has an energy bar, and that bar goes down as the character moves, and once its empty you need to either use a command or end the turn for that character.  The art style is obviously anime (the lead artist worked on hentai manga before this), but is never 'too anime' so you won't get the shounen-tier big hair or the Nomura esque stupid clothing.  The story itself is just okay and the soundtrack is remenicient of any WWII movie.  Hopefully alot of players buy this, because I'd love to see SEGA continue the franchise"
"I have wet dreams about this game. I was shown this game by Demolition D, but now, it's my D being demolished."
This game is Amazing! I bought it for the PS3 a while back and never really played it thought I would try it again on the PC when I heard it was getting released and it got me hooked!!! This game will bring your hours of enjoyment and gameplay!
"Great port to pc! Now I can get rid of my ps3, as this game was the only reason I was keeping it."
"Holy hell, this game can run on my toaster #IntelHDgraphicspentiumGCrew"
"Engaging gameplay, an entertaining story and a superb port to pc. You can sink hours into this game. Highly recommended."
I HAVE A HOMOSEXUAL MAN IN MY SQUAD AND WEARS MAKE UP  10/10
A must have!
"At first I was unsure about this game but as you get past the first tutorial-like hurdles in the game, it can pick up and pique your interest more, I find that from my playing experience so far, it uses good game mechanics in it's turn based strategy and includes a great storyline - I would reccomend this to anyone who loves squad-based TBS' and/or is a fan of storylines. However it could be better in the sense that you dont use the mouse at all in game and rely purely on the keyboad but this is easy to adapt to."
This was the first game I've purchased at full retail price since the disapointment that was Dark Souls 2. Well worth the money.   Buy/5 IGN
Turn based strategy at its best.
"X-Com meets JRPG meets World War 2?  I'm in! A really good turn based tactical combat game with an interesting diesel punk WWII setting in an alternate 'Europa' the Valkyria chronicles is a good game with an interesting art style. The beautiful water colour graphics may not to be everyones taste but they've grown on me and I like them.  Only played a few hours at writing this but so far so good, 8/10"
"First of all I'd like to say I played Valkyria Chronicles when it first cam out on PS3 and loved it. It transfers over to a keyboard and mouse remarkable well with only 1 control issue that is easily worked around and otherwise 2 mere issues that should be able to be fixed with updates.  The control issue that I mentioned is only present when controlling either of the 2 tanks. While with your soldiers the mouse is simply a great way to look around the surroundings and move the screen for some reason the tank wants to rotate with the screen. With would not be a problem but that rotation counts against your movement on each turn. This can be avoided easily enough by simply using the number pad and turning the screen with 8,4,6,2. I only suggest this when using the tank though as with the soldiers being able to make the finer screen adjustments with the mouse is far more effective.  The larger of the 2 other issue I mention involve going back to the episode select of the book from the HQ. It happend 3 times in a row on me that the game will freeze on the load screen if you try to transition to fast. The last few times I've done it though as long as you wait about 5 seconds before confirming there has not been a problem.  Lastly the voices get a little distorted every now and then during cutscenes. Still able to understand them, there is just a rare line that has some static or sounds like it was delivered to far from the mic.  Really love this game and only due to the minor bugs do I give it a 8.5/10"
I loved the story of the game. I fell in love with all of the characters.  Can't wait for the second game to come onto steam.
"What isn't there to like about this game? In my opinion, nothing.  -Engaging story -Excellent character development -Very fun fast paced gameplay -Tons of replay value   This game is an absolute masterpiece! I played it for PS3 and still have that copy of it. Bought this one for achievements and in hope of porting the other games to PC if it recieves good sales Do yourself a favor and BUY IT And then hope and pray that they localize and port the other two games to PC "
"Where do you start with a brilliant yet weird title like Valkyria Chronicles? This game is freaking gorgeous, that’s where. VC plants you into the story of a militia squad in a very Japanese fantasy loosely based on WW2. The art direction is absolutely beautiful, part Hayao Miyazak film part watercolour painting. You’ll see the story unfold in episodes (which are completely non-playable) and in battles. You’re also able to head to the HQ page where lots of the rpg elements, such as levelling up units, upgrading weapons and so on come into play. As unlikely as it sounds, this simple formula works a treat.  You’ll spend most of your time in combat. You choose your squad (all of which have individual personalities, perks and disadvantages) and send them into turn-based battles. In combat the game takes a novel and less punishing spin on the XCOM games; rather than isometric, you control each individual unit in 3rd person and must aim manually. It takes a bit of getting used to, but I quickly fell in love with it. In fact, controlling from 3rd person makes the battles very personal tense as you never really have a clear view of what’s going on, and enemies can and will be hiding round ever corner. While it starts out REALLY slowly, you’ll soon be facing down hordes of enemy tanks, blasting enemies with your flame thrower weilding storm troopers and setting up ambushes while carefully avoiding mines and sniper fire. It is not too difficult, but it is really enjoyable. Although there is permadeath, you can evacuate wounded soldiers, and all units have first aid kits. In fact I made it through the game without anyone dying. Also, your units types (scout, lacer, storm trooper, engineer, sniper) level up as a whole rather than as individuals, so even if you did lose your favourite sniper it wouldn’t affect your chances too much, unlike XCOM where losing your A team is disastrous.  It is not perfect though. Although the art style is superb, there’s no hiding the fact that this is a 2009 console game, and it looks like it. Also, there were a lot minor frustrations in combat such as getting stuck on corners and in bits of scenery (while being gunned down furiously) or silly little things like being blocked in by other soldiers or not being able to climb down a ladder coz someone else was to close to the bottom of it. Also, the game has a staggering number of upgrades for your tank, but they start being redundant about half way through the game  Overall, I fell head over heels for VC. The spectacular art style, the cheesy JRPG imagined WW2, the steam punk/ Hayao Miyazak tanks, the cute story, the thrilling combat... it all just comes together to be more than the sum of its parts. Season PC RPGers might find this a bit too cutesy and lite, but anyone who likes JRPGs and turn-based battles should check this out. I've already clock up 50 hours, and I'll probably play through NG+ at some point too, plus the steam edition comes with all the DLC from the playsation original, so it is good bang for your buck, as they say.   P.s. if you ever played Skies of Arcadia you are in for some nice surprises ! "
This is Such a Great Game Such a Great stroy Good Gameplay This Game was made Fantastic 10/10
Great turn base strategy game. The story and soundtrack is great and really stands out amongst other games in its genre. You control a squad of characters that you get to pick that can be customize and gain special abilities through experience. Gameplay mechanics is kinda similar to XCOM which was influence by Valkryia Chronicles. Your given a number of command points to use on your character in order to control them.
"Pretty good; nice little story, interesting take on turn-based strategy, good voice over, dialog not anime-translator-ridiculous but surprisingly reasonable, good length game, and reasonably priced. Not generally a fan of games out of Japan nor ported from console, but this game has none of the downsides of those things. I'd probably play the sequels if they were in English too and on PC."
"The unique gamplay of this game is what intrigued me enough to buy it, and man I really loved it. Great gameplay and story. Not to mention it's a ton of game hours if you get to all the extras and bonus content (which I haven't yet). I highly recommend this game."
You want to play xcom but in the same time you also want to watch anime? Well you should play this game
"Ran my team mate over and knocked him into some grass, no damage. He has a pollen allergy, his turn never came. 10/10"
"A lost gem of a game released in the early days PS3. Valkyria Chronicles is an excellent JRPG, with a different take on the genres usual gameplay mechanics. By having light elements of a third-person shooter, tactical gameplay elements of a JRPG and the squad management of XCOM, it’s a fresh and new experience to anyone who has or haven’t played the genre. The game is packed full of hours of gameplay from the story missions, to the skirmishes, challenges and side missions, you’re bound to have a blast. Also talking about its story; the game is set within an alternate medieval/WWII era 1930's. Europe is divided into 2 super powers: the “Federation” and the “Empire”, both vying for control over a resource known as Ragnite. Tensions rise and soon a Second World War (or Second Europan war in this case), erupts and a small neutral country called “Galia”, is caught in the middle. From there you play as Welkin; a young man who has been drafted into the state's militia who is tasked to form a ragtag team of anime G.I. Joes to fight off the invasion of the all mighty Empire. What’s not to like about that premise? Also I like to point out the games graphics which uses a watercolour render which gives the game the look of a beautiful water brushed painting, which in my opinion is “F***ing tasty”. I highly recommend this game for those who want something fresh and new, and those who are fans of JRPGS or those who are looking to get into the genre. Well what are you waiting for? Go buy it!!! Give them money so they can make a sequel that's not a PSP exclusive!"
 A Story better than most Anime &amp; Movies
Holy crap. This is one of the best turn-based strategy games I've ever played; and they are nowhere near my favorite in terms of genre.   In a way feels like Advance Wars meets Company of Heroes; really good stuff here.
"Really good turn base strategy game with action element. Like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of XCOM and AdvanceWar but less good than his parents. i find the strategy element lacking a little bit though but its still challenging. No bugs except once where my soldier fell trough the map in one mission. took me a long time (20h+) to finish it, so for the price tag, its really a good deal."
"When i saw that this game was on Steam, I knew i wanted it. Played it on PS3 and loved it. Never got a chance to beat it either but now i do. One of the great few turned based strategy games even."
A surprisingly charming tactical RPG.
"Honestly, one of the best games and storylines I have played through in a long time. I missed playing it on the PS3 (went the 360 route), so this was my first chance to play this little gem. I thoroughly enjoyed the game, even with some of the quirks in regard to the port. The animation was absoutely amazing."
"Valkyria Chronicles is an excellent game with compelling story,gameplay and visuals.  The characters are each enjoyable in their own way as is the main storyline.  To add to this each character has their own reasons for fighting and quirks which you will learn by using them in missions.  The score is lacking in parts with a lot of the soundtrack being heard repeatedly but the music that is in the soundtrack is well produced and always fits the scene.  The inclusion of Japanese voices is to be noted , although the English voices are incredible.  For the cheap price point and the inclusion of all the dlc on steam, not to mention running at 60fps and 1080p in comparison to it's counterpart on PS3 Valkyria Chronicles on PC is definitly a must buy for any fans of Turn based strategy or RPG genre games.     twitch.tv/deppresso   @deppresso on twitter"
"Very nice Round Based Strategy Game.  The game is based on a simple scissors paper stone concept to win the battles. But it is still a bit challenging because of the targets and you need to plan ahead. The difficullty is higher then the 2. game of the series but overall it is fair.  The Story is nice and it has alote of lovely Characters, but if you saw already the Anime you will not find much new inside beside some more Details to the characters and places.   But here is als a small downside, because before you can start a new mission you need to see alote of the Story plots/clips. If you don`t like to see such things always it can be a bit frustrating. In general you need to watch 5-8 story clips before you can start the next mission. For me it is ok but for some people maybe dont like it.  The Grafik is based on an Anime Artconcept, if you like Animes you for sure will like the Style.  Sound and Voice acting are good and matching if you don`t like the english voice you can also change to the orginal japanese voice.  If you try it your self and also like the game i also can recommend you to watch the Anime or play the game Valkyria Chronicles 2 for PSP it has basically the same concept and art design like the first game but new characters and story.  For me I have played the PSP title first and buy the first title after I saw it on Steam because it was early just a PS3 title."
"Valkyria Chronicles offers a mix between a third-person shooter, a turn-based strategy game (some liken it to XCOM, though it is quite different), and an Anime TV show. Now, if you're not into Anime, don't worry, because it's easily looked past when you focus on what really makes the game: the gameplay and the story.  The story is told through the game's 'Book Mode', from which you can select chapters that allow you to watch 'episodes' and play missions (Operations), or go to the HQ to outfit your unit, or even check out information on squad members, weapons, enemies, etc. in the game. I was a big fan of the mix between gameplay and the episodes as they were very well done, though my only complaint is that the cutscenes (episodes) were rendered at 1280x700 resolution (no doubt for the game's original platform: the PS3). Music and voice-acting as well as all the visuals are really well done in them (absolutely LOVE the aesthetic!).  The gameplay (in the form of operations/missions) is relatively straightforward: you deploy your units, then from a top-down view of the field you select a unit you wish to use (soliders cost 1 Command Point and tanks 2). This then switches you to a third-person perspective of that unit, allowing you to move them around with standard WASD+mouse controls. Now you may be wondering why you can control units in real-time when it is a turn-based game, right? Well, whilst controlling a unit, all other units stay still, but if you are not in target mode but are in range of an enemy, they will shoot you, so be careful. Going in to target mode, though, will pause everything, allowing you to shoot, heal, and more. Moving will take up Action Points (displayed in a meter), so making sure you move your unit back into cover after firing is usually a good idea :)  I did find the game difficult, and overall Steam says I have put 27 hours into the game. However, I did die a bit and had to reload to previous saves, which brings me to my second complaint about the game: the absence of auto-save functionality. The manual saves do work, but unfortunately there is only one save slot. So if you override a save and then mess up, your only option may be to just restart the operation again. Gladly, I made a habit of saving cautiously throughout, so it wasn't long before I was on top of the system.  But that's all I really have to say about the game. It's a load of fun, the story is great and gets your really involved, and the game's art style just looks fantastic! There's more fun to be found in the 'Skirmish Mode' (allowing you to gain more XP and money to train units and buy weapons/upgrades outside of the Story Mode) and, once your finished, there is a 'New Game Plus'-type mode, allowing you to keep all units and weapons etc. from your previous playthrough. I highly recommend playing this if you're a fan of Anime, third-person shooters or turn-based games - you will not regret it!  Enjoy! :D"
"I enjoy this game, are there things I would change? Sure. But the fun factor is there. its a story interupted by a battle scene once a chapter. If you dont like Anime/Story games/turn based action, then skip this one. If you do like those then buy it!! I like the Anime style charaters and scenes. Its a game I will play over and over, till the next one comes out, if there will be a next one. Usally games I like always seem to dead end after the first one, my luck I guess.... Enjoy this game."
"Fantastic game, now one of my all time favorites. Strong story telling and a rich world set the stage for challenging and unique turn based tactical battles. The mechanics take a little getting used to but are both immersive and lead to innovative tactical play. The characters are wonderful, charming, and have more depth than usual for games of this genre. Dialog can be clunky at time and the vilians are mostly stock characters, but there is real mastery in the pacing and ploting of the story contrasting good hearted people against the cruelty of war.  Bottom line is, if you like turn based games, you must try this one."
"There is a lot of good things a can say about this game...  But I'll try to make it short:  This game is great!!!  A rare example of not just a game but an artwork...  Story, music, gameplay...  For me this game stands on the same level as Final Fantasy VII, VIII... or Dragon Age...  Great work developers!  Looking forward for your new creations!"
"This game gave me a huge meaning in my life. It was not the war, It was a sincere display of Solidarity of this game that made me feel warm in my heart. After a long time of watching the gameplay and walkthrough, it came back, on Steam, which made me so overjoyed that I can finally play this game on PC. It was like a forgotten angel in the heavens we have almost forgot, have come back. Thank you.  My rating for this game is: 10/10  'The best game I've ever played in my life'"
"This game I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a great story, amazing art and music, and lovable characters. The gameplay consists of 2 sections; Placing and moving your units, and attacking. It is similar to Fire Emblem or Advanced Wars for the unit placing section, and a bit like a 3rd Person Shooter while moving. The units all have a different personality which plays into their abilities and usefulness. Different characters are effective in different situations. The game can be challenging to some, but it is easy to learn. I love this game, and recommend it to all types of players."
This a great RPG. It kinda mixes 3rd person shooters´ camera and turn based RPG and the result is a nice and very enjoyable game.
"Gameplay: 9/10 - Imagine mixing Squaresoft and X-Com together. This is also one of the rarer games that get better as the story progress. Everything's polished and is a joy to play.  Graphic: 9/10 - Nice visual and artwork.  Storyline: 8.5/10 - Like the Darcsen being prosecuted part.  Replayibility: 9/10 - Trying to get the 'A' ranked and get the $$$ and experience.  Overall: 9/10 The best thing about this game is the longevity. After clocking in more than 35 hours and just when you thought everything is over after you defeat Selvaria... bam comes Jaeger and then Maximillian. And as mentioned before, this game is a joy to play unlike most other game where I'm hoping to finish fast. This one, I'm hoping it'll drag even more and it did.       "
10/10 You will be cry like little kid when these imperial ♥♥♥♥♥♥s kill your favourite character.
Awesome Game and a much more awesome Story
"tl;dr Awesome game from which you'll get out most if you enjoy stories of the games and can yourself take a roleplaying approach (roleplaying doesn't mean savescumming to the 99 lvl). Even if you don't enjoy roleplaying or stories, it's still quite awesome.  It was really worth anticipating the whole year 2014. For me Valkyria Chronicles was much bigger thing than most of the western AAA games I have played in last three years. The original game is somewhat old (2008) but it still feels very fresh also the PC port is quite well done. Huge plus for the game is that the original japanese voice acting is included as alternative – something that should be with every non-english game.  About the game: The game's genre is somewhat difficult to define and Valkyria Chronicles propably turns out to be different from what the player has anticipated. The game isn't jrpg or strategy, that's just half of the deal. The other half is a visual novel. Actually the interface of the game is a scrapbook where one chapter is spread in two pages. Getting into next chapter is achieved by 'watching' the pictures in the book (watching cut scenes) and fighting (most often) one battle in every chapter. This may mean ankward situation to those who always keep pressing start button in every game when cut scene occurs.  Because the form of the game has lot emphasis on the story, the story should also be treated in a review? Well... The story itself isn't much special, it's somewhat mediocre anime plot. There is boy and a girl and they join in army (militia) and at the end of the war they (well, you'll probably guess). In addition every anime cliche is included. The romance of Alicia and Welkin... oops spoilers... left me quite cold and as characters such, they are somewhat lukewarm. Parts where other (side) characters take part in the plot are much more interesting and minions of the Evil Empire could have had even bigger part, where their person could have been depicted much more properly and their motives could have been explained in a more detailed way. The plot in itself isn't that great but the way it is told felt somehow special. I don't usually pay any attention to the graphics but here their unique and vibrant style awakens the story to life. Also spending quite much time in a mission between two scenes helps attaining somewhat personal commitment to the story, plus it rhytms the storytelling nicely.  So what about the other part, the missions? To be honest, here are some problems. The biggest problem propably will be the the player (in my case it was). I suffer from the very common savescumming syndrome (which is very well known from XCOM). The game has 50 possible squad members, which are unique and which may suffer permanent death. Permanent death means getting shot down to zero hp and then have enemy run over. The game can be saved before mission start and in missions between player's own movements. It's easy to see why player may result saving and loading the game constantly. This tendency for safe life will unfortunately partially diminish the story elements. In the first playthrough missions aren't replayable because it focuses on telling the story. Also the some missions themselves have some kind of suprprise story elements, like 'enemy gets' overpowered reinforcements, which can't be properly anticipated and which therefore propably result to dying squad members and loading the game few turns earlier. Another thing that results save loading is grading the missions. Better grade means more exp and money. For some hard-to-grasp reasons someone had thought this great idea that the grading should be based only on speed, not on casualties or mission performance. In practice this means that running into crossfire and save-loading results rank A with double awards. Also the game introduces 'order mechanic' (using movement points to buff characters) which isn't quite balanced and can be used with certain combinations for buffing invulnerable characters and achieving instant win. So the player might need some self discipline here, because 2 min story missions aren't really fun considering the overall game experience. The first playthrough would be much better if grading and in mission saving were disabled. So for all the potential buyers who'll read this review and get the game: Take care of your squad, not ranks and instead of savescumming rather shed some tears for your Aisha Neumann, who panicked in front of enemy and died. You'll always get a new chance in new game+.  And about the new game+. Completing the game took me about 40 hours and for getting all the achievements I spent another 40 hours in NG+. So what more is there besides the core game? Mostly DLC (that are automatically included in the Steam version), the best dlc I have ever played. There are four of them all in all. Two of them are story based:  - Behind Her Blue Flame lets you play on enemy's side and command Selvaria, a Valkyrie that you'll surely learn to hate in the main game and this dlc flashes another side of the story. The dlc consist on four missions in two maps that are familiar from the main game. The story side is quite thin, but playing as Valkyrie with machine gun and as proper valkyrie is great and ridiculously fun addition to the main game. - Edy's mission lets you command everyone's favourite girl Edy Nelson and her closest friends when they (quite surprisingly) carry out a heroic deed. The mission reuses a map from the main game and the is in itself is quite badly implemented. The main focus of the dlc is act as comic relief and such it works quite well if the main game doesn't leave cold.  The two non-story-based dlc make additions to the main game's skirmish. The main game is needed to be completed atleast for another of them. I found another of these dlc on coincidence, because the scrapbook doesn't really inform when there are additional pages to be turned. But about the skirmish dlc: - Edy's challenges add skenarios for each character class where the particular class is needed in a form or another. The missions resemble some kind of tutorials but the difficulty is much higher than in the main game and actually some very high level weapons are to be found in the skenarios. The missions aren't the best the game can offer but considerable challenge and the personalities of the Edy's group make them a delight. - Last, but not least, a dlc adds new difficulties hard and expert to game's skirmish maps. This is something that changes the game's character totally. No story, only extremely brutal challenges where some serious tactics, luck (and much much save-loading) is needed. The only difference, compared to the normal difficulty, isn't just enemy's weapons that do more than 10 times damage and status effects. Player and enemy troop placement is also altered and offence from east to west instead of west to east really forces changes in tactics, not to mention cases where own squad is spreaded here and there. In some maps enemy mortar fire is added and so on. Expert mode also removes player tank, which also mitigates the possibility of player abusing the order mechanic.  All in all: a game with a huge story to tell, where is plenty to be played and all this is presented with a big heart."
"This game. What can I even say? Well, it has both good gameplay and a good story. In fact, the story made me cry a bit. God I love this game."
"Fantastic game! wonderful story! the game mechanics are a little clunky at times, but it is a minor thing in the grand scheme of things. I hope they port the other games. I WANT MORE!!!!"
Very good story and excellent tactics gameplay.
Love this game. I just wish they would release VC3 in the US. Can't wait to get all of the achievements
"You know, I hate consoles for the most part but this was one of the few games that ever caused me to pick up a PS3 controller. All the wonderfullness that is Valkyria Chronicles but now moved to Steam for us to enjoy. There aren't any flaws really, not unless you simply hate the combat/strategy system. The ranking of missions is based on how many turns you take to win though, and that's unrealistic, Selvaria's Last Stand can be won in two turns unrealistically by scout rush and the Unlock Potential order. Regardless of what you've heard of this game, It has a unique gameplay system that all gamers should at least experience, whether you love it or hate it this game is one of the most unique combinations of RTS, Turn-Based Tactics, and a shooting game that you might ever find. Seriousness aside because of this game whenever my friends get disconnected in games we play I often say 'Man down everybody be careful.' which is a direct line from the game when your squad kills enemies."
WHIMSICAL ANIME WWDEUX
A game nicely made and ported. Surely recommanded.
"Having never bought into the console hype of the past few years, I wasn't sure what I was going to expect from Valkyria Chronicles. Sure, I've read the odd review here and there from about seven years ago when a few mates floated the title around during conversation, but I was initially concerned that the recently-released PC port on Steam would not work out, or that I might be disappointed with a lack-luster or personally underwhelming title.  After about 40 or more hours of solid game-time to date, not only were my initial impressions wrong, they were completely blown out of the water.   While many of the game's positives have likely already been pointed out by other reviews here, the game's engrossing strategic/tactical gameplay, excellent visuals and entertaining (if not occasionally grim, for those who pick up on the parrallels to the last World War right off the bat) story are certainly highlights that I can attest to. The addition of all released DLC for the game - including a few missions as the opposing side during the opening shots of their invasion - have been the icing on the cake.  If there were any problems with any aspect of the game that I may have had so far, then my main one would have to be with a minor point with the control interface. Namely, trying to steer a tank - AP points being chewed up by the second - while my mouse (which ALSO pivots the tank) keeps throwing fits; if I don't stop-start constantly, this sends my tank careening all over the place. While not constant enough to throw me completely off the game, it is a source of annoyance and has caused me to, more then once, lose a battle after an enemy Lancer puts a AT warhead up my now-exposed tank's ragnite reactor. Hopefully, a re-examination and adjustment of my control set-up could mitigate any self inflicted 'traffic jams' in future.  All the above aside, Valkyria Chronicles has been an absolute blast for me to date. This is a PC port I would highly recommend for fans of SRP/RTS games, even for only one solid playthrough.   So what are you waiting for, recruit? Grab your rifle and get out there!"
"If you like tactical thinking and turn-based strategy with enemy action, much in the vein of XCOM, then this game is right up your alley."
"A neat little turn based shooting tactics game. Beating the hardest levels in time to get an A ranking is pretty tough, but satisfying. There are a few minor flaws with the controls (mostly on tanks), but nothing unforgivable. I'd say an 8/10."
"Captivating story. Original design. Unique style. A testament to Sega's legacy that other games should look up to. If you never got the chance to play the original PS3 version, or would like to revisit a classic I couldn't recommend this any more highly. Truly a magnificent experience."
"Well fleshed out story and fun stratigic gameplay, AI is a little weak, but leval design more than makes up for it. game is centered around the story rather than the missions. highly recomend for anyone that likes games with strong story."
"X-com style gameplay with an amazing story, great game, and for this price it is definitly worth it!"
I am so surprised by how addicitive and enjoyable this game is. It took a little to get into but once the initial training missions are done there is so much depth and tactics in this game Loving it
Recommended to people who like this type of game.  Note: the game doesn't autosave! And the game crashes. So you will lose a lot of progress if it crashes and you haven't saved.
"Ahh, for me this is already a fantastic game. I haven't played it for too long, but I plan on completing it for absolute certain. I haven't been much into JRPGs until recently. I like the cinematics a lot. If you don't like cinematics and you JUST want gameplay, I'm not sure if I would advise this game. But this game is definitely deep. I like the story in this game. I also love the fact that there are profiles on a lot of characters. As I said, I'm not too far into it, but I think that I got my money's worth already. I'm looking forward to seeing what the rest of the game is like! I'll update this review whenever I finish the game and as I go on, for now, it's a good review!  There's so much about this game that is worth it.  +The combat system is unique +Wealth of lore in-game +Unique backstory for each character +Upgrade system is excellent, for weapons, tanks and everything +Hours and Hours of gameplay  I haven't seen many drawbacks thus far. I might say some when I get to them, but I hate to be negative when it comes to games, because games are fun. Do your research before playing this game! Don't buy it on a whim. I love this game so far, though. I'd recommend taking a look into it. Enjoy!"
"Good TBS with nice setting. The controls are a bit wonky, tank driving especially, but once you adjust it's not a big problem."
Fantastic strategy game. I am not a fan of anime whatsoever but this game does a great job with story and gameplay. Worth a try for anyone that likes strategy games. Similar to Xcom
"The gameplay is a lot of fun. Similar to FF Tactics, so if you like that you'll like this. it's basically all battles though and they can go on for a long time. I had an error that made characters move really slowly which added time. Story isn't that great and the lack of any exploration or overworld makes it feel a bit claustriphobic.   Protip: I did not realize that when it is your turn you can save your game in battle! A couple nights I stayed up late feeling like I had to finish the battle, so don't make that mistake."
It is a great tatics game.
"Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing strategy game. However there are many other genres at work here as well. You can call this game a hybrid between a strategy game, a third person shooter, a visual novel and an RPG.  And the great part about this game is that it does not sacrifice the depth of one genre for the sake of another.They come together beautifully to form a really great experience.They also made a great choice with the art style, this is a game from 2008 and it looks just as good now as it did back then. The game looks good in all aspects of gameplay, the map overview, in third person, in visual novel parts and in the squad management screens.  What really hits home for me as well is the squad management aspect of the game. This includes everything from upgrading your weapons and armour, upgrading your tanks, ranking up your classes to managing who actually gets into your squad based on their traits and who they play best with. It's a deep system and it's really satisfying putting all the pieces into place before heading off into battle.  Most of the time you will be spending either following the story or doing the actual battles. The story is delivered as a visual novel (fully voice acted) or in cutscenes (although not as often), and it is intelligent enough to present to you the different points of view of the characters on opposing sides and interesting enough to hold your attention throughout. The battle system is probably where the game really shines, it is divided into two parts. First you have the map overview where you have represented everyone in your squad and every enemy they can see, from here you select one of your characters and you are switched to the second part. The third person action section, where you manually move the characters and aim their shots. You can take your time here as well, just be careful not to do it in front of an enemy as they will shoot at you if you enter their view cone.  Once in battle you have the option of controlling a tank or an infantry fighter from the 5 different classes in the game (scout, assault, lancer, engineer and sniper). Each of them have their own roles and usefulness, however I will say that some of the classes become less and less useful as the story progress. This is especially true for the sniper, as their very limited amount of action points means that you will not be able to effectively use them past the first few turns of the battle (and also the levels are designed so that there aren't many levels with completely open fields, there is always something in the way, or the enemies hunkered down and at that point a sniper can not one shot kill them even with a headshot). To a lesser extent this is also true for the lancers, as their primary role of being anti tank fighters is done just well by the actual tanks in your possession, and their similarly low amount of AP means that they're not that good at sneaking behind the enemy and shooting at the weak spots. The assault class can do this just as well, if you buff them they can take down a tank by shooting at their weak spot in one turn even, and on top of that they can retaliate on the enemy infantry (which the lancers can not, as they only have an anti tank weapon). As time goes on you will see what is truly useful to you and the great part is that you can build a squad however you want, there are only a few characters that you can not switch out of a squad going into battle.  The biggest drawback is that everything just moves too slowly in the game. When you're in a position where you just want to move up all of your guys, you have no choice but to manually take control of each of them and slowly run forward and in the later stages of the game that means moving 10 characters each turn. It can get annoying fast, but thankfully there aren't too many of those instances as usually you will have at least someone to fight along the way.  And there is something similar for the story part, if it's not an actual cutscene, then you have to manually move the text forward. I would like to just sit back and enjoy the story as it goes, but it becomes annoying having to press space after every single sentence, to the point that I stopped listening to the characters and just reading what they're saying and skipping as soon as I could. Definitely not the right way to enjoy the story, but they really should have put an option there to automatically skip once a character is done speaking.  I will also mention that the map overview section would really need some additional info displayed on it, things like effective range of your characters and the enemies, and view cones for all the characters. There has been too many times that I lost a character by entering the edge of the view cone of an enemy, this is difficulty by obfuscation not by clever design. And there are also other small annoyances which help keep the game from being truly amazing.  All in all Valkyria Chronicles is truly amazing, and the type of game that we're lucky to get on the PC. I remember seeing this game back in 2008 when it was released for the PS3 and just knowing that there is something special about it, I'm just happy to be able to play it now on the PC, even if it is almost a decade later. It is also packed with content, it will take you around 30 hours to finish the game, and then you can go on to new game plus or you can do some of the challenges.  8½ / 10"
"Like XCOM, but with cute girls."
I got free bread. 10/10 Would eat bread again.
"Wow. I always heard good things about this game but never got my hopes up. Its amazing that a game originally released in 2008 could hold up by today's standards in every way. Who knew Sega was still capable of this? Unfortunately they didnt ride this wave the way they should have. If this released on 360 it would have sold even more copies outside of Japan. Thats obvious considering the steam release blew away their projected sales. And instead of going full out with the sequels, they downgraded to PSP which sealed the series fate outside of Japan. But if they had a team this talented, they could have given them any number of projects. Skies of Arcadia, Phantasy Star (single player not the mmo series), Shining Force (this would be the most intriguing imo considering the team already showed mastery of the tactical genre) and maybe even Panzer Dragoon Saga. Sega has a rich history of RPGs that fans have been begging to see return. Instead, they continually run themselves into the ground. It pains me that one day Im going to wake up and read a flood of articles about how my beloved Sega had to close its doors... Hopefully Nintendo buys them out or merges with them and saves them from themselves."
JRPG isn't my thing but this game changed that.  9/10
"Fantastic story, fantastic gameplay. Highly recommend."
"Wanted to play something like Fire Emblem. 3DS was out of battery. Saw that this was on sale. Bought it, played it. This is some good shet."
A damn well amazing game! Nothing more needs to be said.
"IT'S A GOOD ♥♥♥♥ING GAME.  ♥♥♥♥ING BUY IT, JESUS.  My computer is pretty bad but even it can run this game with a decent framerate, and if you don't have a good computer go buy a ♥♥♥♥ing PS3 as Valkyria Chronicles 2 is out for it, and apparently a third one is on the way.   GOOD. ♥♥♥♥ING. GAME. ♥♥♥♥  "
"Bought VC on its PS3 launch day and loved it. Great story, unique gameplay and a wonderful art style make it a must play."
"It's like playing chess with shooting action. Battles are chalenging and hard, sometimes to the level that is frustrating, but failing and trying different strategy is a fun part of this game. Story-rich timeline with many side story that will keep you engaged with the main characters.  One of the best RPG/strategy game I've ever played."
"I loved almost everything about Valkyria Chronicles, but didn't like the bossfights. It makes me feel like I'm actually working with a local military force, and the people in it.  Seriously though, great game. Give it a go. Watch the Senjou no Valkyria anime while you're at it."
"Pro: good for anime/WW2 fans great third person tactical gameplay  con: Saving mechanics are not as well done (no autosave, and took me 30hrs of gameplay to find the multi save option)  Story is self-contracting and sometimes pointless (like a certain disney ending)  Scouts make things too easy mid-late game Orders can be overpowered (I killed a heavy tank with a submachine gun to the front hull just by shouting at a soldier)"
Buy it. Alicia is best waifu.
"4 Hours into the game, i'm having fun with it's challenging and hard turn base combat!  Plus your unit make a cute victory pose when they kill a enemy &lt;3  10/10"
In my top three games of all time. 10/10
Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best titles that Sega has made. It is truly a new type of expirience with its strategy mechanics and story book style story. I hope the 3rd one comes to PC as well since this has beena fun game to play through.

"I love this game. The animation style, the gameplay, and the storyline all come together to make a game that evokes the feeling of a blockbuster movie with the strategy and Role Playing you know and love. Thats not to say the game doesn't have its downsides, but the heart of the game is amazing.   Pros: -Amazing story- I have only jsut begun, but already I can't wait to continue the story and see how my team interacts, not to mention how the plot thickens!  - Rich gameplay- Not only do you have to select a team to fight for you, but each have their own quirks which really help to make the characters feel alive. You don't have troops that you throw away, there isn't any cannon fodder-like troop, and each man or woman you command brings a personality with them.   -Tactics- The game has a great tactical base, though it can be somewhat nonsensical at times. Sneaking up on an enemy trooper by being slightly to their right can be ridiculous, and crouching negating headshots is just silly. However the game does reward creativity and persistence with victory. Rushing your enemy is rarely a good idea, but splitting your team and hitting either side of their main force? Hell yeah!   CONS:  -Tactics- I know, I know, I put this in pros as well. Sue me. The tactics at times can just be stupid, and the map sizes limit your tactical ability significantly. Hills end where invisible walls begin, etc. Crouching enemies taking a tank and two snipers to kill, and other things like this make the tactical portion of the game annoying at times, but rarely really affect your immersement in the game.   -Accuracy- The enemy has snipers? Say goodbye to any trooper left in the open. The enemy makes ridiculous shots look easy (though they can fail to hit at point blank range) and all the while you are trying to hit them with a fully upgraded sniper rifle only to miss by a millimetre. Infuriating! But, this just makes victory al the sweeter, no?   -Villains- Very Arch, very cleche at times, and altogether an unimaginative lot. They can make you weep with laughter as they say/do the stupidest things. Altogether, not a brilliant bunch.  Overall- I would give the game a 9/10. Not perfect, but an amazing game that keeps you coming back."
"Overall really fun game that has a pretty interesting storyline and quite friendly strategy game that is somewhat forgiving unless you are really ignorant. However, the controls for the tank is EXTREMELY awkward and doesnt quite do what you want it to, possibly causing failure for any operation."
"I'M NOT EVEN FINISH WITH THIS GAME AND IT ALREADY MADE ME SMILE, LAUGH, CRY, AND FEEL FEELING I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD.  GREAT STORY.  GREAT GAMEPLAY."
Tries to not create army of waifus.  Creates army of waifus anyway.  Destroys enemy with army of waifus.  Good decisions were made  10/10
Nice game! Good combination of anime and alternate World war 2-ish
"Story feels kind of like a visual novel sans choices with its length and method of character development (which is pretty good if you enjoy that Japanese style of story telling). The game plays in a strange pseudo-turn based strategy RPG with shooter elements. It plays much better than it sounds.   Every turn you are allocated a specific amount of actions, each troop takes 1, tanks take 2, and you can call in buffs via 'orders' which take these action points. You move each character individually, each turn consisting of a certain amount of movement possible, and a single combat action (healing, shooting, repairs, etc). When you choose to attack, the camera goes over-the-shoulder and you manually aim where you want to shoot, allowing targeting of weakpoints which can come at the risk of doing no damage at all.  The RPG elements come in the division of classes of your soldiers, the leveling and equipment system that each class takes, and with the individual strengths and weaknesses of each soldier. Every soldier has their own set of pros and cons depending on environment, proximity of enemies and allies, random chance, and so on. The quirks aren't exactly necessary to pay attention to, but they do give flavor to the characters, and can prove an insane boon at the right times. Additionally, every soldier has other soldiers that they prefer to fight with, and properly setting up soldiers with other soldiers they prefer leads to multiple soldiers attacking in a single turn, leading to a deeper strategic element to soldier choice, which sadly isn't too necessary at the basic difficulty."
"A unique tactical RPG with good-looking anime-ish graphic style. Set in fictional continent of Europa, it tells the story of Welkin Gunther as he fight to defend his homeland from invaders. The gameplay is interesting and the story is good. Although the dialogues can be a little cheesy.  Overall, a great and highly-enjoyable game."
"Nice surprise, unique concept of tactical game, around 30h of pure campaign, without grinding skirmishes.  This could be awesome strategy game based on VCH with strategy map and action/turn based combat, but instead you get visual novel with few battles, wasted potentional ... anime/manga serves much better as story teller  Nevertheless good game, maybe not worth the full price and certaily not for everyone"
"Superb game, i seriously don't hope anything due to my past experiences of smilar anime-ish games. Except this one.  So lemme point good&amp;bad sides  +Art Style Their anime-ish style is refreshing for this genre, not so colorful- perfectly balanced for my taste.   +Storyline  You can find love, tragedy, comedy etc. etc. also they just spiced with some rpg elements thus you kinda feel game is evolving around yourself.   +Gameplay Not for newbies in begining, but their system is really easy to learn. In game you will get tips for new elements which is vital and in no time you will try to exceed yourself, beat your previous records etc. Both of their turn-based and rpg elements are perfectly designed.   +Music Well... Music was fine, especially in one cut-scene i closed my eyes like rest of my crew and listen that angelic voice too.   And minus(es) -Subtitles!!!!!! I seriously wonder WHO THE ♥♥♥♥ did that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ subtitle, did they get paid? Or murdered afterward? If they get second, good riddience if not, just gimme their adresses and i will ♥♥♥♥ing murder them myself.  The subs were so bad that i seriously think to uninstal the game. Ofc i can close the subs but i was curious how extend they gonna ♥♥♥♥ that job. They ♥♥♥♥ed like champions.  -Eng Voice I kinda tried to listen but that was mediocre... I highly recommend japanese version (if possible) without subs  -Sound effects For sound effects, it was find repulsive. for example grass sounds, that was so repetitive. For example grass sounds. Due to their limited sound files you will be listen that same sound over and over again.   Also i must add, there're too many girl character in this game which some people may find distasteful (their design, their numbers etc.) and between cutscenes and combat-scenes you can find some serious inconsistency about characters (while they're crying and dreaming about war they just became different people in combat, chopping their enemies with evil laughters and smiles = priceless)  In long story shot, it's a good game. Don't be a cheapstake and buy the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Bread Chronicles."
I feel dirty for getting such a good game for only $5. Its like the dollar menu at taco bell without the bathroom pain afterwards.  marina best girl/10
"awesome game, played it years ago on console  made me buy it again for PC"
"Valkyria Chronicles is a strategy turn based game set in a fictional World War 2. The game did what it needs to exemplify the horror of wars, and it succeed with flying colors. The story can be simply put as nothing short of spectacular. It is a dramatic and emotional tale that you don't want to miss. The two of the most unique trait that this game has is its art style and gameplay. The artistic style in this game is a joy to look at. It is a balance blend of comic and anime into one game. While in some other strategy game like the successful XCOM where you click and drag your soldier where to go, in Valkyria Chronicles you are allow to have the freedom of interacting with your squad after selecting them. This will result in bonds between your character and your squad mates as each of them have their own back story and you would learn to care more and more about them. There are five different classes in the game and each specialize in certain category to help aid you in your fight. There are a lot more to talk about when it comes to gameplay, but please trust me when I said this game is a breath of fresh air especially if you are tired of the constantly zombie/fps releases.   In short... Graphic: Excellent Story: Spectacular Gameplay: Amazing Soundtrack: Mesmerizing   Final verdict: A must buy!  'This is an order! Add this game to your cart and checkout!'  'For Gallia!'"
"This game has such a rich and cool story. The gameplay is unique, comprising of both turn-based strategy as well as a little first person shooting! I highly recommend this game to both hardcore and casual gamers! This is by far one of the most interesting games i have ever tired so far. Loving it :D"
Waste of $6...unless you want a game that crashes constantly
"Basically what XCOM - The Bureau should have been, albeit trading the aliens and 1950s sci-fi for a quaint dieselpunk aesthetic."
"This is a great game, holy ♥♥♥♥. 9/10"
"Do I recommend the game: yes and if all you're looking for is another possitive opinion then that's all I have to say to you - move on.  For the rest of you: be aware that this isn't a flawless game by any emans; the Tanks control like ♥♥♥♥, randomlty changing the direction they turn in based on their position relative to the camera and eat movement just to turn on the spot; the character balance is off with many of the characters being literally useless and you can just Alicia rush most levels with minimal sniper support. Some of the cut scenes definitely drag on too long, you can play anime cliche bingo with the plot and for all the effort that went into characterising the various squaddies with unique traits to reflevct their personality - they kick in so randomly that they's almost meaningless; there's no truly memorable, classic characters in here except your usual preferred loadout. The plot has pretenses at depath but it's really just Anime World War 2 that may as well be constantly yelling 'HEY! THE DARCSENS ARE THE JEWS! HEY! DO YOU GET IT!' - I'm all for games trying to tackle sensitive subjects but writing this blunt isn't doing the game a favor. However as the combat eats up the majority of the play time. perhaps the biggest problem is that Valkyria Chroinicle's main source of challenge is to just not tell you important things like for example critical mission details that ultimately force you to reload a save after the first attempt flounders in the first 3 turns. The last boss deserves a special mention because although it's not difficult per se miss more than a handful of shots and you quickly get trapped in a grind.   ...that said; for all it's warts; it's a game of simple pleasures, excellent mechanics, a charming personality and fantastic depth. If you want to you can go for A rank in every misison which is very challenging in many cases but honestly I just enjoy the game's missions for what they are - fun mixed turnn based and RTS combat and don't even consider replaying the skirmishes grinding (even though they are), I just enjoy it. Although the potentials are a bit too random for my taste, they are still a great way of flavouring the characters who are in turn a wonderfully eclectic bunch so you'll definitely end up with favourites (Jane, Nadine, Marina, Jann and Aika were mine). The new game plus is well developed too; offering you harder challenges, new characters, filled out backstories on all your favourites and a chance to push for all those A Ranks (many of which are still hard even at level 20) with your new insight and toys.  Overall, for all it's shortcomings, it's just good fun and a genuinely enjoyable game that's spawned a devoted community with good reason - I love it to bits and will probably be playing the occasional skirmish at random for years to come."
"Its fun and all, but the character movements in action mode are kind of glitchy and sometimes stop suddenly and I end up taking lot of damage that could have been avoided."
I was crying at the end of the game
"I really enjoyed Valkyria Chronicles in many ways. The characters are well-developed, the romance is excellent, and the story itself is amazing. The gameplay is quite unique as well, obviously combining elements from strategy RPGs such as the Fire Emblem series with more action-based combat. Each turn has a sense of urgency, as even when simply moving, you need to be sure to keep an eye on your surroundings. An enemy hiding in tall grass or behind a building could eliminate your character with ease.  The only flaw I can find with Valkyria Chronicles on the PC are a few issues with controls. It seems the port from the PlayStation 3 didn't go as smoothly as one might hope, as controlling certain characters with keyboard-and-mouse controls can be difficult. The Edelweiss (tank) sees these issues more often than anything else, but the game is far from unplayable even with this issue. I would recommend playing with a gamepad to circumvent this issue, but don't be afraid to play with a keyboard-and-mouse. Controlling the Edelweiss just takes a little bit to get used to.  The graphics are absolutely incredible. Just like the anime, everything looks hand-painted and watercolored. The music is just as amazing as well! These are the types of graphics that hold up regardless of time, as they have their own unique flair to them that just doesn't seem to age.  As a side note, the game does not have the same Japanese voice actors as the anime. This was a little disappointing, as the voice actor that portrays Alicia in the anime is one of my all-time voice actors. It's not really a flaw, but certainly something to note. (The English voice actors are surprisingly good.)  All in all, Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing game that I would recommend even at full price. It is definitely worth the money for the experience it provides. (Also, may I recommend that you watch the anime after playing the game?)"
"Great game. Pros: good story, good challenge for me (not an experienced tactical gamer); Cons interface is a bit counter intuitive for me, I keep pushing the esc where the f is needed, and if I don't pay attention finishing the turn instead of issueing orders, similarly I keep running into low-ground terrain that I apparently cannot cross, but cannot clearly see on the ground. Another flaw for me is unwinnable fights you only win due to the stupidity of the opposition... Don't get me wrong, unwinneble fights are even worse, but I don't like to be rescued by plotbook without at least some decent excuse (such as they don't know shooting the tank kills the leader).  Spoiler alert:  In the 2nd desert battle that woman could have wiped out my whole unit without a trouble, but instead she stays on one side of the big tank allowing the lancers to shoot at peace? Really?"
"Bought this game when it first came out on PS3 and I'm glad it's out on steam. Got it for a good price on steam sales. My only issue with the game is driving the tank; it's horrible and I mean hair-ripping aweful. The camera and controls goes nuts when driving the tank; It's not game breaking, but it's sticks out like a sore thumb. Still worth buying whether on steam or PS3(if you can find a copy). Great Tatical JRPG with a unique mechanic, memorable characters, and a difficult game as the game goes on."
"No amount of barriers, fences, girders, bridges, higher ground, being across the map, and placing a unit directly in the way will prevent Jedi Sniper Tanks from finding that one dam exhaust port. Their tank round will find the pin hole, curve around barriers, and your lancer, who has ONE JOB, decides to dodge the one tank round, which are laughably inaccurate, that game overs you. 9/10 Would rage again.  The PC version has DLC, find them in the extra while on the title menu. They're awesome."
"I honestly really like this game, except for that damned tank. It's so innaccurate it's almost useless. When I was going through the Defend the gate section in Chapter 2, I aimed for the middle of the enemy tank, and ended up shooting the gate, ending the mission in failure."
i love this game :D
loveing this game
"This was the best $20 i had spent on a game. It has Great Grahics lovely story, and it is just awesome."
"Was hoping for something like Fire Emblem. Gave this a shot due to popularity and the fact it was also on sale.  Controls are horrid, and the gameplay is just lackluster for me."
i need to finish this tbh
"[ENG] As a japanfag i'd absolutely reccomend this anime-style game (who wouldn't want to have sexy waifus combatting for you? lel). Despite that, the game itself has a cool storyline, the gameplay is a tactical rpg with an original style (maybe it's a bit frustrating because the game is quite long, but still nice) and the graphic is very enjoyable.  Especially if you are interested in a game with cut-scenes and not just gameplay, this is the game for you, because it has many of them. By the way i'd really appreciate if the DLC with Selvaria would have been longer :'( Ps: SELVARIA IS LOVE, SELVARIA IS LIFE.  [ITA] Da Giappofag consiglio assolutamente questo gioco in stile anime (chi non vorrebbe delle sexy waifu combattere per te? lel). A parte questo aspetto, il gioco ha comunque una trama curata, un gameplay jrpg tattico con uno stile originale (forse un pò ripetitivo/frustrante dopo un pò perchè il gioco è abbastanza lungo, ma ancora piacevole) e la grafica è veramente carina. Soprattutto se vi piacciono le cut-scenes e non solo gameplay, questo gioco fa per voi, soprattutto perchè ne è strapieno. Comunque mi sarebbe piaciuto se il DLC con Selvaria sarebbe durato di più :'( Ps: SELVARIA IS LOVE, SELVARIA IS LIFE."
"Played it with PS3 and replayed on PC. The story, graphics and RPG elements are a great mix!"
RPG x Strategy x kawaii characters x tanks x good story x beautiful graphics x book stylized interface = Valkyria Chronicles. 9/10
"Wanted hot anime girls. Didn't really get that, pretty disappointed.  Game was fun tho."
"I've been a fan of jrpgs for a long time, but I never could get into tactical subgenre. Even Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre and Disgaea got me bored quickly. Valkyria Chronicles (along with both Fire Emblems for GBA) is an exception.  To make this quick, Valkyria Chronicles has: interesting characters, silly story that sometimes gets darker and more serious, excellent gameplay (a little bit unbalanced), nice visuals, a flying pig as a mascot and really good Japanese voice acting.  This game is a must-have for every jrpg fan."
"Excellent game. The artwork is superb, the story is enjoyable, and the battles are a challenge. I would recommend it."
Equipped the Edelweiss with all available accuracy upgrades and shot Selveria Bles in the face repeatedly from across the combat zone.  10/10 would shoot Valkyrur in the face with tank rounds again.
"This game is so freaking Beautiful, dont juge it by the first look of it like I did, it sure cracks a punch"
"FireEmblem meets World War II Alternative World... Real time play with some Turn based elements, Really have to enjoy the fact that you aren't going to believe in one unit and one unit alone, very well thought out.  Your Tank is not the End all Be all solution, you actually have to rely on your infantry supports of the Engineers, Snipers, Scouts, Lancers, and ShockTroopers...  I originally thought that the tank was the answer to all but it eats up a lot of resources and a sniper or a scout can accomplish the same thing easily enough without having to worry about being the number one target of Anti tank soldiers or other tanks when it comes to taking and holding an objective.  Really REALLY wish that they had a multiplayer feature to this of Commander vs Commander, i think it would really have made the game fun for friends who Enjoy the Strategy aspect of this game... the Real time elements are fantastic as well when it comes to controlling your troops in person (With a minor timer of how far you can run :P)  I highly recommend this game to anyone out there who loves Strategy games!  So many strategies to work from Research and Development to Troops Experience and even Your Troops composition, certain troops hate one another and you have to know how to act accordingly with the formations.  This game certainly is a Gem :D"
"While looking pretty old and simple this game is one of the most enjoyable I have ever played. It has great design, playing mechanics, and above all story. Modern games can learn a thing or two from it and this game is worth every penny."
Valkyria Chronicles is a great change of pace game from other games for the strategy genre.   PROS : combat is entertaining there's a lot to do not obvious to tell it's a port  CONS : chapter titles can give hints for plots tank driving mechanics are horrible you can bum rush levels with just alicia
"A great mix of very appealing watercolour style anime visuals, a touching and engaging storyline and a very enjoyable mixture of real time and turn based strategy.  I thoroughly enjoyed playing through the entire campaiagn, which easily provides 50+ hours of enjoyment. Choosing the right squad of soldiers and then outmaneuvering the enemy through the use of a well planned strategy during the battles phases is very satisfying, and between these the developments in the story are told through comic book style scenes which are a mixture of cutscenes and character dialogue.  Altogether very enjoyable and definitely recommended."
"Fun to play, a turn based strategy game that actually requires strategy and characters that linger in your mind afterwards. A solid game, now I'm just waiting for the next one to come out on steam."
""
Favourite game on PS3 and now PC too!
"Even thought this game is 6 years old ( released in PS3 first) , it still hasn't lose its edge  This is one of the best strategy game I have played in a while. It has a mixture of RPG, Turn Based Game and TPS. All of the characters are special and deep in term of relation. The creator sure takes his/her time assigning each of the characters relationship. The story itself is good and flawless. - What can you expect : - If you have played XCOM titles, you sure can feel the same vibe in this game - Four cool classes that each has their own ups and downs - A punishing yet rewarding combat system - What to expect : - Attacking rely on luck, expect at near proximity - Pretty much the hit and miss concept is the same as XCOM, but this game has multiple hit So, it is not entirely luck reliant - Totally worth the bucks"
"This is my first game review ever. First, I hate turn based game. So, why I buy this game? Because it is anime style game and given very good rating both in steam and outside steam.   The cons first: - The battle can be tough. I hate tough game. For me game should be an enjoyment after a whole hard daily days. But never the less, the battle winable. - What I hate the most is how bad their aiming is. Let me give two example. I use sniper and have enemy head in my scoope, should be a perfect shot. But, IT MISS! Well may be the game count something that I don't know. The second example will be more frustrating. I have my anti tank personel right behind, say less than two meter, from enemy tank weak point. I shot, and MISS! - The tactical map is not show much about terrain. It's feel like flat ground.  - The tank movement difficult to handle. You will need to reset camera often.  - No mouse support in game menu - To gain rank A, you must be a happy go lucky not dead soldier. I meant, the game prefer full assault approach rather than slow carefull approach.  - Hard to positioning your unit and where you want him/her to see.  - No walk mode especially for enginer. I want to diffuse mine and stop near it. The game shows that I can't diffuse it yet. So I move forward again, and... because the soilder is not walking, he step on the mine and goes booom!  - I have one of my soldier behind a crouching enemy and aiming to its head. But the game said that I need 25 hit to kill that guy. If the enemy is standing, it will need only two perfect shot at head to kill him. Just because he was croucing, I need 25 hit on the head to kill him? Oh come on! - Friendly intel is suck. This can make you made wrong decission who and where to deploy. Example: sometime they don't say if the enemy have tank or not.   Pros: + Excelent anime style art and seiyuu. + Have skirmish where you can looking for exp and money and sharpen your tactic.  + Great characters. Really amushing with each have unique personality. + I don't know about the story just yet because I haven't finish the game yet. But many said the story is good, so maybe it is.   Well, maybe that's all for now. Like you see, many my conplaints is about battle event. But nevertheless, it was fun battle especially after you win it.   final score? 6/10"
"As a person who doesn't play a lot of Japanese games (except Resident Evil and Dead Rising), this game is really good. Upon playing the game, X-COM instantly comes to mind, except with a weird sci-fi/ fantasy mix of World War 2. You control each unit personally instead of issuing move orders from a birds-eye view. You also micromanage your forces and develop better equipment as the game progresses, again like X-COM. The graphics are quite pretty to look upon; like a painting in motion. And the story, even though it switiches from tongue-in-cheek fun to knitty-gritty warfare is constant, it is quite gripping at times. Gameplay is desent and easy to get to grips with and the enemy AI is quite challenging, which is what I didn't expect actually.  If there were any flaws with this game, I would hihglight two; cutscenes and not skipping enemy moves. There are quite a lot of cutscenes in this game, so be prepared for that. But this is a two-sided coin. Although becoming quite annoying as you have to watch them to progress the game, it also tells the story of the campaign as well. Another flaw is the enemy's turn in combat. Since you can't skip them, you have to watch every turn and move the enemy makes.   Overall, this is the only anime-style game that I quite like. Good gameplay with challenging AI as well as a good story. If you like X-COM as well as anime, this nis for you. If you just like strategy, this is a recommendation for strategy game lovers! "
"One of the best strategy games I've played in a long time. Although some of the stereotypical anime tropes can get annoying after a while and the grinding can be mind-numbing, it still provides a deep and fun experience throughout. Also, it has one of the best war stories I've seen in any game."
Think of a third person fire emblem. That's how I can best describe this game.
A surprisingly compelling anime re-imagining of WWII story with an X-Com style combat system. Yeah this game is fantastic.
I'm having to play this game in 800x600 windowed mode and still loving the hell  out of it.  Great story. Great style. Great Fish. 9/10 will play again
"I'm no critic just a gamer, But having watched the anime and then playing the game. I'd give it a 8/10 there are similaritys but there are alos major diffrences."
"Very good game, Amazing Story,Characters and Gameplay.  When i first bought this on the PS3 I did not think I would Like it, but after playing it i could not stop playing it to see what would happen, even bought it for PC and want another copy sealed just because of how amazing it is.  Even played Valkyria chronicles 2 (want that on PC too but doubt they would convert it) just a shame about valkyria Chronicles 3 not being released out of Japan (one can hope that one day they do)"
"Great Game, its has good studi gibili anime look to it, it is fun, strategic and yet challenging."
"Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing game with timeless graphics, memorable characters, a compelling plot, and fascinating with in depth battle mechanics. It was a underappreciated classic when it was first introduced to the West as a PS3 game that is worthy of high praise and recognition. Each character has something unique to themselves that will immerse players in the world of Valkyria Chronicles as they play the role of Lieutenant Welkin Gunther of the Galilean 7th militia squad. Everything about this near perfect but I do have so complains however. First off, there's some glitches with the characters especially the engineers who spases out but it's actually quite entertaining. Some levels seem nearly impossible to overcome with the death of squad members but with enough determination, players can beat levels at ease. And finally, sometimes when players controll troops to fire upon enemy soldiers, it can become unfair to the player as the accuracy is quite questionable when used. Overall, it's a game that strategic gamers should pick up and try out."
"A great blend of RPG and Strategy, the trun based system is done as well as the legends of old like UFO: Enemy Unkown. The RPG elementes add a brilliant level of customization to your squad which is done even more credit by the way the weapons stats and effects work, meaning you can futher specialize soldiers in an already specialzed class. The Story was well paced and I found myself spending more than one night playing through a mission instead of going to sleep.  There are a few things that get annoying for example the AI is very predictable to the point you can kill them in their own turn by a few well placed shocktroops. The save system isn't terrible if you remember to do it often, however multi-phased missions can get tiresome if you fail it on the last section only to redo everything to that point.  Overall it's a good game at a good price."
"Have to be honest I didn't expect this game to be as enjoyable as it was. If you are into anime-style art of any form you'll be rather likely to enjoy this game based on the appearance alone. The story while rather simple remains engaging throughout and at times can be surprisingly emotional.   The game-play forces the player to position units cautiously and meticulously, as a wrong turn could cause a quick death of a valued team member. The fear of losing a member of your team adds a certain sense of urgency and desire to keep your squad safe which makes each battle feel much more dangerous and each turn more meaningful. This game can be rather difficult as certain levels can in the best possible way 'kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of you' forcing you to scramble all of your assets to clutch on to victory.  Solid game 8.5/10"
This game is absolutely amazing. 
"A game that brings us to the love, sad, and heroic storyline. And don't forget the tactical turn-based RPG. Highly recommended"
"A great game, and a functional port. I do suggest playing it with a controller, and don't try to push the game over 60 fps. While there is an option to run at 120 fps and 144 fps, running the game faster than 60 fps results in some pretty strange bugs. The tank movement gets painfully cumbersome, and ultimately, at 144 fps, I was unable to finish one of the missions as my soldiers couldn't move up a ramp."
love the game &lt;3 hope that the sequel comes to pc too!
This game is a great mix of turn based and RPG gameplay. It's a unique mix as far as I can tell and it works really well to mix up the turn based games out there!
"Short Review:  1.) Awesome Game 2.) Buy it quickly and play it 3.) Lots of strategy, good combat system, mixed with a dash of myrth in the story. 4.) Voice acting is well above average, and the only thing that isnt a 10/10.  9.75/10 - Pick it up today and enjoy it"
"A Great Game, If you like turned based game with some RPG then you'll be into this game (10 out of 10)"
"Thought I was about to over take a base. Giant tank comes in, wipes out half my forces in a morbid blood bath. 10/10"
"An absolute must have for all who love strategy, and hate grids. Unique gameplay, beautiful music, and the graphics are stunning."
"A fabulous, huge game. There must be 60 hours of gameplay. Great story, and the battles are far better than the phrase 'turn based' suggests. The graphics are 3D cartoon-style, which makes it feel less real (and actually makes fighting more enjoyable in the process). The voice acting is good, so very good.  Each soldier has a different personality and traits. Gay anti-tank men, lesbian engineers, bi-sexual troopers - this game has everything. Just innuendo, but it's great fun.  Highly recommended - enjoy."
"Just startling in its quality. I've only played the first mission, but I'm already hooked on the story...."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a tactical squad turn-based game, with a lot of emphasis on the story and character development. From a game point of view it's pretty difficult without any outside help, but what pulled me in and kept me playing was the narrative and how likable the characters were.  This is a war story told both with levity and seriousness. It has a charming naivete and simplicity on how it will serves all the war tropes on you, and these same tropes will help ease the serious matters when they're broached upon, such as death, racism, war camps and hatred.  A great war game."
This is a great strategy/tactical squad based game with lots of customisation for your squad and a decent storyline.   
"This game is a very well designed strategical shooter. You will individually select a soldier under your command and move that soldier on the battle field in third person. You then select an enemy for the soldier to shoot at (in third person). The soldier shoots where you aim on the enemy. Strategy is a factor because you can get a soldier killed if you have them move to the wrong place. I enjoy the take on the graphics, which are presented in a water color painting style. I also enjoy the story, in which you command a unit of militia (citizen soldiers) againts a much larger professional army. This game should be a must buy for gamers who like shooters with good storylines."
"This game is excellent. I was attached to every single character and tried my damnedest to avoid losing him or her. The chemistry between various characters is even better. The story and setting are sensational. The gameplay was great, but the AI was somewhat stupid. Highly recommend this game if you think slightly flawed gameplay can be balanced out through fantastic story."
What's not to like! Aside from a regretable fact that the sequals are PSP.
"Great game, literally just finished it :D ----- The short video after the credits nearly made me cry :')  I really hope they port Valkyria chronicles 2 and 3 for PC in the future. ----- Selvaria is also my new waifu :3  sugoi/10 would waifu again xD  ----- Highly recommend this game :D"
AWESOME!!!!!! Played for days!! Loved the story!! TwT
"Good game, but grinding for XP was kind of annoying."
"Wanted to remove Welkin and Zaka so I could turn Squad 7 into Waifu Company. Unfortunately I couldn't so I settled with the Harem Corps.  11/10, would definitely buy for the plot"
A well-made PC port of a good PS3 game. It's basically a tactical turn-based strategy game with 3rd-person shooter elements. 9/10.
Great port of a great game. Accuracy can feel a little unfair at low levels but there is a significant and noticable improvement as your soldiers and equipment improve from the farmland to cities.  Only negative is the character writing which is usually very simple with themes of friendship and a few strange instances where noble sacrifices feel very forced when a simpler action at the time of the sacrifice could have accomplished the same result.
"Love this anime, so buy game."
"I expect some anime-style third person Call of Duty/Battlefied war game  I got instead, a Band of 'Nakama' journal-like story from the dawn of war until it last  I ain't mad, it was an awesome journey  Also, Harem Squad"
"Great game, right up until a certain mission, then it's not a great game. Unless you enjoy paying for endless frustration."
"I'm not typically the type to write a review, but this game needs a lot more love. I was looking for something new to play, and wanted something like an RPG. What I got was something new and fresh, addictively fun and without a doubt the most enjoyable game I've played this year."
"I remember how jealous PC gamers like me were of PS3 players; I too savored the early news of its coming to Steam. At the time of this review, I've slogged all the way up to Chapter 12 of the story, and I'm not disappointed at all!  I won't spoil Valkyria Chronicles' story, but let's just say its a sumptuous feast of challenging missions, wonderful characters, and breathtaking drama, including depictions of racism NEVER shown in WWII games! You'll have a feel for the unique gameplay by the end of the earliest chapters.  Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best PC ports since the first Halo, and my favorite presents from Christmas 2014. The evil Imperial Alliance is invading the little nation of Gallia! Take command of Squad 7, and fight back!"
Got this game because I like XCOM and I like anime. As I played I learned that this game is special in it's own way and I'm looking forward for them to make Valkyria Chronicles 2 available for PC
What an awesome game !
"Good game,i just can take 15 years old girls in squad and go to war.10 Valyries outa ten"
"Good game with an interesting fighting system.  I've seen a lot of posts saying the storyline/characters is/are well developed but I disagree. The storyline is alright: a country at war, an extinct race of semi-gods, it's not too bad. The characters and how they interact with each other makes me gag, though. They're so whiny and self centered. When one of them gets wounded (and survives), they're all like 'How dare they!', seemingly forgetting how many people they've actually killed themselves. But this is just my opinion, and the story doesn't take much away from the gameplay. The combat mechanics and challenging missions are well worth the purchase."
"It was one of the best game I have ever played. The gameplay is really fun if your into strategy. The soundtrack is AMAZING it gets my vote for best soundtrack ever. The story is really good too, its the only story that I ever have cried for. For me this game is 10/10, one of the best game ever."
Good game for Anime Tactic Gameplaybase ^ ^ !
Allergic to metal... still in the army.
"I've played Valkyria Chronicles for almost 20 hours, and still feel like I've barely scratched the surface. It's a tactical JRPG without magic, set in a world that manages to fit WWII-like conflict and drama alongside adorable pigs with wings called Porcavians.  Freaking. Porcavians. Man. Awesome.  Did a short Let's Play series you can find below--can't recommend it enough!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbHijzpmb98 "
Played it a ton for ps3. Game is a great strategy game. ^^
"This game is both challenging, fun, and at times utterly frustrating. Having watched the that was based off of this game I can say that while I generally knew what was going to happen, the game is so much deeper and has so much more story to it that I spent hours just enjoying the side stories. The combat while not ultra intuitive, is still fun and decently tactical, no Haloing your way through this game (usually)  To enjoy this game to the fullest I  highly  reccomend a controller of some type,   it will make driving the edelwiess sooo much easier/efficient.  "
"Valkyria Chronicles is amazing, a great strategic game is like a Fire Emblem game, but with rifles instead of swords All the characters are great, any of them has an unique personality, and unique abilities to strenghten your strategy  And I still have not talked about the story here, but I can't. You must play it to know the drama and the twists this game has "
"i in love with the game no word can describe it, its a good one and i definitely recommence any people out there who wondering should they buy this game? totally go for it"
"A PlayStation classic, a real golden-oldie, Valkyria Chronicles is FINALLY out on the PC! Never have I played a game that has the combat style of XCOM with the captivation of a developed story and characters like anime. The art style for this game is nice, bringing a 3D feel to anime, and the expressions are portrayed in a way that emerses the player into the game. The story goes into quite depth, but also adds some levity where needed to smooth out rough patches. Every character, even the ones that are optional for recruit, have a backstory that you can explore. Even the goons of this game have their own cutscenes to bring into light their side of the story.   If you don't like combats that can last for an hour, this game is not for you. The combat seems a little underdeveloped but is still fun and challenging at times. There are 5 classes, Scout, ShockTrooper, Lancer, Engineer, and Sniper that you can pick your Squad from. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, say a Scout can run very far and retrieve intelligence but lacks in firepower, and ShockTroopers have heavy damage output but lower movement, etc. However, Scout seems very overpowered given that you upgrade your equipment frequently and level them more than the others. That aside, tanks are also a big part of combat. Having only other tanks and Lancers to destroy them seems a bit harsh, since grenades mostly never hit the body section anyway. Also, the difficulty curve on this game is a big challenge. But the way you can command troops and do combat in two different stages with an overview and Third person shooter make the combat attractive.  Thank you for Listening :D"
Amazing Game. Highly Recommend picking it up while its on sale.
"Have this on PS3 with over 100 hours as well. My experience with this game and since I've been playing this game with offline mode on my laptop, my time hasn't been updated on steam yet.   Used Accuracy order to increase accuracy. Stood 10 inches in front of an enemy with a sniper unit. Zoomed in 100% so the entire head was in my crosshairs. Shoots. Watches bullet fly away from the enemy's head and miss.  Uses tank from spawn. Aims at somebody on the other side of the map. Shoots an anti tank round. Hits them in the head and one shots them.  20/10 Fire Emblem + XCOM hit rates on point.  PS: Mouse and keyboard controls with tank = epileptic tank twitching in one spot for all of your stamina ending in seizure raging. ."
Great game. Everyone should buy.
For 5$ you cant go wrong with a nice turn based strat rpg
"One of, if not the best game I have ever played. Beautiful artwork, beautiful designs and a great story coupled with challenging and unique gameplay."
"This game is surprisingly good. It comes at a rather weird 'turn-based-strategy', but it adds to immersion, and the story is very nice.... lots of allegories to the real war  While the campaign has little replay value, the game has a 'save+' mechanic that allows you to explore/research more.   Overall good. Pretty much no drawbacks.... especially better during promotions"
A blend of strategy and action. Tells a good story which is the primary reason for playing this game.
"I highly recommend Valkyria Chronicles on STEAM. If you love third person shooters, RPG elements, an awesome story and RTS tabletop like gameplay then this is for you. Valkyria Chronicles is really good game and it is regarded as the best RTS game on the PS3. The PC version is an amazing port.  This game will make you pull your hair out over trying to keep a single soldier in Squad 7 alive. It's fantastic!"
It's got guns It's got anime It's not garbage Pretty much all I need in a game
"The game crashed on me two hours in and silly me was so enthralled by the story that I wasn't saving.   This is a very unforgiving game when it comes to saving. There are no auto saves and if it crashes there is no way to recover that data. You just have to start all over again.  Honestly, worth doing the first two hours over again. Once you break out of the prologue and first few chapters it takes off. Bear with the game, you have pretty much no control to start but once you make it to the city it gets very addicting."
"Tanks, girls, superpowers. What more could you possibly ask for?"
"Starts out with you drawing some fishes, and gets arrested because you might be a spy. 10/10 would get arrested again for drawing a fish."
"I had not played a game of this format, turn based, in a while. It was fun to play this style again. Especially when the story is good, and the characters make you care about them. I'm glad the PC version came with all of the add-ons at a great price too. As others have noted, it is a WW2 type story in a fictionalized europe. Hope a sequel comes out for it."
Fantastic strategy RPG from SEGA. Worth every cent.
Top Notch
A great combination between a first person shooter and a tacticle RPG with a cool twist. This game is filled with amazing cutscenes.
"This is prehaps one of the best single player games that I have played. Story is good and characters are fun. Combat is refreshingly different. Art and soundtrack are stellar, unique and fit the game really well. If you are looking for something that you can sink many hours into and love, $20 is a small price.  (The only better $20 purchase was my cat :P ) "
I originally played Valkyria Chronicles on a friends PS3. Once it became available on Steam I immidiatly jumped on it and it has not dissapointed. It's a good port of an amazing game!!
"The easiest way to describe this, if I was talking to myself, is that it is the console version of Advance Wars I always wanted. A strangely cheeky and cheerful look at Not World War II, this strategy game is a solid entry that unfortunately hasn't seen any more releases on non-portables.  Gameplay is essentially moving around units in 3rd person, but the RPG elements and charm to the skirmishes (aside from the weird Japanese eccentricities that, for me, were boring and needless) kept me playing hour after hour. The only other drawback from this game is that sometimes enemy turns take much longer than they need to, with the camera jumping in and out of the overworld view for simple things like mortar fires or rockslides.  "
"One of the best tactical game I ever play, with some nifty story line to it.  Highly recommend everyone to play this!"
wow such a amazing game!
- Great game - Good story - You get to really know the main characters which is pretty rare with games today  - It's a nostalgic game that takes me back to the days (the 90's) when Anime style games were badass. It's got a good story and you really get to know and love the main characters.  - I guess some people will say that this game is like X-com Declassified and it sort of is but Valkyria is about 2 times more challenging and has a satisfying ending. 
This game is awesome. Gone are the turn-based style of action and in its place a very well rounded game. With a very good story so far. Haven't played a J-RPG this great since Final Fantasy. Very excited for more:)))
"Great turn-based strategy game. I really like the fact that your characters level up as a class, rather than individuals, so if you want to swap someone in late game you don't have to worry about them being completely underpowered.  Also, great music!  Just be aware that there is a fair amount of 'plot' (ie, cutscenes) that you have to go through to get to the actual playable missions.  My only complaint is that the game rewards a certain style of winning missions: running in head first and doing them as fast as humanly possible. I far prefer the slow, strategic method of wiping a board out completely! Fortunately, I never had a problem with the amount of XP and gold recieved for doing it the 'slow and steady' method. :)"
"Wanted to play this game since I was a kid but I don't own a PS3 up till this date, however now I have finally lived the dream thanks to this gem being ported to the PC  11/10 will live the dream again YEAAAA"
this is one of my most favourite games ive ever played. the music is super amazing. and selvaria bles is a boss. to many other good thing that make this game fun to play but three reasons is good enuf. super fun turn bassed rpg !!!!!!
"Great game, 5/5*"
"This game is anime WW2. Despite this, it's pretty damned fun.  I played all the way through and didn't need to grind the same random battles or go on stupid quests that stretch out the game pointlessly.  The weird hybrid real time / turn based combat made for some of the best tense squad based combat I've played in a game.  The game is super fun. Buy it and help liberate anime Belgium from anime Russia."
loved this game it was one of the best turned based games ive played in a long while. The Music was fit the right places at the right time it was timed perfectly. The story was excellent overall good games.
This game is actually really fun  Pro's:  - turn based tactical team combat - choose your own team makeup / team members - buy upgrades in between missions - run people over with a tank - Story is pretty good  Con's: - controls are a bit off since it's a port. You get used to them though - some missions are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t - it's still an anime story  Overall:  Fun game! would recommend
Great game on PC. Good voice acting and story But trying to control the tanks can be very fustrating.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag27fZ0AsI4&amp;list=PL1OMbqBexo6bSngHEuizWsndPJwj8kKr_ 
"The game make many mistakes in the interface. For example, the training camp is irrelevant, and you shouldn't need that many clicks/keys to navigate the book, the chapters, the headquarters, etc... For example I don't need the boss mechanic talking to me every time I buy an upgrade, or the drill instructor every time I try to level up my troops.  I kinda understand the book interface; yet I find it irrelevant. Again too much loading screens in between mini-dialogs.  The order cinematic is not skipable. It should be. My main reason to not use the order is not the CP cost, but the timing.  During the battles, the characters sometime refuse to walk to narrow spaces, or climb little steps. It should be more clear when you can go to somewhere before you hit an invisible wall.  Another bad thing. The team survive too much. The characters have a very elaborate story behind each one of them. Their personalities, their voices, their faces. It should be really dangerous to be out there. I'm talking at XCOM ironman on impossible level of dangerous. All of those stories become irrelevant, because is really difficult to die in this war (unless you are a civilian).  There are some medium spoilers in the intro. That could have been a really sh*tting your pants moment after/during the temple mission.  So in general the game feels slow and with poor attention to the details. Which is quite a pitty. For example, the XCOM is much more dynamic, much less talking and more fighting is what this game needs.  However, the tactics and battles are quite original and enjoyable. I really see a lot of potential for the series and I hope the devs upgrade and make a second part, or another game, correcting a lot of little mistakes."
YES! This is an excelent port! Such an amazing game! I loved it on the PS and have been really enjoying it! If you are looking for a different style of strategy game then give this one a shot! Worth every cent!
"The game look great, I never thought I would like the cell shading."
Just bloody amazing
"This is a game near and dear to me. First off, the aesthetic. Oh my God, the vehicles and the weapons and the costumes are so gorgeous in this game. From the saddle bags on the tanks to the little map pinned to Welkin's shirt. Its incredible. The setting is fantastic as well. I love worlds created out of 1930s-1940s technology. There's not many of them compared to the ocean of fantasy and steampunk worlds, but this is one of the best the genre has to offer. The gameplay is a lot of fun. Due to a bug, the damage inflicted on my units was far higher than usual. It had something to do with the framerate and the game registering several consecutive hits at once. It wasn't a problem though. I actually preferred how difficult it made the game. There's a forgiving permadeath system. Units can die but it takes a lot of negligence to let that happen before the difficulty ramps up in the second half of the game. Leveling up classes instead of the units themselves is ingenius and perfect for this sort of game. The story, and on this I'm going to differ in opinion from a lot of my collegues, is nothing special. Its totally workman, there's nothing especially good or bad about it. It can get a little 'anime-y'. And don't get me wrong, I love anime, but it can get a little more K-On than Venus Wars, if you know what I mean. The game is not perfect. The Engineer class is severly underpowered, and there are certain tactics that can be exploited to make the entire game a complete joke. I reccomend not spoiling it for yourself and just playing the way you like. And not to beat yourself up over losing or letting people die. Just have fun. There are sequels to this game. They are PSP exclusives ( :^( ). I've played a lot of V2, its fun, but it doesn't hold a candle to this one. I really hope Sega wakes up and realizes this series deserves another proper fully fledged entry, not a portable grind fest."
Fantastic Gameplay. I really loved the strategy elements. Would love to see this done to Fire Emblem.
Awesome strategy game
"One of the best RPGs to eveer grace the PS3. I have yet to really find fault with the game, though I'm not very far into the storyline on this version. Definitely a must buy for any JPRG Fan."
"As a fan of Fire Emblem, Advance Wars, and Code Geass, this game hits many marks I have enjoyed individually all in one glorious package. The character development, storytelling (and risk of death) of Fire Emblem mixed with combined arms tactics from AW: Days of Ruin have combined in this truly amazing experience. I knew I'd be partial to the game going in, yet the cinematics, combat system, and squad management/upgrades were a pleasant and highly engaging surprise. I highly recommend this game, and I know I'm nowhere near to seeing all it has to offer."
"Valkyria Chronicles is an old game, however that doesn't stop it being one of the best. It's got a good story and good gameplay. Pick this up if you haven't already."
Amazing Game. I've Only had it for a day or two and love it. The combat is great and personally I think it's better thank X-Com's
"This game managed to grasp me, while I should have been studying for my exams..."
Advance Wars + Batallion Wars + Fire Emblem = Valkyria Wars. Awesome combo of graphic novel and turnbased strategy/3ps.
"Played it on ps3 when it released. Great port, runs well on low end machines. Nice anime aesthetic, doesn't get too bogged down in anime tropes though. Xcom-style mixed with 3rd person combat, gets quite challenging. Explores some of the issues of war quite well. Nice soundtrack."
"A great mix of Turn Based stragey with a bit of FPS and team management. There are a few things that can be a pain, but over all it is great to over come them."
An excellent story wrapped in compelling if slightly unbalanced gameplay. Taking your time and enjoying the missions rather than trying to scout-rush them will result in a slower but more enjoyable experience.
"Not a huge fan of anime style game but i really enjoy this one, acutaly gameplay isnt too hard to learn but still manages to be a challenge. Also the story is a interesting take on WWII i would recomend this to any one who enjoys games such as xcom"
"Goofy anime ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and the horrors of WWII (racial intolerance, mass genocide, morally questionable destruction) collide"
"This game is one of the most entertaining and addictive I've ever played. What I thought would be a simple shooting game with little to it, turned into an epic story where your greatest weapon is your mind! In fact, I'd go so far as to say I find this game more fun than shooting games such as Call of Duty or Halo. In those games, victory depends almost entirely on your weapon strength and button mashing. In this game, strategy is far more valuable than weapons, and that's the way I like it!  If you're a lover of strategy, interesting stories, and a game that forces you to think before you act, then this is the PERFECT game to get!"
"This is my favorite game from the last generation of consoles, but I didn't get to finish it before my PS3 broke  Pros: The Game play - This is my favorite turn based game ever, it is simple yet surprisingly in depth and fun. The only thing that could make this more fun is online multiplayer.   The Art - Holy ♥♥♥♥ this is the best looking game of the last generation consoles and it looks sooo so good in full HD and with GPU enabled AA keeping the lines sharp this game looks great and is easy to run, Cell shading has grown up and it aged well.  The Characters - Even though most of your group isn't well developed they have defined character traits that make some of them interesting, many in your crew will blend into the background but some feel like a distinct loss when they die, because if they die and are not recovered or are recovered by the enemy they are gone for good. I genuinly was tempted to restart a mission because I lost the sadistic Jane Turner who I enjoyed her enjoyment of putting bullets in people.  Cons: The story - This is an acceptable story that gets you from mission to mission and explains what going on but it's uninteresting filler setting up interesting battles, if you like anime there are a few moments that will warm your heart but for the most part it's not great.  No auto save - I didn't beat this game on the PS3 for any reason other than the lack of an autosave funtion, and having to replay multiple missions multiple times and lossing lots of progress because forgot that it lacked this feature, it's still not here in the PC version."
"I first played this game on a PS3 I borrowed from a friend few years back. I didn't finish it and always regretted it. So when it came out on the PC - Yeah, I'm buying it.  It's a solid port. I've had not technical issues with it.  Biggest problem I have with the game is: The clunky book/chapters out-of-combat interface remained unchanged. I didn't like it in the original game, and was disappointed to see it persist in the PC version.   Smaller issues that may stem from me being me, rather than the game being flawed: Skirmish battles could have had been updated to feature some randomness in opponent behavior or placement. They tend to get boring immediately after the first time you play through them. A faster way to get back into the game after failing a mission would've been good. I currently can't motivate myself to pick the game back up because the idea of failing and needing to repeat the mission(cut-scenes and all) mentally tires me.   And that's the basic way the game progresses after a point. You start a new mission with little to no idea what's going to happen or what you're facing. You fail, naturally. You load the save. Try again with the update to your strategy. And repeat the process until you beat the mission.   I'm just saying, the restarting process could've been faster.  That said.   The game is pretty cool. Turn-based squad battles that are affected by various quirks your soldiers have.  Speaking of soldiers, you don't get as attached to them as you could, if they were given a more robust progression system or more dialog lines, but you do tend to stick with a few favorites that seem to cooperate well.  The story is anime-ish. Take that as good or bad depending on your own opinion on anime/manga. With characters being pretty one-dimensional. But it does serve as a good motivator to keep pushing forward and seeing how it develops.  I do recommend this game for people that fit one or both of the following: Like turn-based games. Like anime/manga."
"So, so, so, so good. Oddly despit its sillyness at time this game tells one of the best and ww2 stories out there. The gameplay is fantastic as well if you enjoy strategy games as I do."
"This is the first time i play a JRPG, and i say..... IT IS A VERY GOOD GAME!!!  This game is not about you shoot each other, dodge an attack like a mouse. But it's more awesome.... If you like a strategy game, but not like long story line, don't play this. If you like Turn based game, but with great storyline and japanese anime style, this game is absolutely for you!!!  (sorry if my review is bad, thanks everyone) :)"
"I've been playing for several hours, and I feel like I'll love this game. It plays like Xcom but with more interesting story and characters, so I highly recommend. (How could I miss this game before? Don't repeat my mistake, whoever you are, BUY IT you won't regret, I guarantee you fun and some brainwork) =)"
"I havent beaten this game yet but so far the story is gripping and the combat is a decent challenge. Anyone who enjoys a good story or wants a challenge would find this game enjoyable. Pros: -Good story -refreshing taste of visuals -Exciting combat -Perma death for non-important characters Cons: -Besides a basic overview nothing is known about enemies on map before fight, leading to some situations where your troops arent equipped to handle a situation. i.e A path of landmines only an engineer can take out but you put your engineer on the other half of your position.  "
"This is one of the best games ever. I don't play turn based strategy much. I also don't play much single-player. Finally, I rarely finish games.  I finished this and still go in to play skirmishes. It is so good. Buy it now :)"
10/10 good game with a great story
"Do you like Strategy? Do you love war? Do you love Anime? Do you love an In depth Story?  If you answered yes for 3/4 of these questions. This Game is Probably for you.  If you answered all of these questions with yes, then your life would be in-complete until you buy and play this game.   Your Objectives: 1: Win the war 2: Save all the Waifus.   Marina is best Waifu."
"I think that this was a very good game to play if you have the time to sit down and enjoy it Pros -Good art -Fun gameplay -fluid controls -Seems to Have a good narrative so far  Cons -Unless you have a VERY good memory then you won't remember some bonuses that the characters have - The actual gameplay doesn't get REALLY good until you get to chapter 4 or 5, which probably takes around a solid hour or so(Could depend on difficulty your playing on)  I would recommend this game also for people who like story rich games, this does require strategy so if you don't like that then i would'nt recommend this for you"
"One of the best JRPGs I have ever played. My one complaint is the AI is generally dumb and you are almost never at risk of losing a mission. But Still the levels are challenging and you are given rewards for finishing missions quickly, so typically you are racing to complete missions in the fastest way possible. The story is excellent. I really got invested. Good work SEGA"
"An excellent turn-based strategic JRPG ! It's again an excellent adaption from game consoles. The universe is rich and the story interesting. Graphics look like you're in an anime and some sort of stuff, and, because of that, really enjoyable and beautiful. Characters are also really appealing, and I couldn't convince myself to let one of them die to get an achievement. Had a lot of fun with this game and will still have some ! Awesome game ! No reason not to buy it !"
"The gameplay of the game is unique yet familiar since it combines the essences of 3 different genres (TBS, RPG and FPS) thus brings an unpredictable and interesting experience to both veterans and newbies. Art, sound and story all do their jobs excellently.  However, I do not recommend the game for people who cannot be patient since the game possesses a tough difficulty which every mistake can cost you a lot of time. (just be patient and try to be relax, the moment you win a really f*** hard mission after 3 hours of attempting is an unforgettable memoir)"
"What should I say?... Valkyria chronicles is the best game of PS3. It has a solid argument, the graphics are beautiful, the game mechanics work really well... it's just AMAZING!  It's a shame Sega didn't design VK2 and VK3 for PS3...  "
This game is pure genius! Would recommend if you love strategy games with good story and characters. The gameplay is simple yet requires you to think more the further you go of course.
"In the past i was a big shooter fan because i liked fast action game play, but did not like strategy games at all till i played this one and i will admit it is one of the very best story rich games i have played in a very long time. if it looks good to you but not a strategy game fan play this game and you would really like if you WWII stuff."
"I am writing from the perspective of someone who played this game when it first came out on PS3 and loved it. I can confirm that I still love it. After all of these years, I had forgotten most of the story and even have to re-learn the combat system, so it's still enjoyable, maybe even more so because of the 60 FPS and 1080p remastering! The DLC is hard...like Dark Souls hard. It's definitely something you should play after you've mastered the game."
Love this game !   Fantastic art style and the story is quite interesting to me. The play style and combat take a bit to get used to but after playing a bit its quite intuitive.   Highly recommended.
"This game has taught me so much about the horrors of war and anime all in one neatly put together JRPG package, 10/10 i wept and had an erection of pride."
"Incredibly fun strategy RPG with a moderate level of difficulty. Own this game for PS3 as well if that says anything about the quality. Another plus is that the game very often goes on sale, at which point it becomes a steal. Very good port that runs even on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rig perfectly and the keyboard/mouse controls seem workable and are changable (although I use a PS3 controller out of habit). Shame the sequels are on PSP."
this game has been one of the best games i have ever played with a rich story line. the game play is hard and challenging and make you think about every move you make. i still have not completed the game so much to do and watch. worth every cent
.
"I've been wanting to play valk chronicles for the longest ever since it was release for the playstation, but i never had a chance to buy it before. Luckily there was a sale recently, persuading me to purchase the game. I've seen dozens of gameplays, but nothing beats playing the game itself.  Cons: A:This game rewards speed rather than strategy B: Game punishes slow gameplay C: You can win a battle with just 1-2 characters   Pros: A: When playing at your pace, it honestly feels like a chess game. B: The game itself has you immersed into a realm of galia vs imperials, making you feel like a commander of your soldiers as the game throws you into a battle. C: The characters have hilarious quotes during the missions."
"If I took more time to write this review, I would have less time to play this game. I prefer to play the game because I like it a lot."
A solid tactics game that blends RPG and action elements. Clearly a port from a console as the camera controls have lead to a few silly combat losses. Menus are clunky. Overall is worth a play through.
wasn't sure if i would like this or not but i am in love with this game
i kill main heroine  10/10 will kill her again
TLDR: Like XCOM? Like anime? Give it a shot.  I played this when it originally came out on the PS3 and now that I'm coming back to it again I feel the game appeal has lost.....absolutely nothing. I still if find it extremely fun and would recommend it to anyone who likes 3rd person tactical RPGs similar to XCOM and Shadow Run Returns. If you like that style of gameplay full of turn based combat and overwatch then this will appeal to you.   What makes this game different is primarily the anime style of the game. It definitely lightens the mood as the core game deals with pretty heavy themes such as racial discrimination and war. Some may say it takes away from the game's emotional impact but I believe if you like anime at all you won't notice it too much.  In this game you have to pick and manage a squad of recruits that you personally choose. Each char has a unique personality and as the leader you will have to figure out the best formations and uses of each party member. It sort of feels like a family as you progress through each challenge as characters can die forever. That said there are are few *important squad members who can't die due to story considerations. I won't lie it's a little wonky that way.  
'World War II: A game of anime tactics' sounds like a great idea? Then Valkyria Chronicles was made for you.  Buy: If you like anime with quirky characters and light tactical gameplay Avoid: If you dislike long cutscenes or any of the above.
"Very nice tactical game. Loved it. Has a lot of manga-style story in it, which can be a bit lengthy if you're just out for the action. Interface is a bit of a drag to learn."
"Very Very interesting game !! I was especially stunned by the way the battle is designed.  i.e. Incorporating the shooting aspect of the game into RPG genre was really really interesting. It was like a new genre of RPG that I have never played before. Story was great with great music ! I would recommend this game to anyone I know. Unless the person is not so leaned towards action based game, the person will enjoy this game! "
"Valkyria Chronicles is an interesting hybrid of turn based + action RPG with strategy elements. The setting is kind of like an alternate earth circa 1930s but with a (finite) wonder element called ragnite which is used pretty much everywhere creating a scarcity which eventually leads to war. The combat is interestingly complex although certain commands can be (ab)used to make a number of the missions incredibly easy. Additionally, the AI can be downright idiotic and you'll often find enemy soldiers charging headfirst into machinegun fire or tanks exposing their weak points to anti-armor while turning to fight a single infantry unit. Plot and characters are kind of weebish but I expected that going into the game. Overall, a fun tactical game worth trying if you're into military-type stuff but don't take it super seriously."
"A turn-based strategy game with a heavy focus on plot shown though cutscenes. Set in a fantasy European world where world war II is more like the cold war, you get to choose a variety of characters ranging from a 12-year old schoolgirl to a dreamy old man. Playing this game really felt like watching an amine while having a long tactical minigame to play in-between episodes.  My main complaint for the game would that there is no way to skip or speed up time during the AI's turn and when the AI has 10 moves to execute the game can slow down immensely. Also graphical glitches in the game never seem to have been fixed, some of the characters decide to wear their bags on their faces.  Worth a try if you don't mind watching cutscenes and sinking some time into the combat portion of the game."
Love It :)
"mix feeling but i will go with a positive evaluation.  First, it is a nice game. Nice graphism, nice story. We can train soldier, upgrade weapons and tanks. A system of turn by turn in which you can control the soldier. You can aim and fire head or body. 5 kind of soldier : scout (rifle), shock trooper (machine gun), lancer (bazooka), engineer (rifle and grenade), sniper. And you can also use a tank.  Seems ok but everything is the same. Capturing the ennemi camp, killing everybody or getting welkin on a certain location. First it is ok, but after few missions, you will find it boring (i want to stop playing this game but i want to see the end of the story. So i keep playing it).  Another bad point is the evalution at the end of the mission. If you want a 'A' (that can be mistaken by a H), you don't need to be silent or killing everybody without getting hurt but you only need to finish quickly the mission. So at the end, if you want to have to top note, you need to run fast at the ennemi camp, kill 1 or 2 ennemi that guard it and capture the camp. Even if you still have 50 ennemi tanks, 5 bunker, 50 troopers, 30 sniper, 5 dead on you side, the hero with 50% of his HP, being see by all the ennemi, you win with a 'A' evaluation.  So you have two way of playing this game, enjoying by killing everybody, being silent, not getting hurt but taking too much time and get a B or C or D at the end (getting less xp and money)  Or you can playing with the same strategy (doing quick and dirty) without so much fun and getting a A evaluation.  However, this game is nice to play with a good story. So i think it ok to buy and play."
5/5
Game mechanics are for intelligent people 18+ years of age. Story is for people 3-5 years of age.  Selvaria &gt; every protagonist in the game.  8/10.
"One of the most enjoyable games I've played in a long time. It has a good art style and graphics, and interesting combat system. However the level design has a number of flaws and can be frustrating at times.  Be sure to use Jann the man (or perhaps woman?), the things he says is hilarious!"
"This game is stupidly long. And not in a good way. In a redoing the map sort of way. Good Game, Good Story, Great Mechanics but expect to be in it for the long haul."
"One of the best games I've played in years. I loved the genre-mashed gameplay, beautiful art style, amazing story, not forgetting the excellent soundtrack as well. This game went way above my expectations."
"Love this game, good strategy, good story, played it on my playstation a lot and just had to have it on steam as well."
"The quasi anime, cel-shaded style should not fit into this World War II reimagination. But it works. It works really well. You will find a lot of references to European situation in 1935-1940 that are very well put into an interesting world. The game is plentiful in content and the game mechanics work really well towards a one of a kind turn based role playing strategy game. If you take out the low resolution pre-rendered cutscenes taken from the Playstation 3 version and no mouse compatibility in the menus you end up with a product that is highly enjoyable with a lenghty 20-30 hours campaign. Shame there are no secrets or anything that would resemble replay value. 87/100."
"This game is amazing. It has everything that a game needs - good scenario and writing, tons of lore, deep touching story, nice anime'ish graphics, memorable characters, intresting and truly unique gameplay mechanics. I would gladly give this game 10 out of 10... but i will not.    The game has a flaw. Just the one single flaw, but it is so huge that it singlehandedly breaks all the immersion, ruins work and talent put into scenario, etc etc. So you are curious what it is? All right, all right, here you go - meet the... *drum-roll* AFTERMATCH SCORING SYSTEM! Now you are probably thinking 'is he crazy? scoring system is a flaw, really? wtf he is talking about?' ok let me explain in detail. FIRST you are sitting in the briefing listening to how bad and desperate the situation are, how there's alot of enemies with heavy equipment, how we already lost some good folks there but we still have to take the enemy camp no matter what, so you have to proceed with caution and may the gods bless you. SECOND - you overbuff your scout with the 'orders' and she leisurely strolls right through the hordes of enemies, while being shot from all sides(Rambo turns green with envy), gets to the enemy camp shoots once or throws a grenade, camp occupied, mission complete. In one or two turns. ONE TURN, CARL! GG CARL! IMMERSION BROKEN, CARL!   You can ask now - but why the heck did you do that? The game allows for the smart and tactical play, you can proceed carefully, while eliminating enemies one by one, caring for your soldiers life and using covers, teamplay, strategy, etc. Yeah, the game allows that. ACTUALLY it is exactly the style i would like to employ, the style which would be perfectly right for this game, falling in place with the narrative. But it is exactly here, where the aftermission scoring system comes in and punches you in the face. The game PUNISHES players for a smart tactical approach. You cleared the mission in 12 turns, while carefully eliminating threats and not allowing any of your soldiers hp drop below 2/3? Pff, sucker, get your lowest possible score, minimum amount of exp and money and ♥♥♥♥ off. You cheerfully strolled right through the bullet hell to the enemy camp surrounded by tanks and enemy soldiers, only to change the red curtain with the blue one in two turns? Yey! Get your A-rank and the maximum amount of exp and money! And all that while being told a dramatic war-story, with pretence of realism in-between the missions. Do you understand now just how much this breaks the atmosphere of the game? And all of that is only because the reward system promotes suicidal overbuffed base-runs instead of the smart tactical approach. If only the system was made to reward players for the maximum number of the enemies eliminated or the minimum number of hp lost - that would be an entirely different story. But we have what we have. I just cannot properly enjoy the battles when my brain is constantly occupied with a single thought 'i have to complete the mission in 3 turns maximum or i will be punished by the game with exp-cutting'   In the perfect world where the rating systems are made with accordance to the genre and story that game would have a 10 out of 10 score.   But breaking the players immersion is a heavy sin, so as it is - it's 7/10   Though i would still recommend it anyway. The gameplay is really interesting and unique, and if you can tolerate being punished for the tactical playstyle in what is supposed to be a tactical game - you will have alot of fun with it."
"I love a game that can challenge me, this does just that. You must think tactically to get through without losses. Lovely artwork and great voice acting lets you become really absorbed by the game and really get into the story. The game will take a while to play with saving a lot throughout, but well worth it."
"A fantastic game. Mixing wonderfully drawn, anime style characters &amp; storyline with surprisingly deep and fun, turn-based strategy and a considerable action component. Its hard to believe a game that looks and plays this good was released so many years ago originally. The music is also fantastic. Its honestly SEGA at its best. If you like JRPGs and strategy games you will love this game! I really hope this game sells like crazy so they do a PC port of the 2nd game. And maybe we'll even get the 3rd game in english! (I've read that the 3rd game is even better than the first!)"
"its a good game i played it on PS3 , and loved it , there are a few little problems with the port but other wise its good"
"Bought this gem on sale not knowing what to expect. It's a turn base game much like X-Com but with a great story line and the music is so frickin awesome. It's got X-box controller support, one of the main reasons why I bought this game and it runs pretty descent on my ( quite ancient ) Acer Laptop. ( on lower setting, but still looks awesome )  I totally fell in love with this style.  So if you like anime and want to take part in a great story, buy this game, on sale it's a steal !! But its totally worth its full price too."
"it is an awesome game, the art work for this game is beautiful and the story line is complex but tells you everything you need to know for it not to be too much for people, the battle system is brilliant how it goes from map view right into the thick of it in the battle. I totally recommend this for anyone who is a fan of games like fire emblem and advanced war."
"This is a great game, if you are a fan of turn based strategy games you won't be disappointed. The classes, leveling up system, weapon enhancements, and tank upgrades give the game a nice RPG feel to it. The characters are appealing and the story is good enough to keep you interested. I much preferred the actual gameplay is a much bigger draw than the story."
John DiMaggio plays a gay anti-tank soldier 10/10 Plus the game's pretty good
"Mixes turn-based squad strategy (XCOM) with real-time third person combat (every TPS ever) and random accuracy (S.T.A.L.K.E.R), while delivering it under the guise of WW2 Kawaii Edition + Feels.  Surpassed my expectations by a very far shot. And, as some of you know, my standards for a good game tend to be pretty high. This is pretty much the only game which made it into my top 3 of all time within 24 hours of buying it."
"Like a gentler more RPGy, slightly real-time X-Com."
'Fire Emblem: World War II'!!!!!
"This game is just like the PS3 version. A few minor quirks, but it is a real good game. Hint: Never overwrite your game file with DLC missions. I have to start back from scratch. I was on Chapter 12. Oh well. It's a great game nontheless."
"I have played valkyria chronicle 1 and 3. Loved it, but still not satisfied from my opinion...need more story and character interaction!  10/10 for japanese voice acting + english subtitle option.  Looking forward to valkyria chronicle 3 PC version and possibly next sequel."
"This one have a great innovative gameplay and art! The only bad thing about it is this port; taking ladders or elevators may cause your character to drop till hell literally. They keep falling down through the ground, becoming useless and taking space on the map until he/she retreats."
You can drive tanks. 11/10
"I played the sequel of the game on PSP before. Compared to it, it can be considered less perfect. But nevertheless a great game and one of my favorite series. Hopefully they have the sequel released in Steam too."
"great game, good story, anime story line"
"I like the story and the animation is compelling. Its more like a graphic novel than an 'anime' cartoon you might see in a show, but i'm not an expert so you should judge for yourself. My only complaint is the port from console to computer would have made me happier if tank driving controls were not so incredibly bad. But overall I really like this game and I would definitely recommend it."
"I love this kind of game, lots of choices and strategy. I give it eight Whoopie Goldbergs out of eight."
"I used to play the VC2 and VC3 in PSP and I'm so glad that this edition can be played in PC.  The system of battle is awesome because there is many element that need be considered like strategy, move method and attract target. It can be played by controller. It is a little difficult than VC2 and VC3 cas the role will not revive once it died in the war.  The style of image is ink and wash painting, I like that. The English version is not so good. This version should be translated by Japanese version but many sentences is not always the same meaning with original one.  The story is about how cruel the war is and the love and friendship between the partners.Typical Japanese story. :)"
"I loved the storyline and animated quality is like super awesome in this game. the game has much to offer besides the main story missions like skirmishes, side story missions and challenging DLC content.  but most important reason you should get this game is Selvaria don't worry you will see why and agree with me"
"An excellent blend of visual novel-style storytelling and tactical RPG combat; I loved almost everything about this game.  The characters and story-telling were fantastic. The plot and setting were both familiar, yet with an interesting twist about them. I loved the character bios for each squad member that were unlocked as each member rose to some degree of prominence (as you used them in combat). The love story between the leads was top-notch, and felt very organic. The villains felt like real human beings, with their own good and bad qualities to them. And the epilogue was perfect.  The combat and RPG mechanics also worked very well. The game throws a variety of different maps and objectives at you; everything from kill them all, to capture the flag, to protect your base, to simply surviving until help arrives. The units complement each other well. And there are interesting strategic choices to be made between battles, especially about which weapons to equip on which soldiers.  My only complaint about the game is the menu navigation. Exiting the game is a bit tedious (go to title screen, press a key to go to menu, and then select exit game). And some of the menu interface choices are a bit non-intuitive.  Still, those are small issues with what is otherwise an excellent game. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who likes tactical RPGs or good story-telling."

"10/10  - Good story - Good Character development - Lovely story  - Hard at times but worth the grind  - Unique game play  - Amazing and unique art   I have to admit as much as Ive become the ADHD generation, the amount of, time, thought, experiment and effort invested into this game was well worth the gaming experience. Having to work so hard to survive in tough battles really rewards. Wished they had more strategy stages involved (like chapter 7 lol...) instead of rewarding Alicia rushing as an A rank play. Other than the game play I have to admit Im also very fond of the characters in this game and how they were used to develop the story. Great game overall!"
"Not only was the actual anime good, but the game is never ending fun if your a strategy fan!"
"I think I put enough time into this game to give a fair review.  On the whole, this is an enjoyable turn-based strategy JRPG. However the 'strategy' part of this game is somewhat unconventional. It rewards you for fast completion over anything else. This can mean running one character past all of the enemies, soaking up bullets along the way just to reach the objective and get an A rank. That aside, the combat is still decent.  Pros: - Good story - Great setting - Enjoyable characters (host of voice actors) - Decent gameplay - Hours of content  Cons: - Some long and overdrawn cutscenes (but skippable) - Rewards speed vs proper strategy - Upgrade system is annoying and unnecessary - Controls are iffy on the PC, use a controller is possible  Worth playing 7/10"
"Nice game on console, finally on PC, give it a go if you've not played the PS3 version. It's a very hard game that requires good tactics and its got an interesting story to drive it along."
great game. u should try it
its a fantastic game with deep mechanics and a mature story despite its presentation. well worth playing however do note its not easy and will make you think before each turn.
"Amazing game, hope they port 2 and 3 at some point."
"I got nothing to say beyond, if you like anime, strategy and engaging story, get this. Seriously."
After just 15 minutes a cute anime girl gave me a big ♥♥♥ bag of bread best game ever
+Excellent (Turn-based) (No-grid) Strategy Game +Great Characters +Own game mechanics +Nice 'Hand-drawn Style' Visuals +/- Play with a controller
Must Play WW2 era RPG!
"This game lacks mouse-driven menus.  Now that the bad is out of the way...  They may be more games like this out there, but I'm not aware of any. Essentially, what you're looking at here is a third-person shooter/turn-based RPG. On your turn you get to move one character at a time across the field in a third person perspective and then perform an action (e.g. use a weapon or item). After you're out of action points, the AI gets their turn doing the same thing. You form your strategy with a selection of soldiers that each has a class and certain traits (both positive and negative) which you can level up while also purchasing better weapons and equipment for your troops and tanks.  An aspect that'll likely split some people is the story/cutscenes. Each 'chapter' of the story includes one -- occasionally two -- missions and several cutscenes/dialogue sequences of varying length. This might become a bit of an annoyance for those who don't care about the story. Some cutscenes are completely by-passable and, truth be told, you may be able to skip the ones you're supposed to watch. I've never tried so I can't say for sure.  All in all, it's a solid TPSTBSJRPG thingy so if it sounds like it's up your alley, I'd certainly give it a try."
"This is easily one of the best strategy games of the last decade, and has aged incredibly well, thanks to its impressive artwork and extremely high-quality PC port. (There are enough graphics settings built into this PC version that you can bring its in-game graphics up to higher resolutions and not lose any of the original artistic charm.)  The gameplay is somewhere between a Final Fantasy Tactics-style turn-based strategy and a third person shooter, where all of the movement and action plays out in semi-real-time, keeping things tactical without making them boring. This is, ultimately, a game about crossing battlefields full of shooters, and they've woven the turn-based 'frozen moment' paradigm into tactical considerations like line-of-sight, cover, and suppressing fire extremely gracefully. It's not an action game by any stretch, but you'll even simple things like moving your troops to be appropriately dangerous and, hopefully, exciting.  There's a satisfying strategic element to your general campaign as well, where you spend money and experience to outfit and level up your army, which is meaningful enough to help your war efforts, but simple enough that there's no agonizing per-unit leveling (like Final Fantasy Tactics, in particular) to mire the whole level-up process. You level entire classes of units at once, with every unit of that class treated equally. Seemingly small touches like these ward off some of the leveling agonies of other tactical RPGs in a single gesture.  The story is quite good, even though it's probably not the primary strength of the game. It's a overarchingly WW2-themed war story -- generic enough to seem universal, but specific enough with individual moments, characters, and themes that it still tells an interesting story about an interesting set of characters. It can even be quite touching at times, and occasionally heavy or somber. (There are a few silly moments too, but it's still well on the straighter-faced side of anime-style storylines.)  Lastly, the Hitoshi Sakimoto soundtrack keeps a familiar feel to his other work (again, Final Fantasy Tactics, and FFXII, etc.), and sets a solid tone for the game's many moods.  This has been one of the main games that completely justified my PS3 purchase years ago, and it's only a stronger product today on PC. If you are any degree of strategy or tactical-RPG fan, this game is one of the best of its class. Here's hoping the Steam successes it might find would inspire Sega to revisit the IP."
"The feels hit me harder then a truck. I got 2 tears in my eyes by the end of the game. One for the story, second for the gameplay. And a warm feeling in my stomach for the art style. Oh and maybe that nice cozy feelings for the well written characters.  Well played SEGA, well played.  'salutes 7th squad'"
Amazing graphics! Very cool play
"Besides some really stupidly, stupidly... stupidly enacted forced developements for emotional scenes inside the story - actually prevented me from having said emotional scene in light of the way it came to be - the game is solid. If you can live with hitboxes being sometimes bigger than the visuals - especially walls - and you like nerve-racking strategic puzzles, the later bullet dive and CP conserving challenges will entertain you quite a bit. But expect to sometimes savescum for that one shot. Luckily this game supports this quite well, unless you are trapped in your enemies turn. No way to halt this or load in it. I did the Splintered Horn achievement last without saving, which is my only major flaw aside of mishaps in the story and their 'explanation', you get an achievement for losing. I don't like to be forced to kill people, even for one mission.  This game gets my rating of:  Finish it or Complete it. It was worth the Summer Sale price and I dare say if you like such games, it is worth the normal price too."
"Unique gameplay structure is refreshing and fun as well as an interesting anime-ish story to follow with keeping pace with team management and equipment selection for personalizing your interchangable roster of troops. Some parts can be icky with menu controls and graphical setups common among console ports, but nevertheless the game is catching and enjoyable for its price."
"Valkyria Chronicles is an excellent game, and if you have any interest in strategy games whatsoever you will probably love it. It has a respectable story, with an excellent artstyle and music to boot!  However, there are some things that make the game a bit finnicky to play. FIrstly, mouse and keyboard controls are thoroughly mediocre. I got fed up with them and switched to playing the game with a gamepad, which is what it was designed for in the first place. Additionally, no matter what controler I used, I found it rather difficult to steer tanks while going in reverse. This was by no means gamebreaking, but it certainly was a point of frustration. Also, being able to fast-forward through enemy turns would have greatly improved the experience, as in the game's present form you will spend a lot of time sitting and doing nothing."
"The characters trend to be awfully one dimension, especially the main character. (One of the other characters even comments on how one dimensional he is.) If you can manage to choke down the story the gameplay is very entertaining though and well worth the effort. Just make sure you don't care the ratings it gives you as getting 'A's' forces you to just blitz scouts around the map rather than playing for fun."
"It's a turn-based strategy game. It has a compelling story line, great characters, fun easter eggs, and teaches gamers the importance of using certain units to counter others, Shocktrooper beats Scout, Scout beats Sniper, Sniper beats Lancer, Lancer beats Tank, and Tank beats everything (Shocktroopers, cause they're everywhere). But it also teaches you strategy, you have to scout the map in order to concoct a plan to defeat your enemy with zero casualties. Your soldiers can die in the line of duty (not ones marked with a Star). All-in-all, it's fun, enraging, and set in the future with WWII tech."
"As a long time veteran of X-COM and of Long War mods, i was seeking a new challenge and tried valkyria chronicles. The game itself isnt bad: the story is nice and its new take on WWII is quite original. However, the combat is way to simplistic for my taste. I will stick to xcom for now."
love this game for 90% of its content but my only personal would like to sees for this game would be 1. multiplayer 2. more equipment for versatility 3. a market system for the multiplayer in question  4. add new features and functions such as melee and new vehical types for multiplayer three is kinda somewhat complicated considering steam... but i was thinking we should be able to earn credits for fighting other players and such and then being able to purchase all types of units and gear for those units in a market in game and being able to use steam money to boost you up a little.  and i know making new models and functions to the game does take some time but its avaliable and im pretty sure everyone who's enjoyed this game knows what i mean but this would give the devs the ability to make so more money and give us a huge bonus and a new level of enjoyment &amp; playability for this game after you beat god knows how many times right?
"The tanks are so powerful that the letters 'RRRRRRRR' come out of the engines and the explosions are so intense the word 'BOOM!' is created out of the flames. And most of my army consists of people between 12 and 17 years of age.  10/10 for combat realism.   On a more serious note, it's a very fun game for people who like things like XCOM, but without the more rigid unit movemen. It's even similar to Tom Clancy's End War, except it's turn based. It starts out relatively easy but very quickly becomes a challenge and requires some actual planning for where to move your units and what tool to use. Sometimes it's hard to choose between fixing a tank and landing that final shot on an enemy, so you've gotta make your decisions wisely in the middle of combat. I'd definitely recommend this game for anyone who'd like to try a strategy game of a different variety."
"This game has been made in a very seductive way, and it's quite prized by the community, but it's not that great. After a few moments of a quite fast learning curve, you will face thousands of cutscenes in and out of the action. It get's tiresome really fast, especially when you have to deal with bugs and poor design. I found myself saving and loading each turn, not because my strategy was bad, but because there is too many variables of luck. A headache, not that much fun."
Very nice strategy game with a rich and deep story ^u^
Great game one of a few where I can to become attached to the characters would recomend to anyone!
"I've played video games for 12 years and this is one of my favourite. Looks beautiful, and it's always challenging. Great story too!   A sure recommendation."
"I loved to play the sequel to this game on my psp and now i have finally picked up this beautifull gem. Thus far, I have enjoyed: the story, the elegant combat system and the difficulty curve. Although, I should warn you that a substantial amount of the game is dialogue, though this need not matter; the characters are interesting and have lots of depth.  My last mission that I attempted ended in my tank charging forward; there was no resistance other than measly scouts ready to be harvested for thier souls :)  Then this lancer (anti-tank) comes out of a prone position from some shrubbery and launches his ♥♥♥♥♥ missile into my tank's radiator (weak-spot)  10/10 would let my tank get surprised anal from rambo"
"Being use to tatical rpgs such as Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tatics, I went in to this game expecting something very similar. I was very surprised on how different this game was to other tatical rpgs. With the third person view you get while controlling each character to how you level up classes and not individual characters this game is massively fun and something I highly reccomend to people who are fans of the genre. Not to say the game doesn't have it's faults. I find it a bit annoying with the amount of cutscenes in the game, I've only played for about 3 or 4 hours and I feel like 2 hours of it is cutscenes."
"It's a pretty fun turn based game, enjoyed it very much. It's a bit slow at first, and there are no enemy skip's but hey patience is a virtue."
"While I haven't completed the campaign yet, I wanted to leave a bit of feedback for Valkyria Chronicles:  The good: I'm having a lot of fun with this game. It has certain unrealized potentials, to be sure, but on the whole it's a positive experience. The overview strategic/third person hybrid gameplay generally works quite well. Some of the percieved depth of character/unit customization turns out to be a bit pointless, with a lot of useless weapon options and poor troop options you'll never use (IMHO, of course), but the strategy is more about how you deploy/utilize/synergize your units than how you set them up.  The bad: As others have pointed out, the tanks control like absolute garbage. Not sure why this particular aspect of the game was ported so badly, but there you go. I've found ways to work around the issue, but it still impacts the functionality of your key unit(s) in most battles.  All in all, this was a solid purchase and I feel like I've already gotten my money's worth out of it, even part-way through. The story is deep and enjoyable, but perhaps a bit cumbersome and heavy-handed for some looking for a pure strategy experience. I would recommend this title to any strategy buffs who also enjoy the odd JRPG."
"Very well made and visually beautiful game. It does tend to be a bit difficult, but never becomes too frustrating."
I had this for ps3. My ps3 died before i finished the game. This is soooo much better on pc as the loading times are so minimal. Everyone must play this game!
"A great mix of turn based strategy and action gameplay. Highly recommended  Pros.   A well fleshed out story and characters. And I don`t mean only the main cast as well. As a great addition I see a great characterization of the secondary squad members. The way they do it is through the appearance, combat shouts and interactions with the game world and other squad members. It works to a great extent and it does not feel ham fisted, like jamming unnecessary actors in cut scenes. This is something I don`t see all that often done in such games and find it a shame :( This serves as a great example of how to do it right.  Combat is an interesting mix of turn based and action gameplay. While in the tactical view it acts as a standard turn based game, but when taking control of a character it starts to feel more like an action game. This is due to the interception mechanic, while you move your character around, enemy troops with a line of sight and range will be firing on you. It gives a great deal of tension to the action, since you must act fast and precise while still thinking of the overall strategy involved, of course your troops also have interception fire, which gives additional tactical importance to the position and the direction your troops are facing at the end of your turn.  Something to add is the tone of the narrative. While presented in a colorful and distinct anime style it does not shy away from darker parts of war, like forced labor camps and the stronger world powers using the smaller nations for their own gain.  Cons.  I found tank controls to be janky at best while using keyboard and mouse, especially after performing an action. To my understanding it was due to the fact that the way tank was facing and camera were pointing were different. What makes it even more irritating is the fact that tanks use AP (Action points) to turn as well as to move(unlike infantry), meaning you might end up facing the wrong way and leaving your weak points exposed to the enemy, because it took too long to regain control over the unit.  Some of the maps and missions feel a bit too gimmicky. While I see the notion of providing different game experiences at times it felt like the AI is straight up cheating or putting arbitrary restrictions on your possibilities. These missions made sense in narrative, but were underwhelming or frustrating in terms of gameplay.  Menus don`t have mouse control, which I found annoying.  "
Draft 10 kawaii girl for my team   10/10 - Would draft it again
"Love it from start to the end, give me the same feeling than playing fire emblem series, but with more space to control the units. great art style, lovable characters, good story the only cons i can think is that IS punishing but that exactly wath i was looking for in this game ten of a ten C:"
"The gameplay is fun, if you can get past the horrible cutscene dialogue and souldcrushing soundtrack."
"Great Game for a Great Price. Totally Worth, I hope some say VK2 and 3 are on PC too. There's an anime about this game too, so if you like it check that out!"
"32.1 hours on record, and i've only beaten the main storyline.  This game is one of the better turn based strategy games i've played.  The whole layout of this game is great, from the HQ upgrading your tank and soldiers to the actual bouts that you have with the enemy. I love being able to see that my upgrades are visually upgrading my loadouts and not just adding an invisible buff you will never physically see. The action is fast paced for a turn based strategy game, your units arent just stoicly letting an enemy run right up into their face and unload, they will fire at anyone who gets into their range and sightline. I enjoyed the story, there were some times where I thought it was moving to quickly but it didn't bother me to the point where i couldn't play.  Story 9/10 -felt too fast at points -well written and engaging  Gameplay 9/10 -Very fluid and the free roam aspect to it added some flavor -you're never overpowered which helps keep the game challenging and engaging -Luck has a small fator in aiming and firing at enemys, but its not detrimental. -Allows a certain degree of freedom in the way you play, checks and balances are the only thing really holing you back in terms of playing the way you want (at least if you want to keep everyone alive)  Visuals 9/10 -I love the art style this game was crafted in -actually seeing upgrades is a personal taste in which I enjoy quite a bit -It has little words that pop up ingame while doing certain things (Kaboom for an explosion, rumbling text for engines and the like). It's quirky and enjoyable -It's also a game, not an anime so dont expect god tier animation. I digress, its still really well done for a game.  Overall 9/10 -Enjoyable and engaging story, check -Well done visuals, check -Fluid and nonrestricting gameplay, check  Last note, not being able to speed up time for the enemys turn is a bit of a pain sometimes but it helps run the game at a steady pace so its not a huge deal to myself. Could be annoying to others. "
Really enjoyable with a rich story. Dlc is included which makes it an amazing deal.
Getting rekt beacuse you are bad at strategy games simulator 2014/10
"Been looking for a new good game to play, found this, no need to search anymore."
"This game brought me to buy a PS3 when it was still exclusive more or less exclusively based on concept and style alone. Did not, and do not regret it one bit. I love this game and I pray for a glorious day where the other game(s?) are available on PC as well."
"Its good, really good and right now with this summer sale fever you can get it crimanally cheap. I actually feel dirty getting this for like 2-3 bucks actually thinkin of going to confession on what a steal it was but anyway enough about that, Valkyria Chronicles deserves that very positive rating it has on steam. Valkyria's story is simple but told spectacular, voice acting has done a phenomenal job on both english and japanese voices (yes you can switch between the two anytime you want) it even has little nuances like echoes when the characters are in caves. The missions are actually quite diffficult the first time one plays it and the generic characters you bring with you each have their own personality and bios too. My only real complaint with this game is that speed is what matters in this game so if you want that S rank or A you gotta finish as fast as you can which makes sense until you realize you aren't penalized on anything else. It doesn't matter if all but one of your squad dies or you didn't kill a single soildier or you applied Art of war teachings or massacered an entire battalion with nothing but 3 men, nothing else really matters as long as you finish in as few turns as possible. A minor annoyance really but highly counter intuitive for a strategy game.  I must say though that playing with a controller is a must as this is a port from a console game there are some port issues the biggest annd most annoying (though it might or might not happen depends on your luck) is controlling your tank with a mouse. Its pretty bad but fixable with the senstivity changes, still controller"
"Played for three chapters without saving, before quitting because a character died and I didn't know how to get the medic.  10/10 would do again because this game is friggin' awesome."
"Amazing story, unique and fun gameplay, great characters, awesome music and visuals that hold up to todays games. This is just the start of what you'll be experiencing when you play this game. I played this game back when it was only on PS3, and enjoyed it so much that i had to buy it and support the game on steam. You should check it out too."
"Really great game thus far. It reminds me a lot of Fire Emblem, except with guns and tanks etc.  If you enjoy Fire Emblem types of RPG fighting games, I honestly recommend this game. Heck I recommend it for everyone really, it's tons of fun and you just fall in love with the characters. I look forward to wasting countless hours of my life playing this game as I have with Fire Emblem Awakening"
"At first sight it looks like a promising game especially if you like the anime series of the same title, but the game mechanics are outdated, graphics are old and gameplay is really really a torture, and all the menu animations in betweeners make you lose tons of time as you try to pass from one episode to another, the menu system really tortures your nerves trying to switch from one menu to another eughhh it's tiring. It's like you're trying to play a PS game on PC, we dont need this crap. And on top of all NO AUTOSAVE. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it I dont know how many hours of gameplay I lost due to that. I definitely dont recommend this game, its a big waste of money."
"The amount I played was good ... up untill a tank showed up, and every cinamatic and every character that volume can't be lowered and a forever on max (rip my ears) and there are more was to fail a mission than pass one"
Good port of a very good game.
"Played it on the ps3 back then; still a top-notch strategy game, albeit a little hard at the start but still fun as ♥♥♥♥. 8/10  also Marina best waifukiller"
"Main protagonist as a tank commander? ...Check! Top-tier bakery waifu, also as a main protagonist? ...Check! Ability to assemble a squad of waifus? ...Check! XCOM-like Turn-based combat? ...Check! High-quality PC Port ...Check! Great Story? English/Japanese selectable voice acting? Unique art style? ...Check, check, and...check!  Seriously, what are you waiting for???  "
"The game is wonderful, enjoy the artstyle and the narrative; My only problem is it seems to have quite a few graphical issues (they don't really effect anything, but just letting the fact be known)"
"Valkyria Chronicles was one of the first games that I bought on PS3, and to this date I still don't think there has been a better game published on that console. The game features solid mechanics, story, and aesthetics, and with a decent length is one of the most complete experiences in gaming.  The PC version manages to make replaying the game a fresh experience by eliminating the restrictions of the PS3. The game is no longer hobbled by atrocious load times, and the update to 1080p resolution is a massive improvement on already fantastic visuals.   I do recommend playing with a gamepad, as Sega didn't do quite a great job with translating the game's original controls to a mouse and keyboard scheme. This is unfortunate, because the game really does fine in action mode with shooter controls, but the map navigation being tied to the movement keys in action mode make it a little too awkward of an experience for me. The sniper zoom is also too slow with mouse controls, making a key binding necessary if you choose to use the keyboard.  The core game design is solid, but does have some problems.  The first is the ranking system. Rank on a mission is tied only to the number of turns it took to clear the mission. This is fine if you are a low turn clear type of player, and it is also fine if you don't want to care about rank and clear at your own pace, but there is no real middle ground.   Because you cannot replay past story chapters, if you want to A rank all the missions you have to speed run every chapter. This isn't very difficult, but it does mean that A ranking missions requires you to play in a specific way that isn't necessarily more fun. In particular, the movement advantage of the scout class is so extreme that shocktroopers, engineers, and tanks are almost completely unused except in the few missions that force you to use them in some way or another.  My recommendation is to do your first playthrough not caring about rank and just enjoying all the things the game and it's unique classes have to offer - the game is easy enough such that the lost EXP for not A ranking is not really an issue. It does however suck that the game forces you to do multiple playthroughs if you want to A rank and 'have fun.'  The other issue I have with this game is power creep. Power creep is in general a problem with every SRPG I've played, but in Valkyria, it hits as soon as your scouts hit level 11. Once your units are upgraded to elites, the enemies never really catch up in strength. It can be fun to run around maps with relatively overpowered units, but in an SRPG, difficulty is something to be valued as well. You can keep the difficulty artificially higher by not leveling up your units, but it would have been nice if the difficulty scaled appropriately as your team gains more resources naturally.  Do these cons outweight the pros? Absolutely not. The game is beautiful, fun, and has great characters. If you only want to play hard games, then you're missing out on a lot."
Goes from being a decent anime story to a tactical squad real time turn based thing... and its surprisingly fun and satisfying to set your peices just right and plow through the enemy team in one turn.
Stunning visuals. Beautiful soundtrack. Addictive gameplay and strategy. Like Final Fantasy Tactics.

This game is X-com with a japanese style.
"Played it multiple times on the PS3, port is very good, though Keyboard controls are a bit strange. Hooked up controller and performs perfectly. 1/2 way through the game this time and no issues at all. 10/10 would recommend."
"I love.This game.I outright just love it.I love the artwork,It's great.And the story as well.The story makes actual sense in conjuction to some of it if you think hard enough.And it's steampunky feeling is good as well.Gameplay is a little clunky as it gets alot harder in the last few 'parts' though i very much like the game.I recommend it to some who are quite hardcore and a completist."
"I have so much I would like to say about this game. I enjoyed it in so many different ways. Somehow it managed to push all my emotional and game-play buttons. I was surprised at how emotionally attached and involved I became with the game in the course of playing it.   I would easily recommend this game as a must play to most of my friends. The story is quite good, the mechanics are fun and intersting, the levels are fairly well designed.  I have some minor gripes with the game: 1) some of the boss fights are, in my mind, a real weakpoint. The strength of this game lies in the large, open tactical battles, rather than just desperatly trying to hammer away at one OP unit until you find the specific exploit needed to defeat it. 2) I doubt it will be very replayable because I won't be able to reexperience the level of emotional invovlement on a rerrun (Although with 48h of gameplay it's still very good value)(For some reason the game things I only put 28h into the save, not sure whats up)"
An amazing story so far can't wait to get further into it!!! 5/5
"Valkyria Chronicles is a fantastic JRPG set in Europe. The general pacing of the game was fantastic, a good mix of combat and story blended togeather very well. The story is very well portrayed, and the characters have likable personalities and flaws which helps them grow as a character. Combat is fun and never feels old, the mission variety and design are very well done. I only found a few of the later missions frustrating. Overall, a great JRPG that really should be played by anyone who loves the genre."
"Played this game on the ps3 and the port is done nicely.  -the gameplay is still awesome, didnt take long to get used to the new controls (suggest changing the close button from ESC to something thats closer)  -Story its a hit or miss, to me its ok but the gameplay really is why im even playing this again  -Design: the menu design is still the same, not that great, but the battle ui is really good.  What u waiting for? Defend galia from the scumbag imps NOW!!!"
"Band of Brothers in Japanese turn based combat gameplay anime style art and cinematics form. Many manly tears will be shed. An amazing game. Those who never had a console should praise the sun that this game now exists on PC. If you don't like the game, you don't even deserve this game anyway."
"This game is just perfect! A mix of RPG, JRPG, Strategy, Anime-like graphics and great &amp; lovable characters. Addictive and very rewarding! Get it while it's still on sale!"
" Notification: I currently didn't finishd the game, so it's just an 'First impression' Review.   At the begining you see an 'Trailer' of the story. The eastern european empier (Sowjet Union) fights against the western europen republic (Nazi Germany OR the Allieds of the cold war) for some rare resources, in totaly not World War II, and in the middle is an neutral country. This neutral country, totaly not finland, get's attacked by the Empire and you need to strike back. You take the role of a guy how wants to be teacher, but how wants to protect his motherland too. So you get a tank from your (maybe dead, Idk) father as a gift. This totaly not Tiger 2, lookalike, tank you received is now your main commander (with your protagonist ofc). Now you have to fight againt the the totaly not Sowjet Union to free you homecountry.   This review will get a continue soon  "
"Amazing story which draws you in and really fleshes out the main characters. The level of lore put into the game is amazing, which gives you a great sense of the world, its factions and even individual people.  Enjoyable battle system with a few quirks that I wish they didnt have ie enemy crouched behind a sandbag, you on same side standing point blank behind them and it still confers the bonus as if your on the other side.  Also I think they could add more factors into the ranking system for missions. I originally started up playing 'smart' avoiding damage and taking things sensibly. Earning myself a load of D Rankings. The only thing that matters is how quickly you can finish, you can lose nearly all your troops so long as you finish fast you will earn an A Rank. Can someone say ZERG RUSH!  Despite this I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good storyline or Tactical RPGs. You wont regret buying this game."
"After almost 40 hours played I'm still not tired of this game. I love the setting, gameplay, and the art style. Those three elements have me hooked on this game. Characters are intersting and memorable. The story is decent and entertaining enough but not great.  "
War Never Changes: Anime Edition
"I find this game extremely hard to review. On the one hand you have a really nice tactical semi-turnbased RPG. But between these gameplay segments are some of the most cringe-worthy anime cutscenes I've ever seen. Truthfully, I'm really not into the Japanese animation style, although I enjoy a Gibli flick once in a while, so maybe I'm just not the target demographic. But the music, the voice acting and 'emotional moments' in the story are, ahem... 'so not me'. I nearly gave up on the game, then decided to switch over to the original Japanese voices with subs, which somewhat lessened my annoyance with the story-telling. I will probably try to continue playing it a bit more, possibly by skipping the many, many, many, many, many (did I say many?) cutscenes. But overall I find this game very hard to recommend because of this. Still, opinions are like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, so if you are a proper Weeaboo and like strategy, RPGs or any combination of these you might very well think this game amazing.  One final comment: while the port is robust enough in itself, what the hell where they thinking by not having a mouse in the menu's!?"
"Strategy game with a twist. An excllent port from PS3 takes alittle getting used to, but once you get the controls and strategy down its barely noticable. Plays alot a fire emblem or advanced wars but with a full 3-D enviroment to fight in and on. With a surprisingly deep story this game has an excellent art style and premise. If you like any anime or JRPG games then you will likely enjoy this. As you fight for a small country in a fictional alternate world version World War II.  9/10 occassional glitches with menu and videos are the only thing that prevent this from being a 10"
"Disclaimer: I have not yet completed the game, it's storyline, nor it's DLCs.  Never having owned a PlayStation console, this would be one of my first experiences with a PlayStation game.  Valkyria Chronicles... is interesting. The emotional story of (note my disclaimer) wanting to save their beloved town from the impending attack. God damn Imperials. Go die.  From what I've played so far, a few things could be adjusted: - Mouse support in menus. Like, why not? Having to use arrow keys AND enter is too much for me. - Fix buggy movement. Pressing 'W' once, then holding it down will cause the character to walk, stop, and then continue walking. This can cause certain death in certain situations.  Other than those so far, I'd say the game and it's progression is really nice. Recommended to those who enjoy this genre (see tags)"
"I am not one who normally likes anime. I don't watch it, yet I don't judge people who do. That said, when I saw this, I was drawn in by the weird World War 1/2 aesthetic, and once I started playing, I couldn't stop. First and foremost, the soundtrack, voice acting, and sound effects are great, especially the soundtrack. I have sat and listened to the soundtrack while I play other games, muting them so I can hear this more. I promise, if you buy this you WON'T be disappointed.  Imagine Fire Emblem, a mashup soundtrack of Ace Combat and Kingdom Hearts, and RWBY all put together. That's this game. It's absolutely fantastic and has earned a spot as one of my favorites of all time, easily making my personal top 5 list."
"The game is fantastic. It's a unique concept that I hadn't seen before, and while the story can be cheesy at times, it's interesting and heartwarming.   As a port, it feels a bit lazy. The controls feel off. It should have allowed you to use the mouse in menus. Instead, the only time the mouse can be used is when aiming during missions, and if that weren't the case, I'd just say buy the game for playstation instead. Even then, since the game gives you time to line up your shots, the only advantage to using the mouse is saving time.   The game comes with the dlc, which personally, I thought was meh, but worth a try. I'm hoping we can see the sequel released on Steam as well, with better controls, and I'm still hoping to see the third game come to North America."
"The godawful controls, half-♥♥♥♥♥ port, inherently flawed mechanics, and stupid bugs make this altogether not worth playing."
Great game for fans of Fire Emblem. Although this is the kind of game that starts off pretty easy then goes 0-100 real quick.
"Story is ok, battles become so repetitive."
"A lovely sort of Fantasy world war 2 turn based strategy game  Has a very competent and very fun battle system with challenging missions.  You will assemble a crack Regiment of anime guys and gals devived into different classes with their own names and personallity and distint look that do have an effect in battle.  The game's plot is told in fully voice acted cutscenes that can be listen to in both English and Japanese with subtitles.   There are two option menus one acessible from in game that will alow you to tinker with the sensitivity controls and sound volumes. With the other option menu being only accessable outside the game for graphical performance options and there arn't many options to play with other than resolution options, vsync and screen aspect ratios but the game will be in letterboxed for monitors that are not 16:9 aspect ratios. also to change key bindings to play with mouse and keyboard or with a controller with xbox 360 button prompts.  The battle system in the game is a turn base system simular to Hogs of War if you've played that game. Each turn you have a number of command points and with each command point you can spend control one of your soldiers with this they have you can move anywhere on the the battlefield up until you have depleated their movement meter and one action each turn such as shooting, throwing grenades and more and you do these at any point during your turn. so you can have a guy move all his distance shoot the enemy or you could shoot first and runaway or move a bit shoot then move again all with one command point. i like that, allows you to do hit and run the enemy but the enemy during your turn can react to you but so can your guys. not only do you have infantry to play with but also have tanks these consume two command points to use but While slow and cumbersome they do deliver the big guns and armoured against light weapons but watch out the enemy have tanks and anti armour weapons of their own so to fight you with. And should any of your war faring fellows be cut down you can save them by rushing another character to them that will allow the medic to evactuate them from the battlefield but should you fail to do that the will die and they don't come back from that.  As you progress through the campaign you will gather Experience and cash to spend on improving your characters classes and equipment.   In short i am really enjoying this game and would recommend it to anyone wanting a good turnbased strategy game."
"I'm still just getting started with the game and I will say, it's very good and definitely worth even the full price (although I did buy it on sale for fairly cheap.) The story is nice although I will say it is REALLY anime. That might be a good thing for you, might be a bad thing for you, but odds are if you are even considering this game and you see how it looks, you probably are ok with that. My only other complaint is sometimes the models glitch out, like weird bendy arms or bags floating over their heads, but those are the only glitches I've encountered.  The gameplay is sorta like X-Com only you control the aiming and actually are running around, and every troop (both friendly and enemies) are in overwatch the entire time.   Another nice thing is that every friendly soldier is a person. Aside from the intro, from what I can tell all units you have in your squad are their own person with their own personality.   Oh, and there's permadeath. That's always fun. However it's easy to avoid a character getting permadeath, since you simply have to send another troop over to them to call in a medic and get them outta there.   Overall I'm falling in love with this game, and can see myself putting in countless hours (depending on how long the story is.)"
Shot a tank with a rifle  Shoddy rifle/10
rekt entire armies using Edy and a Ruhm 10/10 would go rambo again
"A PC release of a 2008 critically acclaimed PS3 game.  TL;DR : Go for it, especially if it's on sale. It'll be worth your money if you like strategy games.  Done on i5 2500k, 760 GTX, Xbox360 controller.  The pros : - Awesome graphics style, does not feel 'outdated', not too heavy on the GPU (around 30-40% usage). - Good soundtrack. - Lasts around 25 hours, doing almost everything offered by the game. And there's a New Game+, if you want to. - The gameplay is quite original, mixing turn-based strategy and third person shooter. The levels have various gimmicks, encouraging you to think a bit. - Decent plot.  The cons : - Some long range shots can be annoying to line up with a controller. - Quite a few anime clichés, some of them being a bit too much for me (stop with the annoying mascot already, Japan!) "
"Pros: Unparalleled animation; superb voice acting; novel game design; engaging yet unobtrusive cut-scenes So-so: Humdrum level design; combat engine is serviceable but flawed Cons: Naive, emotionlly stunted characters, dilogue and storyline; typically sexist depiction of women Overall: 8/10  As you can see, on balance I really liked Valkyria Chronicles. It does lot of things really well, particularly the animation. It's got a unique visual style that really brings the characters to life, and the voice acting is as good as any I've heard in a video game. The combat engine is a little klunky (for example, a tactic you'll end up repeating ad nauseum is to run directly up to a bad guy who's got a bead on you and shoot him in the head), but if you're willing to suspend disbelief on that, the missions are still fun and challenging.  You might say that the game owes some of these qualities to its amine heritage. Unfortuntely it also inherits several defects from that same heritage. Most notable is how the characters are depicted: totally typical of Japanese animation, the world must once again be saved by teenagers with the emotional maturity and sophistication of Hello Kitty.  The females are, of course, unanimously proportioned like 70's-era Barbie dolls, and their military uniforms consist of miniskirts and thigh-high stockings. If you don't think this is offensive, take a moment and imagine how a real army veteran would react if you handed her a uniform like that and told her she'd have to wear it into combat. Yeah -- it's offensive, folks.  It boggles my mind that in this day and age, Japan is still cranking out anime of this nature. It's nothing new, of course, but it's practically universal -- look at virtually any anime cartoon or comic and you'll see the same thing. And let's just dispel any notion that simply adding sex and violence to a childish, immature story makes it an adult story. It just makes the sex and violence contextually inappropriate -- like adding a ♥♥♥♥ scene to a Peanuts cartoon. The story in Valkyria Chronicles is about a war, but don't let that fool you -- it still has the depth of a cardboard cutout, and the characters act and react the way a child would. This may seem approprite given that they actually *are* children for the most part, but that's a problem in itself. It's really quite puzzling why the game's creators would think it appropriate to populate the army of a nation at war with naive teenage girls. Perhaps they think this makes the game more relatable to its audience. I'm not even going to bother explaining all things catastrophically wrong with that reasoning.  I would love to see an anime-style game (or show) that features adult characters, or at least characters capable of expressing themselves in an adult manner. Until then we have to take the bad with the good. Make no mistake: the bad, in this case, is substantial -- but the good still outweighs it. Valkyria Chronicles is a fun game with some amazing visuals, Enjoy it -- just try not to cringe too much at the dialogue."
"I'm 4.5 hours in and this game is pretty amazing. Extremely fun, likeable characters, and great game mechanics. The way they give personality to each of of your team mates, even minor soldiers, in the story really aids in investment. Also, the way you progress, via the book is pretty inovative; It really makes it easy to only play for short spurts and come back to it quite easily later if you don't have much time without getting lost where you were in the plot. If it keeps on this way, I can see myself missing it and the charachters when I beat it. It's a steal at the current Steam sale price, one reason I bought it, I would have paid full price for this game if I knew what the gameplay was like before the sale. Well done SEGA!"
"if you love turn base stragety war games and anime, this is a great game that combines the two. on a second note, if you are like me and played the 8-bit game Shingen the Ruler on the old NES, you will like this game. then i would play for 8 hours and have mom yell at me, Valkyria Chronicles not will have me play 8 hours and have my wife yell at me. 9/10 great game."
"Very interesting of a game, story is detailed as if im watching anime *not a weeb or anything*, to me the gameplay is fun strategic. with the 16GB put into this game in my opinion it's worth it 9/10. people be saying that the controls are a bit wonky its either you use the keyboard or mouse *mouse is usually for picking a character/aiming other than that use keyboard imo*"
"A gripping, realistic portrayal of the unspeakable horrors visited upon the common people of Europe during World War II, and how people from all walks of life can triumph against any odds by setting aside their differences to work together for the greater good. But, instead of Nazis there are qt anime waifus."
Do you like military?  Do you like 2D anime characters?  Well then do I have the game for you.  It's basically a turn based 3rd person shooter version of fire emblem with an amazing story  10/10 would mortar infantry again
"Solid story, mixes rts with fps competantly,and upgrade mechanics."
Amazing gameplay and fun to play! Hilarious glitches during cutscenes where headbands and eyes go out of place.  Game is definitely worth the money and gives hours of entertainment
like fire emblem with guns and third person view.
"Great turn-based game, yet have a shooting-game like system.  And as you can see in the poster on this store page, you will probably send the baker girl into deadman's ground with Gunther giving all defensive orders... to capture the flag.  10/10 the poster never lied."
"For now, it seems that i was addicted by this game.. Challanging missions, and epic stories make me curious about what will happens in the end of the story.. Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics: 7/10 Overall: 8/10 VC_LANCER:"
It's like some chess etudes for gamers. (9.5/10)  Why won't they release the Grandia franchise? That was awsome too...
"One of the best games I've played in a while. With a fair amount of customization available (capability to swap weapons used by your soldiers for different battlefield purposes, same for your tank [though only one of them]), with a straightforward yet still welcome R&amp;D tree (you buy upgrades for your tanks and develop more capable small arms for your foot troops), and the capability of choosing new recruits, with each of them having their own traits (they act as buffs or debuffs when triggered in game). All in all, you can tailor your squad for each mission's requirement, being able to obtain the most from the positive traits and avoiding the negative ones as much as possible. Basically, you have plenty of freedom when it comes to building your combat force.  The story is pretty damn good, and the characters are well written. The game mainly relies in cutscenes for the story-telling, which while plenty and long (much like MGS), are entertaining and very well made (graphically gorgeous. Reminds me about Okami). Further information can be read in the game's glossary (for varied information), weaponry (for information regarding the weapons used), personeel tab (information about each individual which makes an appearance in the game, except a few generic ones), amongst others.  Combat is done within the player's turn. This obviously means that you can only move your troops or make actions if it is your turn. However, said actions are done in real time. And it's the player who has to manually aim the weapon, or perform the required repairs/healing (though some classes will automatically engage the enemy if close enough). In order to do these, the player has to spend 1 (2, if a tank) Command Point, and these are scarce, so it's better not to waste them. Amongst the mechanics, the game features the so called 'orders', which basically act as buffs or direct fire support against the enemy. They may be issued with Command Points, except if there's a special condition which doesn't allow you to. A problem I've noticed, however, is that tanks pathing is quite terrible.  In short, if you like strategy games rich in story and suited in a pseudo WWII scenario, then this game is for you. It plays quite a bit like MGS Peace Walker, actually; but trading the solo stealth approach of MGS with clashes of opposing armies in a turn based setting.  Overall, the only three cons I can find are:  1) Long and plenty of cutscenes (not a problem if you're an MGS fan. Even then, they're enjoyable, so that's not much of an issue).  2) Tank pathing (given that you can only move a limited distance every time you choose a character/tank, having your tank turn 90 degrees or get stuck into basically nothing can prove to be costly, especially with anti tank units around).  3) Some songs kinda get bland after a while."
Turn-based anime simulator.
I like the game! :D please release a direct sequel of it for pc!
"Valkyria Chronicles; a tactical-role-playing-real-time-third-person-shooter, combining all the fun of the second world war with every anime cliché you can think of.  Set in 1935 on the war torn continent of ‘Europa’ in a conflict very similar to WW2, VC has been on my to play list since its release and appealed greatly to my love of anime and role playing games. The developers clearly know its potential audience well and catered to it, however this ends up being the game’s downfall... You can read the rest of this review here  https://fivehundertwords.wordpress.com/2015/04/13/review-valkyria-chronicles/  "
One of the most best games I ever played!!!
"Good tactical gameplay with plenty of options to approach missions, cute personalization of the squad members makes you care about them. Loved the WWII-punk setting."
if you love the game watch the anime series!
Pros  - combat system - story - voice acting - music - art style  Cons  - clunky tank controls - too many cutscenes
" Valkyria Chronicles   is a turn-based tactical RPG set in a pseudo-European military conflict heavily representing World War II. Within its fictive story, the game touches on various real life issues and events of the wartime.   The story of Valkyria Chronicles follows Squad 7, a military squad of the small nation of Gallia (roughly representing France) in a military conflict against the East Europan Imperial Alliance (roughly representing Nazi Germany). As the story progresses, it touches on various serious topics such as racism, concentration camps, and nuclear weapons, to name a few. In most cases it does it really well too, and I say in most cases only because its depiction of concentration camps was fairly mild when compared what you can get by just picking up a history book. It really does depict horrors of war well. Maybe not quite as well as, say, Valiant Hearts, but definitely well enough.  That said, Valkyria Chronicles is very narrative-driven game and you spend roughly half the length of the game watching cutscenes and reading dialogue, so if that is not what you are looking for, you might want to look elsewhere.  The fact that characters are all likeable, well written, and actually believable contributes to the total enjoyement of the story. Two main characters, Alicia Melchiott and Welkin Gunther (who, pardon the stupid reference, is basically Yang Wenli), were both very memorable and likeable characters, and from the side characters, especially Faldio turned out to be a very interesting well written individual. I have no complaints about other members of Squad 7 either. What is the most impressive is that in addition to the central characters, the game has a very diverse cast of possible squad members, representing different social backgrounds, ages, races, genders, and sexualities. Each of them has their own personality, their own likes and dislikes, and a backstory about how they ended up taking part in the war, which really adds to the immersion of the game and its world. Hell, they even have allergies!  The gameplay of Valkyria Chronicles is somewhat similar to games like Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy Tactics or Code Name: S.T.E.A.M, with few unique twists. In place of the grid-based movement system those games have (Fire Emblem has one right?), you move your units freely in the environment in third person view, as long as your Action Points allow you to. Attacking is then done in semi-real time by shooting with your weapon. During your turn, enemies can shoot you with interception fire if you walk in their line of sight, and during your opponents turn, your units are doing the same. This places a heavy emphasis on unit positioning. What is the most important is that all this plays out really well. Combat is strategic, it requires thought, and it is sufficiently challenging. If you mess up really badly, you can even end up permanently losing your squad members, which really adds to the feeling of tension during combat.  Visually Valkyria Chronicles looks really good, in my opinion. While the texture quality is quite outdated, the game uses very stylized kind of anime art style, which is just done really well. Of course, if you absolutely dislike everything with that distinct anime art style, you might not like it. It's very subjective thing anyway, just look up few screenshots and decide yourself whether you like it or not.  Soundtrack of the game was also very enjoyable. It is composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, whom you might know from his work in Final Fantasy XII and bunch of Final Fantasy Tactics games, and at least I have enjoyed his work previously.  I don't know about the console version, but the PC version also comes with both Japanese and English audio, which is always nice. Now, I don't know how good the English voice acting is, but the Japanese voice acting was exceptional good in this one. The main villain of the game is voiced by Fukuyama Jun (aka the Lelouch guy), and what can I say? I don't see why anyone would ever want to pass on an opportunity to have the villain of the game you are playing voiced by ever-so-magnificent Fukuyama Jun.  There's no serious problems with the PC port either. It runs perfectly, I never saw it drop under 60fps even though my computer is fairly old, and the resolution goes up to 4K. And it scales up really well too. Graphic options are admittedly fairly lacking, but with such a stylized graphic style, that is hardly an issue. The game controls perfectly well with both controller and keyboard/mouse, and the keys are fully rebindable with both. What surprised me the most is that after playing around for awhile with both, I actually preferred to play with keyboard and mouse, which is really rare for a console port like this. Selecting your units and aiming for critical hits just becomes bit less of a hassle with mouse, and if you are under enemy fire, that split of a second might just become a life saver. Anyway, they both work really well, so just use the one you prefer. There's just one complaint I have. Menus are not mouse-controlled, so that is definitely less than ideal. PC version is also really good value, as it is only 19.99€ (or your regional equivalent) and comes with all the released DLC.  So, in  conclusion , I have absolutely no qualms about recommending Valkyria Chronicles. Story is interesting, gameplay is unique, and the PC port is well optimized. It really is a great game and well worth the money. IF I had to make one small criticism, it is that while the game is making an anti-war statement and touches on various serious topics, it does not do that quite as thoroughly as it could. But that is just fine. This is a video game. It does not need to get overly political. It aims to deliver an enjoyable gameplay experience with an interesting story, and that it very much delivers.  Now then, I can only hope that with the commercial success of Valkyria Chronicles, SEGA decides to do proper ports of the sequels for PC, although considering that they are PSP exclusives, I do not think that is very likely."
"As a fan of JRPG, it's kinda sad that I've missed out a lot on awesome Japanese games because they don't really care about PC gamers. Unique turn based strategy gameplay, awesome art style, amazing soundtrack and most importantly the option to choose the original Japanese audio with English subtitle!  This game reminded me of some good old Japanese games that I used to play when I was young on my PS1/ PS2"
"This game is about 80% cutscenes and menu screens, 19% gameplay, and 1% onomatopoeia, but it still possesses a reasonable amount of entertainment, even for those not into the anime style and cheesiness of the story.  Not terrible / 10"
"Bit of a quirky storyline (Japanese take on Nazis &amp; Jews presented in manga, bit hypocritical to some degree) backed by unique gameplay &amp; a different reward/levelling system. Was probably too drawn out but a good 6.5/10."
Very good game. Good pace of development and you think it is easy and then gradually builds up and you start to care who gets killed and do your best not to let any of your rookies die. Great game
"The story is pretty cheesy, filled with boring one dimensional characters, predictable plot twists, and needless sacrifices.  That being said, the art style of the game is very cool. It looks like everything is drawn on paper like a comic book. Your tank displays the word RUMBLE behind it as it moves. It's something I've not seen before playing this game.  The combat is what makes the game very good. There are lots of tactics to think about instead of just running in guns blazing. The mix of FPS and RTS is very refreshing. You have to keep things in mind like cover, assistance fire, and retaliation. The vehicular combat is also pretty fun with a wide variety of tactical benefits provided like smoke shells. Each mission has some kind of quirk to make it unique. This can be a bit of a 'trial and error' challenge. Often the first time through a battle you'll learn that your initial placement of troops was terrible and lose and the second playthrough will be a breeze.  The RPG elements of the game are quite dull. You spend XP to level up each class of character instead of characters earning their own XP. Upgrades to weapons and tanks just come automatically as the game progresses (actually you buy them but you have plenty of money so you can get everything). There's no way to speed up the development of the weapons, you just have to progress through the story. Honestly, they could have just removed the XP/Money system altogether and the game wouldn't have felt like it was missing anything.  My only other gripe is the speed of the game. Unnecessary animations in battle can eat up a lot of time (incoming mortar... on the other side of the map where nobody is... can we just skip seeing that?) The cutscenes are well voice acted but also tend to keep the pace of the game slow.  All in all, the cool art and combat style make this game worth playing. If you're looking for a good story or an in depth RPG system, don't bother."
"Good story, good combat, good art style, nice music, love the WWII aesthetic, and a long campaign."
I really enjoy turn based strategy\rpg games. This is one of my favorites of the combined genre so far.
"I confess that my interest for this game came entirely from the game Project X-Zone, which showed characters from the first game. I purchased this game and I honestly can't be happier, not only does it bring back several aspects of excellent tactical RPG goodness, but it adds in a few new ideas that make it a fresh experience and draws me in with a very rewarding storyline. The Skies of Arcadia camios are so good that I use Vyse and Aika every single mission!  What I love the most is the challenge. This game will tear you a brand, spanking new one if you aren't prepared or make a huge error. The zone of error is roughly 8/final fantasy tactics, if someone dies you have three rounds to get to them, where they will be evacuated by a medic. If you don't get to them in time, they are dead for good.   Think that Lancer doesn't have the accuracy to hit your tank in it's weak spot? Ha! think again!  Most entertaining is the level of depth the game goes into each individual class, they work VERY hard to make sure everything not just levels up, but has a huge bonus when they become elite.  The only issues I have are the cumbersome menu system (not really an issue), and the lack of an autosave (My own personal bias because I am an entitled modern gamer). The old reminder from the 90's is SAVE OFTEN.    This game is a 'MUST BUY' In my book. Grab it ASAP."
"This game is amazing, and this port is a very good port. I fully feel like this game is very underrated, and doesn't get the attention it deserves.  Pros: Fun and fluid strategy combat Great story (10/10, would cry again) Loveable characters All of the DLC is included 'upgraded' for the pc (it can actually do 60 fps!) Amazing art style, and does not look exactly outdated (was released in 08/09 on the PS3) The game isn't a cakewalk. RNG goodness  Cons: Menu system can be a nuisance Can't fast track or skip enemy actions The occasional 'unbearable' difficulty spike (I'm looking at you, Ch. 7) The keyboard setup isn't great, so controller preferred.  Now, off to 100% this great game"
"In a fictional World War 2, Fictional Swiss was invaded by fictional German Empire because they want some damn stones! The Fictional Swiss also a neutral country, they conscript civilians into militia army. In my squad, there is a 15 y/o sniper, 19 y/o scout, and 12 y/o heavy infantry. TWELVE! She hasn't reach puberty and already has kill count and a heavy infantry!  If I could rename my squad names, I'll name her Arya Stark.  Also, my tank driver is a cute anime gypsy girl. That is all."
"This game is a must try for someone yearning for something fresh and new. It's a turn based game similar to many RTS games, but instead of controlling dozens of units consisting of many soliders, here you control each solider individually and engage in real time combat. That said, it gives you limitations like the amount of movement each type of unit can use to only executing one attack before using up your move, similar to a turn based RPG. A game similar to this is Xcom. Beyond the combat, the game has a great story and is presented well. It's presented in cel shaded graphics, but it's done so well that it looks like an anime at times to even a moving painting during certain cutscenes. What is amazing is how fluid everyhting is from the movement during the gameplay to the cutscenes. Finally the story is really well done with amazing character development among the major characters, and the lore about the world and the war going on is very intriguing as well. If you are a WW2 buff, especially in films, then you'll also see some similar themes and elements from movies like Saving Private Ryan to Band of Brothers. Overall this is a must-have game for most gamers, especially if you enjoy a good story or turn based RPGs.   That said, there are a few flaws I should mention here. The biggest flaw is how it takes a lot of hits at times to kill certain enemies who are 'in cover'; however, you can clearly see their whole body since you are flanking them, but if they are crouching near some sandbags, then you are screwed. Then some operations are ridicolously hard. The game overall is challenging, and it can be very unforgiving with some of your mistakes at times. That said, some operations will have you go against unlimited reinforcements until you take out both enemy tanks who are way overpowered, then other operations the boss has what feels like can duck and dodge everything, even when you sneak up on them and they don't see you. That said, with the overpowered tactics the enemies have, then there are cheap ways to win. A quick example, but with the right orders and personel, then you can take the main base to win a couple of moves without killing many enemies at all. In reality it's ludicrious thinking a scout can win the battle alone against tanks, shocktroopers, etc. Then during some missions in which the enemy has a major advantage, then again there are ways you can cheaply win with the right orders and positioning your players before they appear. It's cheap, and it's a flaw that wouldn't be necessary if it wasn't for the over excessive advantages the enemies have at times, but it doesn't take away the fact this game is very good and is a must have. Easily a 9/10."
War has never been this kawaii.

"Some very preety anime style characters, with an awesome art-style, the story may be a little cliche but its still engaging. The turn based combat, while seemingly simple, it's awesomely implemented and has lots of complexity layers, making the battles continuing to be engaging even if the battles would normaly feel somewhat repetitive.  Awesome game, bust buy on sale."
"It felt frustrating at first because it takes a while to get used to, but after getting used to it, it became one of richest game experiences I've had in a while."
"First off, despite it's superficial resemblance, this is not a JRPG. Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest are JRPGs. This is a turn-based strategy game.  It just happens to be a GREAT turn-based strategy game.  Great story. Memorable characters. Unique and memorable game systems. Difficult, sometimes to the point of frustration, but you can save during combat so be sure to use this feature wisely.  Highly recommended. Best experienced on a big screen with a gamepad, as it's a port of a PS3 game."
"Good gameplay, well-scripted, real stakes. Worth playing at full price, a steal on sale."
Fun and neat-looking tactical RPG with some cool characters.
"What if Xcom was an anime? and what if that anime was set in alternate history World War II? What if every unit in the game was always on overwatch? Most importantly, what would you get if you had pixar tier voice acting added on top of all that?  You'd have Valkyria Chronicles, a freaking amazing game.  What are you waiting for? buy the thing already!"
"valkyria chronicles is a game that must have to somebody love srpg, people who like front mission, xcom, the story and character development is fantastict. the upgradeable weapon, tank, and character leveling up is deep enough, it doesn't make you confusing but very friendly UI menu when you wnat to leveling up/upgrade character, the skirmish mission is not mandatory, like you always take skirmish mission before the main mission, no..is not. the one that make me frustated is the unskipable of enemy or your ally movement or at least make some option to fast forward , make me wait anothe minute and minute...damn! so annoying. and if this game have heart to heart between the squad it will be great addition, make you more care with your squad, make more responsible, like fire emblem well overall this is good game i gave it 8/10, if the battle skippable or have option for fast forward, i'll give this game 10, seriously......not joking here"
"Great game, but you need a psp to play the other 2."
"Love this game so much. Nothing like it. Xcom with more control over units. Buy it now and love Alicia and Selvaria. You can go play outside, or you can play at your computer and do something that matters!"
"Would cry again playing this.  Also, controlling the tanks...freaking tanks."
 Thoughts on Valkyria Chronicles
"Awesome title. For people who love turn-based strategy games along with a great pinch of RPG. All the episodes &amp; cutscenes will make you think you're enjoying a great story. The graphical engine is quite great and original, the gameplay is great, the challenges are well balanced, and the story is awesome (but I advise you, do not rush the game, you'd become bored. 1 or 2 chapters per day are a reall great pace).  "
"Good PC port, playable with Keyboard and Mouse, and overall very fun."
Good stratgy game. Nice graphics. Good story.
"Valkyria Chronicles is an old game 2009 i think. Dont let that sway you from getting this game because it is the best game in my steam library right now. I absoslutely love this game from the gameplay to the story. The story sucks you in and you will really feel for the characters. My favorite character is Welkin with his badass tank, lol its not because of the tank its becuase of his background as a nature lover, this game is very smart and has many meaniful moments in it. I heard there is a sequel but it is not on computer yet......Overall i give this game 10/10 Very fun to play i always come back to it day after day. BUY IT."
"So, uh, this game is cool and stuff. It's like WWII except not and Galia is like a non-neutral Switzerland. They got like cool old school guns and grenades. Oh and there are like magical laser beam lances. I don't remember that being in WWII but hey, I'm not a historian. It's got a good strategy aspect to it as you send out your 15 ye- erm, I mean 20 something year olds out into battle using cover as they politely take turns shooting at eachother. There are t different classes you can choose from. Scout, Shock Trooper, Lancer, Engineer and Sniper. Snipers are my personal favorite because their military training allows them to hit the enemy a whoping 30% of the time. The story is quite beautiful too. Not only do you spend more time watching cutscenes than playing, you also meet many memorable characters such as Hans the flying hunk of bacon. Finally the icing on the cake is the graphics. Seriously. It's made all of water color. It's damn beatiful. Overall quite enjoyable and very much a game iI would recommend to all."
"Extremely addictive storyline, excellect game!"
I've just finished this game and I have to say this. You won't regret buying this!
"The gameplay is fresh, rewarding and fun but the story isn't that good in my opinion. It grows on you a bit but most of the characters are kind of annoying in the beginning."
"With a little help of Save &amp; Load technique, Alicia managed to finish her first scout challenge just with D rank. However, after she equiped the rifle she seized from the enemy, nothing can stop her from getting A rank. A true Valkyria just born in battlefield!!! ( I passed that challenge around chapter 6, then the scout challenge became extremely easy. Thus my scout team literally smashed the battlefield in later game. Can you even imagine a baking girl with a rifle could beat up 1 heavy tank just in one turn?)   Amazing.  10/10"
"Great story, great strategy and challenging gameplay - a must have title!   This game has so many qualities to offer I would've buy it a lot sooner if I knew it, even at full price."
"So, I was browsing for a jrpg for a 13 y o who's gaming, but haven't really found their niche yet, so we're trying out different stuff. Then I stumble on Valkyria Chronicles so I start to read up on it and find out that it contains tactical movement elements. This piqued my interest since that's something I like, and now I'm here.  I'd like to point out that, unlike what the tags for this game claim, this is not a strategic game more than you get the option to manage what soldiers are in your ranks and to some extent how they're outfitted. This game is about tactical combat. Also it's not an rpg, since you in no way 'play the story'. The story is scripted and the game play, again, is the tactical combat. So it's a visual novel with tactical combat.  Let's divide the good and the bad, starting with the good.  The story is interesting and takes place in a fictious version of ww2 Europe. This coming from someone who's not that into ww2, and find it somewhat overused as a theme in games, tv-shows, movies and so on. So here's a refreshing take that lends heavily from European history and culture.  The voice acting is really good which is a feat considering the large number of different characters in the game.  There is plenty of background material that is unlocked over the course of the game if one's interested in getting into the lore even more.  The tactical element is well thought through, and you have to manage what troops you bring into what battle, and not only make sure they work well together, but also try to manage it so that their drawbacks don't come into play too much.  Graphically the game is designed to look like a cartoon, painted in 2d. While the tactical movement is done in third person and you move around the map in 3d this does still work out well.  And now the bad:  There are some issues with controlling tanks during movement. Tanks have a tendency to move a bit as they want depending on which way the camera is facing. It seems that the problem is that movement is that controlling the tank is connected to the camera angle. This can be very annoying at times, but can be worked around, although you shouldn't have to.  Character movement includes a stopping animation that has to finish playing before you can move again. This can be dangerous if you accidentally stop in the line of fire of an enemy. Also if you don't exit a character immediately after having finished your actions with it any enemies that have clear line of fire to it will continue to fire until you do, which might net you a dead character if you're indesicive.  The terrain sometimes look like it would be traversable but isn't. This can leave your characters in bad spots simply due to there being no way of telling if you're going to be able to take cover behind a tree for example. Also according to the lore tanks were created to allow for trenches to be traversed. This is not the case in the game. You have to drive around.  The maps are very lacking and only rudimentary. They don't detail important terrain features enough, something that is vital in tactical combat.  There are some graphical bugs in the game that annoys me a lot, like someone's arm stretched out in an overhead arc and then attached to their hand.  I don't know if these are things the developers are working to fix, but as of writing this they have yet to do so.  Also there is little to teach you how to play the game. Gameplay tips keep showing up through the course of the game, but it would be nice to have a basic tutorial before starting the actual story.  In summary, my grade for this game lands somewhere between 6 and 7 on a scale of 1 to 10. If they fix the maps, the annoying graphical glitches, the controls and the terrain that's messing with movement I'd easily raise that grade to an 8, maybe even more.  All in all: - Nice setting even if you're fed up with or not interested in ww2. - Not an rpg. It's a tactical combat game. - Does have some bugs, but I haven't discovered anything completely game breaking yet. - Interesting story. - Good voice acting."
"enjoying the game immensely. took a bit of time to learn the controls, but the game is turn based, so you have some small amount of time to fumble finger with mouse and keyboard. game play is excellent with a few grimaces here and there when, if you've paused for thought after a move, the computer opponent continues to get in some extra shots and offs your character / squard member. the overall design is a great blend of squad level combat, character development, and tactical level command. throw in a neat steampunk / pre world war II story and you've got a game that i'll be playing for some time to come."
Faldio did nothing wrong
Some old fashion Japanese SRPG.
"Well that was an incredibly enjoyable and satisfying game. I can see how it's probably not going to be everyone's cup of tea, but it definitely was mine. Set in a fictional WWII era quasi Europe, it uses a pleasant blend of top down turn based strategy and 3rd person shooter on a skirmish scale. These things, combined with an engaging story, made for a game perfectly suited for someone with my taste in games. That being said, I can see how many people wouldn't enjoy this game for the very same reasons that I did enjoy it. It is heavily story driven, and people who skip cut-scenes and exposition will likely be driven out of their minds by this game. Likewise, while I found the blend of turn-based-strategy and 3rd person shooter engaging and tactical, I can see how people could find it frustrating. But for people who like strategy, story, WWII, and more story, this game is for you.   10/10"
"*Lines up Oscar to take a shot* *Oscar screams: 'STUPID IMPERIALS'* *Oscar headshots, killing the Imperial*  10/10, would rage at imperials again."
Beautiful and complex! Enjoy the challenge!
"I love how story focused this game is. The game play is enjoyable at first, but later on became more dependent on trial and error -- maybe I'm just not very good, but I had to restart many times on several maps just to get through it. Overall a very good game!"
"Control scheme is kind of wonky, and the UI is not PC intiutive. The story is VERY anime. Eye rolling every minute cheese. Personally would only play if you really like the combat, and can get over the anime tropes."
"…For a game titled “Valkyria Chronicles,” this game really isn’t about the Valkyria…  Anyway, I heard about this game while looking for more SRPGs to play – SRPGs being my favorite genre of video game. I enjoyed the game a lot. The story, while somewhat predictable at times, was well written and the character development was well done. Despite being a game set in a war, it has a relatively realistic take on war (i.e. it is hell). The game looks and plays well with one major exception that I’ll get into later on.  Tactically, the game suffers from its preoccupation with speed. See, like many other games in this genre and others, Valkyria Chronicles grades you after each mission. But instead of grading you in multiple areas, such as number of enemies killed or number of allies kept alive, the games only grades you on how fast you beat the mission. This means that to get the best rank, you need to make stupid choices like running through enemy fire just to get to your objective more quickly.  This wouldn’t be such a big problem if grades were cosmetic, like they are in most games that grade you. Here, the amount of experience you gain is mostly based on your rank. Later, you begin to receive the best weapons in the game only if you do well in missions. So…you either need to grind skirmishes to make up for lost experience or speed through the missions as much as possible...which I think is unfortunate design.  I have a few words on the battle system – you begin in Command Mode, where you get an overhead view of the map, and once you select a unit it zooms into Action Mode, where you control the unit in a real-time third-person shooter system. It’s unique and gives the game a bit of urgency – enemies will shoot at you as you approach in real time – but I feel they could’ve executed the system better. See, once you select a unit, each time the unit moves it uses up Action Points or AP. Once you run out of AP, the unit cannot move anymore. The problem is that if you misstep, that uses up AP.  Usually that isn’t a huge problem…except for the almost game-breaking issue I alluded to earlier, and that is driving a tank. The tank controls are atrocious. The game sometimes turns your tank in the opposite direction you’re trying to move in for some reason and that takes up AP. I’ve experienced blowing through a full bar of AP on my tank without it moving an inch. And some maps really necessitate you moving your tank quite a bit.  I still recommend the game heartily. You’ll have a good time outside of driving your tank."
Increadibly good game. Fantastic story and art style with top notch original mechanics. A+
"Having originally played this on PS3, most of the keybindings are oddly chosen but not badly enough for me to look into whether they're rebindable. The tank controls are completely ♥♥♥♥ed, though. That being said, I prefer Mouse+Keyboard solely by virtue of aiming with the mouse. Plus the graphics are pretty good and there's an option to use the Japanese voiceovers, so there's nothing I'd really complain about with this port.  The gameplay is really unique and the story is well-integrated into the gameplay through a chapter select designed to look like a book with the cutscenes and battles represented as images inlaid in the text. The story follows some kids drafted into the militia during a WW2-esque setting complete with anime concentration camps, a literal holocaust, and an atom bomb who just wants senpai to notice her.  This game was worth it at $60 when I first bought it, and I'd say this version is even better."
"Mostly my commentary: The port works fine. I was given the suggestion to keep the fps at default.  Only in the map with three railroad signs is there some sort of problem so far (don't walk up the two ladders nearest to the gatling bunkers but walking down is no problem). Both voices are kept and the English version is actually a lot more embellished than the Japanese in both translation and voiceovers (Cherry's final scout skill comes to mind). Having all the DLC straight from the beginning lets you do some interesting shortcuts. And just like before, if you have bad luck, this game can be very very frustrating."
"This Game is awesome, it has a weird Controll scheme if you played it on PS3 before. Its a Strategy 3rd Person Shooter with more emphasis on the strategy part if you want to know more watch a youtube Lets play because its very hard to explain how the Game actually plays"
The game name is Valkyria Chronicles  that why Almost of my squad is GIRL!! no need to care about potential :v
"I loved it for the PS3 and now for Steam. These turn base games like Final Fantasy Tactics is what I crave for. I like how as you're moving the enemy is firing back at you. So it's not turn by turn but more constant gameplay. Playing this game with tank, mortars, snipers. This game has it all. My only downside, for me personally, is that it doesn't have the Japanese audio like in the PS3 version."
"Like Fire Emblem, but better gameplay. Sort of a cross between FPSes and strategic turn-based ♥♥♥♥. It's a hell of a lot of fun, but you'll hate a few of the game's mechanics. Well worth the money (though I bought it on the Summer Sale, myself) and it makes me wish that the sequels were on Steam. So good!"
"So after making your own harem/squad of 15-year olds with rifles, bazookas and a walking nuke, I somehow turned the 12-year old girl into the most lethal of my executioners, who has no problem walking calmly into incoming fire and then proceeding to magdump any enemy in range.  Do I recommend this game? What a dumb question."
"This is a fun little game. At current prices, it's certainly worth adding to your library if you like this kind of thing.  The gameplay isn't anything groundbreaking, but it's decent, and there are enough options to give you a variety of fun tactical options on the battlefieldn.  Really more than anything, though, this game is about the art style and aesthetic. It's just pretty to look at. I had never used the word 'charming' to describe a video game before until I tried this. There are a lot of cut scenes and voice over dialog that add to the character. Set the language to Japanese and turn on the subtitles and bam, you are watching anime.  My only complaints about this game are that it gets off to a really slow start before you actually get to play a real battle. That was frustrating. Also, after a while, the gameplay becomes a bit shallow, and you may find yourself playing through the battles simply to advance the story.  7.5/10"
"This game already sucked me in after playing it for a few hours.   The art style in this game is gorgeous. For a game that came out orginally in 2008, these anime-style graphics feel like they haven't aged a day. I could go on and on all day raving to you about them, but that wouldn't be nearly as interesting as sitting down and seeing it for yourself. The story is rich and exciting, the characters are amazing too, each one fleshed out and intresting.   Also, WelkinxAlicia = the new otp.   "
Very good port of a PS3 classic game
"Pro's I've never been much for a Turn based shooter (Excluding Total war, not really a shooter but i digress). Simply put, this game is awesome! If you like WW1 era with a hint of WW2 mixed along with some nice story, emotional setbacks and some parts just eye swelling sadness, some action and of course anime with cute voice acting, this is the game for you.  Con's Very sad at some points and uplifting at other, bit akwards gameplay and repetetive combat(but what game now adays isen't repetetive) Turn based (Duh!) Very difficult if you don't posses a strategic mind(can always look on tutorials, If you need em *snickers at my name*) kinda akwards research system, (took me 6 hours of gameplay before i realised i could scroll down *facepalm*)   Tl:DR Good game, you buy, very satisfried"
The gameplay is simpel. Sometimes just rushing to objective will do. But the story is good. It's like reading a good book. I belive that is what the devolepers have gone for. :)
I really liked this game on the PS3 and it is good to see it again on the PC. I am playing it again and it is still a good game
"A very underated game!  Couldn't believe that this game doesn't really get more credits that it deserves!  The story is indeed from Japanese RPG (along with all its cliche) but the experience that this game provide is sure unique and quite new (IMHO)  But again, the game is sure challenging as the time goes..."
"I clocked the PS3 version around 50 hours, but still haven't finish it because this game could be VERY long, just like other JRPG. Ironically i finished the second episode with 80 hours of game play on the dead PSP, a more light hearted version of this game.  graphic: 7/10  does the job, does not age with time; very anime, i love anime so no problem from me.  game mechanics: 7/10 i love turn based strategy, just hope they have have an option to turn off the enemy phase animation just like the sequel. i absolutely hate the 'precision' targeting mission where you have to destroy a certain part of enemy super tanks under constant overpowered bombardment. yes, it's japanese XCOM, your teammates might permadeath. every teammate have their own background stories, while not as rich as the sequel, still seeing them die in combat hurts a lot!! the order might be OP, but provides interesting speed runs.  story: 9/10 if you want the concise version of the plot, do watch the anime series, while you can sense the twist and turns miles ahead, but still you'll cry when the moments come. the story background was post WW2 in an alternative world, a story of underdogs against mighty empire, racist, love, chosen one, and how over-the-top tactics trumped enemies time and time again, with extreme luck too.   music: 9/10 japanese composer never disappoints. that's why you still listen to castlevania, mario, one winged angel, SOC...... the soundtrack was great. very touching, yet fits the games perfectly. but i would say the sequel's are better, just my two cents. as a part time composer that arrange video game music for my students, i wish my students can play their songs.   PC port: 7/10 (generous) if TOTALBISCUIT didnt upheld his boycott against sega, i would say this game would sell a lot more on PC. yes, it's not a perfect port because it does not have FOV slider, no FXAA, barebones option menus, no proper mouse support......if you know what i mean, hahaha! as a gamer that do not have money for next-gen consoles, i would have to accept this moderate pc port. yes, you'll need a controller to smooth out the character movements, you still can aim perfectly using mouse though.  final remark: 8/10 a must buy for jrpg fans, i know, it's not for everyone. just doing my best to promote this beautifully flawed masterpiece of last gen!"
"I am going to be really blunt, I only played this game for a short time, so this will be a first impression.  And to be honest, I don't understand all the praise. I will admit, I think the art is stunning, it's not only beautiful but it also matches the setting perfectly, nothing to complain there. I also think the combat is original and refreshing, nothing too special. But in a story driven game, that wouldn't be a problem if the story and the characters could carry the game. I admit I haven't played the game nearly enough to judge the story, but the characters I met uptill this point are, in one word, boring. They are either the cliche nice anime boy or girl, or have just no personallity at all. And having to sit through these bland and boring characters talk to each other was one of the most uninterresting game experiences I have had in a long time. I usually like long cutscenes with a lot of dialogue, but it doesn't work if you aren't invested in interresting characters. I shouldn't be fighting the urge to skip all the dialogue, and non gameplay sections after only 40 minutes into the game. I also want to point out something that affects a lot of parts of the game, is that it takes it's time 'too' much. Every second I was getting the feeling that the game was showing of how beautiful it was, for instance when you kill an enemy with a main character, you get to see their face going 'yeah I did it', or when you select your unit for an action how it zooms into the map to the unit. It might sound stupid to complain about these small things since they only take a couple of seconds, but if every other thing that happens in the game takes 2 seconds too long, it starts to get annoying fast.  One last thing, one of my town watchmen got killed, facing 4 or 5 enemy soldiers. And the game told me that he had retreated... really? I don't think the demographic this game was made for has to be saved from even the notion of dying."
Have seen cute kudere sniper girl and now can't stop thinking about her. 10/10
"I love the animation, the story, and am a huge fan of the turn based combat and squad development system. I have found the past 114.5 hours of game time to be purley enjoyable and throughly entertaining. All for about the price of going to a movie, It really is worth the price of admission. I hope they continue to develop the game for the PC, as they have made a fan out of me."
"Great port, support for 4k, no loading times that were irritating on consoles, fps can be unlocked, great game and story. A must for jrpg fans. Hope they bring the other titles of the franchise."
Kakashi voice actor? 10/10 will play again :v
Great game had it for the PS3 glad i bought the port. The mechanics are great and the story is amazing. The AI can be challenging with only a few minor hiccups in their programming. The Gameplay is ver dynamic and strategic because not only do you have to move your units in position to get a shot at your enemies but you must do so while taking minimal return fire while you're moving while trying to set up choke points so you can get your units to take out the enemy while they move. My only complaint IS THE BROKE ♥♥♥ TANK BATTLE IN THE DESERT!
This is like watching a drama with bits of turn-based FPS ARPG strategy. Totally worth a playthrough.  Very loveable characters.  The game is also buggy as hell. So many shots were missed because glitches or invisible walls. You can also lose your main save file pretty easily in various ways.
Really good game if your into turnbased war games
May be slow in actual gameplay due to the port but otherwise great game
"This is a very fresh and attractive take on the tactical RPGs genre, with cell shaded anime like art style and psuedo-fps line of sight targeting. I really enjoyed the diversity in units, personality traits and even the training/buyiung components in the game. The game itself keeps the missions fresh enough for you to enjoy the various different objectives and there's even a small element of permadeath (if your downed troops are picked up by enemy forces) if you want protect your favorite roster members.  If I had a few gripes with the story it would be the generic love/lite-romance element they injected into the game and the generic gundam-like element of the valkyria once they get introduced which I feel takes away from the war-story. The lancers are quite a bit weak even in their primary purpose of taking out enemy tanks - in many cases you're forced to aim for their radiator weak point which puts them vastly out of position or even on equal footing as shock troopers who can at least intercept enemy troop movement.  Even with the learning curve and a few flaws along the way, I still can't help but recommend this title for most gamers out there who haven't tried it yet."
Wacky pragmatic grade system sucks a little fun out of this game.  Good Commander: Defeat all enemy units  Destroy all enemy assets No Allied casualties Objective met in a timely fashion = You get a D rank and low rewards.  Bad Commander: Enemy units still active Enemy assets still active No regard for squad safety Objective met in one turn  = You get A rank and high rewards.
10/10   Great game and great artistic style. Played through the entire game and it gives a challange for you strategy fans and has a great visual novel and anime elements in the story. The story is also amazing there were points when I may or may not have cried.  Overall would recomend great game at a great value.
"Anime children kill hitler. Classic. Notice me senpai indeed, Sniper Wolf."
"Awesome game , few games dare to try something new but this game done it and nailed it.  Its not perfect, but very enjoyable"
"Truly a fantastic game, hoping for the sequels to get ported as well."
Game made me a Jew sympathizer.
"A saga about the human experience in war. The tactical gameplay itself is engaging and enjoyable, but the story told by this game is what makes it stand out among other tactical games. Until the recent 'This War of Mine', Valkyria Chronicles stood alone in its ability to shine a spotlight on the emotion of war."
"My word, this is quite an enjoyable romp.  The only complaints I have (and these are minor!) are a bit of a learning curve, plus my tanks occasionally do a weird little jittery dance when moving. Something to do with the camera angles, I think. Other than that, I've been having a hoot with this.  Fair warning, though. If you pick up the Edy detachment dlc, you can pretty much turn your scouts into game breaking murder machines.  Who needs anti-tank specialists when you have SCOUTS with VERY LARGE GUNS? :3"
"Awesome Game. Great Graphics, Fun and Engaging Story. Ok Replay Value.  Wish I would have gotten it at the discount price however.....damn you STEAM!"
Good port of one of the best PS3 games I ever played.
"Nice RPG and you can play a panzer! 10 out of 10. Ok sometimes your crew is annoying but overal a really nice game, I like the action combat system and the fact that you can shoot things. Can be pretty hard if you have no clue what your doing )like me) but thats ok. I don t like too easy games. And well you can always google the solution XD"
One of my all time favorite games. Loved it.  My only complaint: The reviews on this game aren't 'Overwhelmingly Positive'. I cannot fathom why.
One of the best games I've ever played.
"Use to play this game a lot on my PS3, very nice story and you can feel what the war does to the characters and its worth it."
"Highly engrossing game, you'll lose track of time playing it until it's 3am.   It's a Stratagey RPG, which for those who don't know is a game that resembles a board game where you take turns on a level or game board. The graphics and interface gives the game a modern feel with third person aiming but make no mistake this is a game the requires paying attention to the map and placing units carefully otherwise your squad will have many casualties. The only levels that didn't work for me were boss encounters, the only way to beat them is trial and error, as you don't know if your bulliets won't scratch them.   The art direction is a real treat if you enjoy japanese animation, it's rendederd beautifully with cel-shading and expresive characters. The story, set in the ficticous contentent of Europa during the 'Second Europa War', is charming though a bit on the nose in it's themes.   The PC version works well and supports controlers and mouse/keyboard inputs you can use the mouse to align your shot without touching a menu."
"Like anime? Maybe JRPG's or Strategy RPG's? If so, definitely give this game a go; it's a very engaging squad based strategy RPG game with a decent story set in a sort of fantasy WWII setting, albeit with the supernatural power aspect of the valkyrias and ragnite technology in general. This game originally came out on PS3 and has been properly reworked for steam, although I do find myself preferring to plug in an xbox controller to play because of how the controls are set up, but mouse only users should still be able to adjust accordingly. Overall it's pretty good and fully voice acted (anime fans will be happy to know that this game does have dual audio, esp if you find the english voice acting too cheesy), with great tactical gameplay that can be very challenging but can usually be handled very cleverly in very few turns with the right tactics and often times, orders (which are pretty much buffs) used. My only complaint would probably be how cringeworthy the main character, Welkin Gunther can be, with his over the top gentleness and obsession with biology (not even kidding) in the middle of a friggin' war hahaha."
"This is an incredibly unique gameplay experience that you don't want to miss out on. There are few, if any, other places where you can find an even remotely similar mix of SRPG and 3PS, and Valkyria Chronicles pulls it off incredibly well. The classes are well-balanced enough to promote diversity in squad choices, the missions are diverse enough to not feel repetitive, and there's a great balance of the number of recruits available vs the character depth of each one (just enough that they feel non-generic and worth recognizing individually).  That being said, there are a couple issues to watch out for: there are situations that can feel unfair and a considerable amount of trial-and-error is to be expected in certain chapters. In addition, while the story is fun and entertaining, the anime cliche's are all here, so keep that in mind if they grind your gears."
"A very well-planned and engrosing game. The interface is not entirely intuitive, but works well and has few real flaws. The characters are what I would expect of an anime/manga, of which there are. The only frustrations I could find were the menu system asking you to verify every choice and the scoring system being based on speed vs actual tactics."
"Managed to win several levels in a single round using one scout.  Although good story, neat graphics and surprisingly addictive for tactical J-RPG.  10/10 for the amount of headshots in this game."
"I really like the art. The gameplay is nice, but I wish the condition for A Rank is not solely based on speed. They need to patch the Intel graphic card glitch."
"Overall a great game! Very fun, unique integration of strategy similar to tiles but with free movement. If you are a fan of Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, or other similar strategy games, you will like this!"
Nostalgia TRIP AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Great Port!!!
"Really enjoyed this game. Loved the art style, and the story telling of it. The battle system was unique.   Only partial let down was that the leveling system favoured speed rather than taking out the most enemies."
"A great game from the PS3, Port is basic but ok. Play with a controller :)  (here's hoping Sega bring VC2 and VC3 to PC too, I never got to play those)"
great game
"This game is awesome.  The only thing that I don't like is that the combat is so slow... I literally take 3 hours to finish ONE attack. And if you lose, you will have to do those 3 hours again.  Most of my party died because of this, I didn't feel like replaying 3 hours to save them."
"+Great art style which has managed to age pretty well since release +Plentiful host of characters to make up your squad, each with their own personalities and perks +Love the maps and interactive environments +Enjoyed the music score +Permanent death is a real reason to keep your favourite character safe +Gained a real sense of achievement from beating each 15-40 minute long story mission  +Felt genuinely motivated to invest the time in upgrading weapons and units, and unlock skirmishes +Can get a lot of play time from this game (might take...20 hours at least to beat the campaign) +A decent amount of replayability in going through maps with an different aproach to get a better score +For the most part the AI seems competent, being crafty and putting up a decent fight  -Some will not enjoy the narrative approach of this story, being an occasionally clumsy war narritive in one scene to being cute and happy in the next -This isn't the best console to PC port, option to reconfigure controller layout simply disappears after initial setup  -The rather static camera in combat really removes some involvement in the action, a more dynamic camera which followed grenade throws and bullets would really add a lot to the battlefield play -Unit levelling feels very thin in comparrison to other games released since, including the second VC game released on PSP (would very much like to see a AC: Liberation-style HD remake release) -My last playthrough, I couldn't beat the game because the last boss is practically undefeatable without a specific character. Which is nonsense.    Despite my niggles, I would highly recommend this game, really hoping that they release either a new game or rerelease the sequels after the successful rerelease of this title on steam, as the PSP exclusive sequels as they were pretty decent."
"Just finished my first playthrough, thought I'd give my two cents.  So what can I say about Valkyria Chronicles... Great plot, although not JRPG-Best. It's very straightforward without much comedy or unique characters, but they are all written pretty good. The settings is awesome though, I love just reading about it on the glossary in the game.  Gameplay is excellent, but sloowwwwwwwww even by strategy games standards. And it can be so frustrating at times, like your RPG dudes missing their target from 5 meter distance, or like there's no button for restarting a mission while you're doing it, instead you have to wait for mission failure, or alternatively load a new save. And this game doesn't have autosave so you gotta remember to save frequently. Well not frequently, since the gameplay is so slow, but after and before every mission it would behoove to do so.   Anyway, music is nice, but aside from some tracks nothing really captured me. It's nice atmospheric music. One track that I can't stand anymore is the enemy faction music. It's always being played again and again, every freakin time they get their turn. So annoying...  Game was long, took me 50 hours to complete, so you'll definitely get your money's worth. There's even New Game + with all of your stuff coming back for a second playthrough, which is great. Love it when games do that.  Overall I'd heartily recommend it to any JRPG fan, as they'll be getting their money's worth. But be warned that you need a lot of patience for this game. It's also one of those games that's hard to learn but easy to master. Things get easier as you progress.  I still didn't play the DLCs btw... It's very long, really really long. I mean, the battles just drag... but it was worth it, because the gameplay is sooo satisfying. Anyway, I'm repeating myself.  I'd give it an 8/10"
"Very good SRPG, Nice Visual style"
"This title is different from your usual tactics games. Its very challenging and some levels require a good amount of thought and planning. I love the art style and the soundtrack is well done in my honest opinion. The game allows you to gain alot of knowledge about your characters even the non-hero units. Each person likes, or rather, compatible with another, some fancy the opposite gender/same gender, some are allergic to desert sand, and some just dont like to be around men/women. The game lets you focus on unit placement and cohesion which is very similar to what goes on in active duty in the military. Its really fun fighting in skirmishes and testing unit combinations and watching people grow and get stronger. There is a perma-death but only if you cannot reach them when their HP is down to zero or if the get 'captured' by the enemy. This title is fun and interesting and if you are a fan of tactical/strategy games, give this one a shot."
"The game was orginally from the PSP years back and I was sad that it wasn't available in consoles but all those sadness were blown away when I found out they made it to PC. Hopefully they also make the sequels come to PC too and if they do I'll be happy to spent my money and have a wonderful time playing it and progressing for the story.  Straight to the point:  -The Story is Wonderful and Depressing that shows how traggic war is and there are many more things you have to find out yourself. Drama hits hard on me in the game and the comedy made me laugh out loud (yes it's funny not joking). -Characters are likeable and the development is great, you'll eventually learn more about them; their past, favorite hobby and etc as you progress through the story. -There are different type of weapons that you can use for your different tactics whether it's defensive, Offensive of passively you role with. -Gameplay is impressive and unique for me, even if it's an old game still its really addicting. It's not require for people who are not a fan of turn based game. -I love the graphic, it matches the game really well and even if it's an old Game it doesn't really affect you when you progressly play the game. When the gameplay is good, then the graphic can be aside. -All and all the game for me was exciting and I give it a 10/10 along with the satisfied ending. It put a smile on my face.  For the long one:  The game is in 1935 C.E., the continent of Europa is dominated by two superpowers: The autocratic East Europan Imperial Alliance in the east and a commonwealth of loosely allied democracies known as the Atlantic Federation in the west. The economies of both powers depend on a precious multipurpose mineral called Ragnite. Its growing scarcity results in the Empire declaring war on the Federation, sparking the Second Europan War.The Empire uses its military superiority to quickly put the Federation on the defensive. Emboldened by their progress and momentum, the Empire decides to invade the neutral Principality of Gallia to seize its rich Ragnite deposits.  (Go check Wiki or somethin to know more)  The story was wonderful and depressing. We all know how war works all around the world, those who fight to protect or for hatred and ended Alive with a future or deceased without a future. While playing Valkyria Chronicles, you'll experience how traggic war can be (Well it is always), how power is the key to victory but yet some chose to fight naturally. People will do whatever it takes, even using ancient power for that sweet victory (It's the same as real life if one of the powerful leaders found something powerful to use it to rule the world) Then that's where Squad 7 comes in and prove that victory can be achieve naturally with tactics that can lead you to that victory.  In the game you'll be controlling the Squad 7 and in command of 8-10 Units on the battefield and their Lieutenant; Welkin Gunther who rides a badass tank in the game. Each skirmish works differently and it lefts you thinking on how to plan your tactics carefully without making mistakes and not end up with your units being killed by raining bullets or really annoying RNG hitting you everywhere or in other words, you luck is on your side or not. Though it doesn't hurt to learn from your mistakes and refresh your mind into a new tactic that can achieve your victory. I re-runed alot of missions due to some flaws and RNG but then eventually I did achieve that sweet Victory (pleasurable)  There are five classes that works differently with their own personal specialty. -Scout; scout the areas to locate your enemies and can go behind enemy lines. -Shocktrooper; storm enemies with their smg and gun them all down. (This class is my favorite amongs all) -Lancer; the tough guys with the big lance that can shread some armor. -Engineer; who repairs obstacles or vehicles and replenish ammo for your squad. -Sniper; headshot, headshot and more headshot.  Now moving on to the characters.  Personally I love the Characters, each one of them except Mexamilalin (I don't how to spell his name). Welkin Gunther is my most Favorite character in the game along side with Alicia, Rosie, Largo, Zaka and Isara (Most fav heroin). From the Start i didn't have any interested in the characters but eventually after knowing their, hobby, past and passion, I grew deeply in love with them.   Not saying only towards the Main Characters, even the secondary characters have their own personality that can effect in the battlefield and their very own description. There are some DLCs that involves some of the characters from the unit selection like Edy's Detachment (I like Edy too :3) Each character have their own personality and there are advantages and disavantages depending on the battlefield you are in. Some don't like to be lonely, some like to be alone, some like these terrain and etc.  PS. Salveria is Hot.  Weapons,  Upgrading your units and progressing through the story lets you unlock more upgrades that can increase the power,accuracy or adding effects to your weapons, same goes with increasing your units hitpoint, def and unlocking some orders and pottentials. There are 3 types for the Bolt Action rifle, SMG and Sniper; Power, Range or Adding effects, it all depends on how you plan your tactics. I always been so eager to unlock more upgrades so I can upgrade my units to become more powerful and have an easy win in battles. I got nothing else to say about weapons since that's all.  Graphic,  Graphic doesn't bother me,I love it actually; it matches the game and story. it's an old game back in 2008 so what you expect? I can be very picky sometimes to graphics but if the gameplay is netter then the Graphic of the game can be aside. However I love the designs of the characters, outfit and military plus the castles and stuff.  Not a good review but I have to say that I Love the game and it put a smile on my face at the end. So  10/10  "
"Beautiful graphics and cutscenes, wonderful story, in-depth strategic/tactical gameplay with RPG elements. I would recommend to anyone who likes strategical games, especially if you liked any game in the XCOM series!"
One of the best Turn based strategy games.
"The best game from Sega in years. Best sleeper franchise.  Play Valkyria Chronicles, buy it on PS3 to show even more support. Then proceed to cry over how tall of a mountain this sits upon over the dirt wasteland that is Valkyria Chronicles 2.  Then cry for Valkyria Chronicles 4 on PS4/PC."
Played one of the EX thing DLC just to see if I can run this game... New to this game and got gunned down the first 5 seconds... 11/10
"Bought while it was on sale, graphics looked good but wish I could've toned them down to make it run smoother for my computer. Just found this game to be boring and not fun. Just not for me."
This is a fantastic game with a great mixture of turn-based and real-time combat. This is a great PC port as well. Highly recommended.
Hazah!  A story in wihich the romance is not a love triangle!
Great Game. Great graphics. Only problem is not beeing able to skip all those cutscenes at the game start and such.. they really are nicely done and with an exquisite graphic style that is pleasant but.. they tend to get a bit boring after a while. Other than that.. great game.
"The game is very well made, with a very unique spin on the gerne. The story sadly falls apart very quick, Perhaps it's because I am not into anime, but it quickly started to bug me and i found myself skipping most of it.   The main reason I can not recommend this game to a fan of this gerne is the one very broken gameplay mechanic.   If the AI attacks you while your character is facing them, your character will barely shoot a few shots at him if any. If you attack the AI while he is facing you. The AI fires a whole volley of bullets at your before you even attack.   This makes the whole core gameplay of the game feel broken and unbalanced as you cannot rush an enemy head one, but he can with great ease."
within 5 minutes of playing you talk to fish get arrested then shot at. i like a game that keeps the action going lol
10/10 great game.
"I've put in ten hours so far in a day's worth. The colors and art style are amazing. The voice acting is great; the gameplay and interface are good, too, but it takes getting used to since it's a port. It really feels like a story... and you can customize your squad with a whole bunch of characters... and from there, each character has 'affinity' with other characters, which help activate their potentials.   That last part is like a shipper's dream when you decide who gets to go into battle and team within the squad. Jann with any one of his close friends is an interesting and fun choice. Oh, and Dallas. Sweet, sweet Dallas.   Regardless, I really like this game and will recommend it to anyone who is interested in tactical, RPG games in a historical setting. Give it a... shot, pun intended, and I'm sure that you won't regret it!"
You can turn this game into a ' Waifu Soldier Killing Simulator '   11 Waifu / 10 Waifu  Isara is my Waifu that's +1 point
"what a horrible port to pc 3/10. played it on ps3 and wow then its a most get. put unless you know how to fix the controls then well its not worth it. but if you can be ready for a awesome ww2 inspired rts/jrpg hybrid that will keep giving until the end, then the dlc missions are a nice step up in difficulty and back story in to sub npcs. everyone in your sqad and mini army list has lines to talk and can perma die so be careful...."
"A decent game, one that player can use tactic to win. However, it doesn't have a special feeling to it as you progress further into the game:  [ ]Playthrough: The game is very much like Fire Emblem, which players can rearrange battle position if they lose or feel restarting the 'current' battle. The only fun I had on the game was restarting battles to win or feel greater about my victory.  [ ]Power and control: There are no individual levelings, so you're favorite character is not special. There is also a grind mode, where you can play through repeatly to level everything up. Sounds fun? Well, not till you know it's long, is very repeative, and not very progressive into overpowering your troops, but you do need them if you want everyone to survive, (easier and less tactics in battles). [ ]Over use of game: I've only manage halfway through game, but I can say this isn't something I want to replay after seeing the end. Since there are no way to plow through the game and experiment, the first run is what counts.   Verdict: Purchase and play this game if you want/need the storyline. The price value is worth the experiment (wait for a good sale too)."
"As someone that's played the PS3 game recently, I'll just go over some of the improvements of the port and what I would have liked to see.  First the obvious. 1080p and 60fps. The game already looks visually impressive and is greatly helped by the greater resolution. I would have liked some Antialiasing in the config menu though. Just a teeny bit to smooth out some edges. The game runs well with pretty low requirements.  I don't see it mentioned too much but the other massive improvement is the load times. The ps3 version had some really long load times when going between menus like setting up your team or getting rewards. Load time in the pc port is so fast I hardly even notice it at all.  I would have liked better mouse support. Mouse support for the menus especially. Button bindings for the mouse aren't the best but I suppose middle mouse click(esc) to end turns is the best they could manage. Also, I would have liked more speed when using the mouse in command view. Mouse sensitivity doesn't seem to influence the mouse speed in this view. It's incredibly slow and just faster to use wasd to select the next unit."
"I loved this game on the PS3, Love it on PC, can't wait for the remasted on PS4"
"Pretty good game, be prepared for hours and hours of long battles if you are not prepared though. This is a strategy game more than a shooter."
"Havent got that far in the game yet, but im lovin it!! Brilliant story so far, gorgus animations and addictive gameplay..just how I like it. "
"Come on SEGA, Release more in PC, Valkyria seires, Yakuza series. Where are they~"
"Very interesting mechanics, and a good story. Highly recommended."
"Such a beautiful game, lovers of RPG's would enjoy!&lt;3 (:"
"Cosy gameplay, really enjoy this game."
"The Fire Emblem vibe is very strong in this one.  While the plot maybe somewhat cliche, the gameplay was pretty fun.  P.S. Isara best girl"
"The most underrated gem on the PS3, Valkyria Chronicles is an strategy RPG darling. The game is unique in visual style as well as its strategy gameplay. But I'm not one to give a game credit solely for being a special snowflake. The game also needs to have excellent design and story. Fortunately Valkyria has that in spades. There's a lot of nuance and depth to the strategy that is simple to pick up but you've never really mastered. Each of the dozens of different and engaging levels can be approached in an almost infinite number of ways. The game also masterfully uses permadeath, by making it so that while the characters are likable, the length and difficulty of the levels makes it so that many times weighing your success against the personal sacrifice of your troops is not an easy choice. But most of all is how wonderfully told the story elements around our main cast is told. No game has made me cry as consistently as this one. Spectacular twists, lovable characters the game has it all. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
"Okay, this is just freaking unique, artistic, intense, and enduring.. wrap all that up in total strategy and you have the description of this game. The artwork is just absolutely amazing. It's in a style I've used myself all my drawing life which is almsot 50 years of being an active artist. The combat mechanics are presented in a challenging but very informative way. The tutorials happen as you go as you need them when new situations present themselves. I just love everything about it... the story, the art and the combat. Well done!  ishKiia Animator, illustrator, and author ishKiia Studios"
"If we ignore the game breaking crash bug in Chapter 3 altogether, which alone is reason enough to never buy this piece of ♥♥♥♥. I mean SERIOUSLY. How do you get away with charging actual 'REAL' money for this. You've had more than a year to patch it.   BUT IGNORING THAT ALTOGETHER:  Weird white lines cover parts of the window when playing in windowed mode. The intro cutscene (and some others for no obvious reason) are unskippable, no matter how many times you see them. The camera will get stuck behind buildings, so you're totally blind when shooting. That's avoiding the several paragraphs I could write about the combat mechanics...  The audio doesn't sync up with the cutscenes, and sometimes even the gameplay, with gunshots being half a second late. The graphics are pretty, but prone to missing textures, and occasionally entire buildings will simply have no texture load, and be a big garish white 'block'.  The text is so small that playing in windowed mode without a magnifying glass is just impossible. The text will sometimes show up at the top or bottom of a speech bubble, cutting the letters in half and making it impossible to read. Sometimes, this means you have to reload a level, because you have no idea what you're supposed to do to progress.   Sometimes land mines explode, even after being disarmed. Sometimes Anti Personnel mines WILL damage your tank, and sometimes Anti Tank mines WILL damage soldiers. It's a roll of the dice, completely against what the game tells you.   The turn limit on some missions is just stupid. Sometimes i'll finish a mission with dozens of turns to spare, sometimes I will fail a mission over and over because the turn limit is tiny. On one mission in a city, I had to just load it over and over again and sprint through the level, because that was the only way to beat it quickly enough.   The amount of enemies means that sometimes, an enemy turn will take upwards of 4 minutes to complete. In a single 'battle', that can sometimes mean an entire hour or more is spent doing nothing but watching enemies run around, and 90% of the time, theyre nowhere near your units. Hours of the gameplay in this game is literally just starting at the screen unable to do a thing.  The game will sometimes just throw six enemies in, teleport them onto the battlefield after a cutscene or scripted event, so out of thin air your men are suddenly surrounded, cut down, executed, dead, and there was nothing you could have done to change that. The only way to know would be to have prior knowledge, so you have to reload missions over and over just to know whats going to happen, assuming you don't just look up a guide, without which this game is pretty much pointless.  The tank controls are so bad, I don't think they were tested.   IGNORE ALL OF THAT THOUGH~  Worst of all, this game makes reference to, and I am not joking here... the Jewish Holocaust of WW2. They use the ♥♥♥♥ing holocaust as an 'edgy' way to advance the plot.   You people should be ashamed of yourselves. Seriously. This might be the worst PC port I have ever played. If you worked on this game, you should go to your grave feeling like just the worst piece of ♥♥♥♥.  On a technical level alone, out of the 200 games I own on Steam, this is the ♥♥♥♥ing worst. I would go as far as to say this is probably the worst 'PC Port' on Steam. In terms of the plot, it's offensive and insulting to the millions of people who died.  I have never called a game 'unplayable' before, until now. This game is un-♥♥♥♥ing-playable."
"I first played through this game on PS3 and now went for a PC run of it. The game itself with its scenarios and maps is good, though it rewards saving and loading to make sure you get the right rolls on the dice.  A problem with having played it once on a different platform is that you have to load the scene and then skip it. In new game + you can go directly to battles. I think the game would have been better with that option from the start. People that don't want the story can skip it, leaving more people with a better experience."
10/10 Would Skirmish again
"A partially old and inovate gameplay, great stoty for the ones who loves this kind of games. Recomended."
"An all round good game. Interesting &amp; engaging story, fast paced action &amp; helpfull instruction along the way. Loving it"
"Its Fire Emblem in first person.  That's what this game is. Its fire Emblem but in first person. FE combined the two phases that this game stresses into one chess match. Here; you're given a set pool of moves, and your foe always has more. You can kill certain dudes to lessen the amount of turns they can make, but it never matters. This movepool can be used on any unit so as long as they're 1. alive, and 2. within range. Also; each person can move a set amount per move point. Each consecutive move you take them for; they get a bit less movement range, but they always have one attack.  Your foes could feasably take one powerful unit and just destroy you. That constant threat, can also be done for me. I can easily cheese whole forces if I have enough firepower. Take the tank; shove it into a key persons mouth; and just wait for the game over screen. The tanks shots are realistic; so its an AOE. Granted, its not that powerful of an AOE, but its enough; particularly knowing theres just nothing you can do about it unless you happen to have a tank. Its not balanced. You could've just copied FE and it would've been so much better.  I'm not a nintendrone. Nintendo games are by no means the pinicle, but when I talk about this game, I just say 'Its FE but with guns and a broken battle system.' Because you know. FE is the most well known in context, and also happens to actually be a fair comparison. It does a lot of things right.  The voice acting is great, just like FE, and I like how they remain pretty silent on the field unlike FE; only telling you what you need to know every three seconds. 'ENIME SPOTTEED ENIME SPOTTEED ENIME SPOTTEEEED'. Stand right in front of him like I did in MGS: PW and watch the man eat three of the five shots because all the guns are like creme cheese. But in MGS:PW it was a sniper rifle. And he would always die. And I'd never get noticed because its MGS:PW and it wasn't the PSP's best game.  MGS aside;  FE's shoes can be fitted by VC. They can put them on and walk with them. But the shoes are a bit loose on VC's feet. And VC might get a nasty blister.  7/10."
"Valkyria Chronicles is trully one of the best T-RPG available on PC. Despite a 'naive' outlook, it actually has a lot of depth. The scenario doesn't have many surprises (it has a few...) but holds itself together and doesn't pretend to be better than it actually is. The lore, however, is a hole other story: it really works well and bring up some interesting points about racisme, war and all their consequences. The game will make you cry at least once. It might be in a plot twist, it might be when one of your soldier dies (or child soldier, for that matter), it might even be when an ennemy soldier die, but it will happen.  Now about its gameplay... Exellent, but flawed would be te best way to describe it. The 'BLITZ' system works really well as you alternate between the 'tactical mode', where you plan your strategies, and the 'action mode', when you put them in motion. The game suffers from an awefull balance, though: some soldiers and weapons are clearly overpowered when compared to others, and you don't even need to farm to be far stronger than your ennemy. Speaking of the ennemy, the AI is the greatest flaw of the game: it is far too scripted and make a lot of dumb move for no particular reason. It will sometime prefer to waste its turns patroling areas it knows you couldn't possibly have reached. Sometime, however, it will unleash its wrath against you and you will lose. Periode. But those moments are scripted as well and you will be prepared for it in your next try. I probably make it look worst than it is, though: Again, it is flawed but exellent nonetheless.  Also, buy this game and live in fear of chapter seven. You have been warned."
One of the best game in PS3 and now on PC!!! 
"Solid story, battles were challenging and rewarding. World building is good, could have been better, characterization was hit or miss. Battles were never one-size fits all, don't always rely on the online playthroughs to find a strategy -- a desperate ploy or whim could turn the tide. Would love to see another PC title for this or even a reboot to kickstart the series again."
"An absolutely fantastic blend of JRPG, RTS, and FPS. Graphics are very good, if not spectacular, the music is solid. The story was enjoyable and pretty unique through most of the game. There is a random plot twist about 1/2 way through that threatens to derail it, but the game manages to right itself near the end. Overall, a great experience and I highly recommend it."
"Great strategy game, although the visuals are obviously outdated. Has some issues being a port but the gameplay and the way the game is presented makes up for it."
"Loved the artwork and story for the PSP version.  The story has a feel like home, that leaves you feeling somewhat satisfied for playing it.  Very calming, but, without being boring."
"It's good, so it is."
"Bonus Points: Japanese audio is selectable (though, the subtitles are based on English dubbed so it's not quite what they're saying.)  From the little I've played so far... Great game. It doesn't make light of war like a lot of games. Within the first few minutes, you see innocent people get gunned down.  The art style is awesome. It's anime cell shaded with a kind of textbook shading style. I love it, and it should age very well.  The interface/GUI is a bit odd, and while the book theme is nice, it distracts a bit from the gameplay. I also had a hard time deciding between mouse/keyboard and my xbox controller. (I'm just not good at aiming with a joystick) I decided on mouse/keyboard.  The combat system is a mixture of live-action and turn based. Very interesting. For the battles, you move your character using WASD or a controller. When it's time to fire your weapon, you have to aim at your enemy manually. During the movement and after you fire at the enemy, they can fire back at you. (Your characters will also fire upon the enemies on the enemy's turn)  I haven't gotten far into the story, but I'm already liking the main characters. If the other reviews hold true to how much character development and storyline this game has, I can see this game being amazing."
"A game with good mechanics.  It is the first game I played that mixes turn based strategy, which is 70% of the game, with action and visual novel. The strategy component is good. You have up to 10 units on the battle fields with 5 different unit types. Positioning is important for both offense and defense. Most of the missions are offensive missions. Boss missions are challenging.  The game turns into action mode when you select a unit. This makes the game fun and unique when you can control your character like a third person shooter. This also gives a sense of urgency which does not exist in pure turn based strategy. For example, after finishing an attack, you will still face crossfire while you look for cover.  Between missions there are animated stories. They did a great job on the animation. It is an enjoyment to watch the story. There is also an anime based on the game, with most of the events similar to what happened in the game.  Music is great. 'Street Fighting' is one of my favorite and I recommend looking for it on Youtube.  I played through the PS3 version a few times. The game has great replayability."
"This game I play for a long time since half year ago, So now I just buy this in RM12.92.Very good game, I want to play more games like this.  Today 26/10/2015, I finish this game, and I feel like want to cry when I see the blackwhite colour photo at the end. This is really a good game.....  You should buy this!"
good port of a good game :p
"Definitely a good port, really wish VC3 would get ported in the same manner, but #SEGA..."
Your best character is a country side girl who loves to bake bread in her spare time and makes cute poses after murdering people.  And guess what? She single handedly saved her entire country from an invasion.  Alicia/10  Bonus point for also being a waifu army simulator
"Will write a more detailed review later, but basically I really enjoyed this game. The gameplay is extremely challenging and fun. The story is mostly predictable and a little cliche, but it's not awful, and by the end of the game, the story's setting and characters had grown on me.  This review is short because Steam forces you to write something in order to rate a game, which is kind of silly. However, I really enjoyed playing this game, so I might come back later and write something more detailed."
"I absolutly love this game, Having a team of Teenage Girls in Armour killing a 'German' style army and literally destorying anything in their way is the best way to make a game. I need this as a Anime to watch!"
"Story is good. Combat is satifying. Music is great. The Challenge in this game is hard. If you have asian blood in your veins then you shall beat every challenge easily. If you are not asian, then you are in trouble my friend, gonna have hard times like me.  9/10"
"Great port and well executed. This is a game you'll want to play to have the experience of playing it. There isn't anything quite like it out there.  However, if you're a perfectionist in your games, you might get annoyed.  In order to get the most bang for buck out of your missions, you'll need to get H Rank and if you're a person like me, you'll sit there over and over trying to get the coveted rank on your first playthrough. It is more fun to enjoy the game as is and not shoot for the best rank."
Unique blend of TBS and action. Great story which features alternate Europe and World War. If you like Japan cultury you will like this game.
a Turn Base TPS game ~ u need a good tatic and know the situation of the enemy on every map and good story in there too~ :3 10/10
"This game feels a bit like what would happen if you took worms 3D, made it better, and then combined the product with a JRPG.  A great 3D turn based combat game with an in depth array of character upgrades/ weapon ugrades that actually have a strong effect on how well you'll do in each level.  The story, I actually enjoyed it lot, I liked the characters, the levels were designed rather well, the AI on the enemies were difficult to beat in some early levels but once you learn the mechanics of the game they became quite easy to trick and beat.  The graphics, well, the models could be better for a 2014 released game but they're still pretty good nevertheless. I believe they went for a cell shaded graphics scheme to compliment the manga roots of the game, I happen to like cell shaded graphics, the deliberate animated feel of the graphics usually ages pretty well.  My final point is that this is a console port, and as a console port not only does the game support a controller, I would strongly recommend you use one, the keyboard and mouse controls just aren't as well suited to this game's control scheme.  All in all, a great game about 10 hours of gameplay completed the game for me and I'm going through the campaign again to get some better scores, it's still as fun as when I started."
Cool hybrid game. Wish there was an updated sequel as it definitaly shows it was an old console game but still worth the asking price.
"I've been looking for a game similar to Nintendo's Fire Emblem for a while. Comparing this game to Fire Emblem makes me want to expand my horizons to other games with this type of simple turn-based strategy (I've found Civilization games to be way too confusing). It's not grid based. Instead, you explore an open field as a unit, rather than point and go there. It still manages to keep all the simple strategy that I liked in Fire Emblem."
This game is touching and I haven't even managed to finish it yet. Wanting to make sure everybody lives kinda slows you down.
"In all honesty i cannot give a review of the actual game as i couldnt even get to play it.  I first had to battle through the configuration window where it was endlessly cycling through my multitude of connected input devices (gamepad, joystick &amp; throttle, orbweaver keypad, keyboard and mouse) and randomly changing options. I thought i had eventually narrowed this down to the throttle as when i moved it the option cycling stopped and i configured the game to use keyboard &amp; mouse as primary input.  I loaded in to the game, watched the boring into and was once again confronted with automatic menu scrolling despite having configured for mouse and keyboard. It was at this point i quit and uninstalled.  I am not willing to disable/unplug all my USB devices every time i want to play the game. This is an awful playstation port and feel somewhat ripped off despite getting this from humblebundle!"
"Beautiful soundtrack, beautiful art, wonderful story, and entertaining gameplay. I must admit there are times where I get upset at the real time aspects as they are a bit unfair and random, but otherwise, I really enjoy this game. It has a nice challenge to it and the characters are a joy to see interact. It has a lot of similar aspects to that of Fire Emblem games. It has some good battle strategy that you can pick up on. Overall it is a 10/10 game for me. I love this game!"
"Great story: 10/10 Great art: 10/10 Great gameplay: 9.5/10 Great replay value: 9/10  Turn-based strategy with real-time character action. Very intuitive and great way of strategy gameplay.  The only minus is that there's not enough randomness in skirmish mode, everything is preset."
"Fun game with a great balance between action and strategy. As with FF games, the story can get a little cumbersome at times, but overall adds a human dimension."
"Pros: -Story. Has a somewhat complex and immersive plot, which is all too uncommon for video games these days. -Anime style. Works well even if you aren't an anime fan. -Quality of actual gameplay (not cutscenes). Unique and fun. Strategy is decently deep as you'll actually have to THINK before making a decision. -Tutorials are very informative, but don't hold your hand or treat you like you've never gamed before. And yes, you will want to view them, as the game has a bit of a learning curve (not a bad thing, but actually fun exploring your different options).  Cons: -Lack of actual gametime. Battles are too short and cutscenes are too long. I'd like more action. -Some anime cliches present. Kind of annoying. What do you expect, though?  Overall, it's a great interactive anime (I hesitate to call it a full-blown game), but it's not for some people, like those who just want to get to the action. 8/10 personally."
"As this is a great game about War and Sorrow, with a nice new idea of Strategy Turn-based RPG, I strongly recommend setting the voice to Japanese as the English voiceover is sometimes misleading ('Bocchan (young master) is translated to Welkies, nii-chan (big brother) is Welkies as well). Also Japanese in this game can demonstrate all of the emotions whereas English sounds crappy and stiff.  Have fun playing the game ^^"
love this game!! got it again on steam caus i love id so much!
save and load during battle
"I dont like tactical turnbased games but i enoyed this on the 360, so i bought it on steam."
i ran over a squad member with my tank on accident and they didn't die  gunther/10
"I'm not really good at reviewing games but trust me, this game is excellent!"
"A MUST have for anyone who's into the Turn-Based Strategy Genre. Aaaand, if you so happen to be someone who likes a good JRPG here and there, you'll be more than satisfied with this one. Guaranteed."
"bought this game a while back and forgot about it, just got around to playing it and it's already one of my favorite games of all time."
"One of the best games I have ever played! I was not ready for the amount of story being delivered through movies and cut scenes, so at first I thought is a bit tedious. Later on however, it really hooked me and I enjoyed the story as much as the action. The graphics and sound is amazing and it is something you have to experience! The only thing I have to complain about is the god awful tank controls."
combination RPG with Third person shooter its very amazing
"Have you ever sat there and thought: ' Damn, I wish there was a half strategy/half TPS pseudo-WW2 video game with an anime artstyle where majority of the allied forces are actually cute girls '?  Yes? Then this is the game for you.  The port itself is fine, the game runs well and looks good, all the DLC is also included for free with the PC version. What else could you want?    Marina is best girl."
"This game is so good that I'm writing my first review.   Combat System: An interesting blend of tactical RPG and a bit of action. You have an overhead map and select a unit to use, then move that unit around in semi-real time to attack and perform other tasks. Very well balanced offering a challenge to those accustomed to this kind of tactical RPG without being too hard for those new to the play style. It really encourages using different tactics to complete your objective and building on what you learned in the previous missions.  Story: Starts out a bit slow, ramps up in the middle and made me all misty eyed at the end. The amount of connection I had with the characters snuck up on me. It doesn't win any awards for being very creative but the story is told very well and in a unique presentation. It takes a story about war and makes it all about the individuals in a squad of militia and what they mean to each other.   If you like RPGs, anime and/or great stories about people then this one is for you."
"I never really liked turn-based games. But then some games sjust do it really well, and have also top notch plot that makes it all completely worth it.  Valkyria Chronicles is one of those games. It has some really excellent characters and good story. One of those games I still find myself thinking about, when I've finished them long time ago.  Loved it on PS3, still loved it on PC"
"At first i thought i was becoming a hipster zombie when i both bought and played this game thinking, oh wow, japan trying to make an uber kawaii seriouschu game of an environment and era representing WWII era Europe.  Then it happened, i started playing it and my inner hipster zombie was going 'no', another hour in, 'NO!' then for even longer, 'NOOOOOOOO!' then my hipster zombie self got headshot by both Guenther Welkins and realization that pessimism only makes you a cynical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who should enjoy life rather than criticize it 24/7 for some smug sense of superiority that didn't even exist in the first place.  Excuse me while i put away my soap box  Sorry i like to make my reviews a little bit amusing with awkward tangents so that in some interesting- whoa! caught myself there  Anyway, awesome strategy game that took a unique approach. If you like games like Final Fantasy Tactics, XCOM, and World War 2 era stories with a sense of first person shooting?  DA TAAA! buy this and enjoy."
"Fun game, great aestetics, recommmeded if you like cute girls shoooting up soldiers in ful armor"
"This is an incredibly fun strategy rpg story game. It has few flaws, but overall it is great for what it is."
So far this game has been absolutely amazing. I'm sucked into it's story and the unique way you play this game really makes it all the more awesome. I'd recommend it to anyone.
"I heard this was a console port, but not having a console to play on, I was expecting a turn-based war strategy game with a bunch of jumpy, perky anime characters, and it delivered a quality product. There are small problems with the port, but the low price of the game does not make me too picky about it. I would expect better out of a full priced title, were it the case that this game was relatively new.  That said, it had just the right mix of storytelling and well-designed challenging combat missions to keep me busy for a while."
This is a very good game. I am a huge fan of turn based tactical games and this one took the cake. Some missions are really frustrating but very rewarding when done. The AI is sometimes easy or sometimes annoying depending on what mission you are on. Overall this game is a good game and the creators of Skies of Arcadia really knocked this game out of the park.
"Game with great story.  The gameplay split in to command mode (overview) and action mode (third person view) where player and AI take turn controlling it's troops and each have diverse potential and class system.  Altough it's a strategy game, there's RNG involved even after you accurately aim for the enemy troop, so save often. (Yes, you can save each turn when in command mode.)"
"I previously owned this game on PS3 and bought it again for PC because of the obvious improvements.  It is a great game, turn based strategy where you pick your squad from a variety of different class types and have a tank to control too.   Pros - Great turn based gameplay - Pick and choose a squad, each member has perks and preferences of other members. - Simple but effective graphics style with excellent performance. Not many graphics settings but the game isn't demanding.  - Lots of content to get through. - Upgrades and levelling up squad classes.  Cons - Story is mediocre and have to get through a few cutscenes before getting into combat scenarios. - No mouse support in the menus, can be annoying but it can be used when in game which is something at least. "
Very fun game. Good Story. Well made cutscenes. Enjoyable gameplay. There is not many games like this out there.
Played it a lot on PS3 and this is a different kind of SRPG. It's pretty good overall with main flaws being the rating system and some characters being obviously better than others. Don't overlook it because of the artstyle. It goes on sale often so wait for a sale.
"The game is quite good, but some missions are just downright frustrating thanks to some graphically glitches that will extend a wall causing you to miss shots that should have been hits.  Story wise, its your typical anime thrown into a world war 1/2 with medievalish armor esque era.  Do I recommend this game having played many other strategy games? No. At the same price, there are better games out there in the strategy genre.  Do I recommend this game if you want something different than your normal strategy game (Total War Series, COH, etc.)? Yes, but grab it on sale. For the $8 I paid, I definately got my money's worth."
"In all seriousness, this is a really fun game. It provides plenty of laughs, smiling cringes, and plenty of strategy.  The only problem that I have with this are these things below.  Minor annoyances, but one can overlook these: 1. the cutscenes aren't cutscenes, you have to select and play them via selection. 2. The enviroment's clipping can be irritating sometimes 3. Your units have the perfect shot, but they miss it when they fire their gun.  Major annoyance 1. YOUR TANK WILL WOBBLE AND TURN EVERYWHERE. Once you balance your tank after that spasm attack, you can only move like 1 inch and then you end your turn. "
"I watched the anime long time ago and I liked it. Maybe that caused that neccessity of mine of playing the game from which the anime came from, and I did it. (I think I was not very accurate with my grammar, but nevermind). The fact of being able to manage gear and equipment of your soldiers is very catchy. And well, I may be attracted to the main character because I am a biologist too. :3     *SPOILER ALERT* I don't like too much this concept of Valkyrias, but the game mechanics and lore are awesome.   I recommend this game. :D"
Im sad that I wont be able to play it again for the first time  8/8
I played a hole chapter...Forgot to save gg
i thought this would be a fast pased shooting game in this awesome art style but its turned based kinda slow good story
"It's Fire Emblem with guns and somehow more weeaboo'ish. Haven't played much, but I know I'll like it from what little I played. Give it a try!"
"Valkyria Chronicles is a game with fantastic gameplay, and maybe even a decent story, if you can get past the atrocious script and very anime-esque. . . everything.  The main gameplay element, the BLiTZ system, is actually fairly interesting and fun to play, combining TBS tactics and Action RPG fun. I found myself wondering if a similar system might be beneficial for other games, which seems like a star in VC's book. The fact that each individual soldier at your command came with a backstory and unique set of traits, even ones that had no story significance whatsoever (and that's a lot) was also impressive, and it made me want to keep everyone alive.  The biggest problem I had with this game was its awful, AWFUL script. It's sometimes cute, but worth cringing at at least half the time. Character personalities and motivations also end up being pretty flat, but there's at least enough to kee[ the ball rolling; it's not Star Ocean bad. The Steam port suffers from a couple of glitches, but nothing I found was immediately game breaking, so hopefully you won't have any problems either. If you don't mind cheesy dialogue and anime out of every orifice, then this game is fun the whole way through, and I entirely recommend it."
Have to be a hardcore animu kawai desu to enjoy this boring... I guess shooter ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ If you squint really hard and turn your head it looks a bit like a strategy game.
"Genocidal war dominated by mostly underaged Girl Scouts.  What more can you ask for?  SPOILER: A team of: Alicia, Aika, Freesia, Nancy, Susie, Eddy, Dallas, Audrey. A bunch of psychopath, sadistic, underaged girls aged 12-19, took out tanks, turrets, and armies. Everytime they murder someone, they strike a cute pose going 'Yehey' Scariest of them all is Nancy who feels 'tingly inside' and recovers full health after slaughtering someone. Lets not forget Alicia, a 19 year old baker who just waltz around the enemy fortress like nothing, tanking Selvaria's gattling gun like a boss, and both her and Aika covering half the whole map in just 1 action.  VC2 &amp; 3 on steam please."
"Great game. The bad voice acting is typical of any JRPG. The game seems to suffer from some porting optimization issues but hey, who needs anti-aliasing when you're playing a tactical RPG, am I right?"
"alicia : as of today you're a member of squad 7, little guy. piglet : boink... boiiink...  btw... the piglet doesn't have tentacle "
"To put it simply, a truly delightful game."
best game I've played since skies of Arcadia - love everything about it. There are a lot of cut scenes (I like those but some don't) its far more linear than Arcadia but thats fine - been a while since i took a day out to sit play solidly dawn till dusk but this one did it for me
It goes along as a wonderful story being told with you getting into bouts of commanding combat. In combat you seem to always have the one tank and a few foot troops. It lets you choose who goes on the battlefield allowing for some preferences. Only down side is that most of the story battles have some 'secret'. This is an issue with scripted missions. They can have this neat secret in them but its only new the first time you fight it. Once you figure out a way to beat a secret you probably wont find the same secret on another boss.  There is also a skirmish mode that is free of the story lines so you can just fight and not have those special condtions. I would like to see them make a tactical focus game with more battle maps and less story lines. Certainly a good buy. Enjoying it as a Holiday season days off tour of fun.
"Game is awesome, 20€ with all the DLC is a steal. The system is pretty odd at first but it's easy to get used to after a couple of battles, the extra challenges coming in the DLC's are pretty hard, but in the case of the Class' challenges, they give you overpowered equipment, which in most cases you can stack. But it's OK since the game still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ts you in a couple of levels putting you on front of unkillable bosses and stuff like that. It does offer Newgame+ where you start with all of what you got from before by default and you can select a harder difficulty level for skirmishes, awesome stuff.  All in all, a very interesting tactics, I wish they could remaster Valkyria Chronicles 3 and bring it to PC, but unfortunately Japanese Companies aren't big on this remastering stuff so..."
"This game is an absolute masterpeice. At its heart it is a Squad combat game with turn based combat set during a fictional war in the 1930s in an alternative universe. However with the glorious shaded watercolor style graphics, wonderful story line and a whole host of interesting characters it is SO much more than just another Squad Shooter.  Despite the cartoony manga like Art style their are some really thorny moral issues at play here along with an in your face look at the realities of War, the Death of innocents and just what people will do in pursuit of resources. Your squad mates can be drawn from an ever increasing pool of recruits and draftees ranging from Oldsters, Teenagers and young Adults.  I won't spoil any of the surprises in store for you other than to say that there is a system in place called `Potentials` which can range from a hatred of the enemy leading to increased attack right trhough to a fear of being alone thus leading to decreased defence all of which force you to think very tactically during battles.  Suffice to say you really ought to add this Gem to your library and experience what Sega can do at their very best.  Below is a quick clip showing one of the Potentials (Imp Hater) in action and just how effective these can be.   https://youtu.be/RQy7FaYqn00 "
My Fist Play is Good Games I Not Like Game Play And Not Hate I Like Story Look Like Anime this i like and me VERY NEED SEE Valkyria Chronicles II AND Valkyria Chronicles III on PC remake

"you're japan that's secretly switzerland in WW2, japan is the jews and you are switzerland. You fight russia who secretly is just the evil empire but it's totally just russia/germany hybrid. You are a bread maiden who must help her husbando who owns a tank for some reason save switzerland from both germarussia and the west. It's really good. also it has music from the same people that did FFT so it's automatically a good game "
"One of my favourite games in steam library.Dear GOD, bring to steam the other parts of this saga.I pray to you with all my heart.Action figures of this game are all over my room"
"I bought this game because of the unique combination of a first person shooter turn based format. The gameplay is unique and I enjoyed it. The story is pretty good, however, it can be lengthy. That being said the gameplay is also pretty lengthy, battles could take an hour or so maybe more. That didnt bother me too much because it is a pretty solid game. The characters were personal although at times too unrealistic. The weapons/experience was pretty basic but didnt get in the way. 7.5/10"
"i know you guys probably will want to but dont make an all waifu team. Seriously its so  f ucking bad. Game is great though, would recommend a buy!"
I recommend this game.
This game has an AMAZING story.   It is an interesting play through; all story with player controlled combat in each chapter.  I love the artwork done in the game. It is hard to put to words a good description of the game so the short and simple above is what I will leave it at. I most whole-heartedly recommend the game with 30-50+ hours of game play its definitely worth the purchase.
"I pick up a lot of games on a whim, usually only doing enough research to find out 1) if I'd be interested in them, and 2) if they're actually worth my money. I've had plenty of disappointments as a result, and I've also had my fair share of mehs, but it's a very rare, very special experience when one of these games completely surpasses my expectations in almost every way.  Out of those rare instances, it's even more special if that game—that random, unassuming purchase—goes on to become one of my favorite games of all time. So special, in fact, that it's only happened twice in my life.  First with Okami. And second, yes indeed, with Valkyria Chronicles.  Beneath its warm and fuzzy anime style and absolutely gorgeous art direction lies one of the most compelling turn-based Strategy RPGs ever crafted, and what many have gone on to cite as one of the single greatest games to ever release on the PS3. Valkyria Chronicles is the rare breed of game that I can say is truly worthy of being called 'special'; something that *needs* to be experienced; a title that deserves every ounce of praise it gets. If you've never experienced this game, then you've got nothing to lose.  May the bloodline live forever. Squad 7, move out!"
Great Game
"Weeb War 2™ I don't really do the whole JRPG thing but Valkyria Chronicles is amazing. If you've played Fire Emblem, Advance Wars etc then imagine that but also with some XCOM thrown into the mix."
"The game is half story/half turn based tactical and both are done very well. The story is done well enough that you don't mind going through the 4-5 story episodes (they're pretty short) to get to each mission. The missions are very fun, ranging from relatively easy to very difficult. On the difficult missions, one mis-step (literally one step too far or not far enough) can mean failure. Luckily you can save regularly because some of the surprises during the missions can feel a bit unfair and if you haven't saved in a while, that can be very frustrating and cost you quite a bit of extra time getting back to where you were. But the game is so good, and the story is done so well, that it won't make you stop playing.  I'm not an Anime fan but this game trancended that aversion and really is a game not to miss."
"It has its flaws, but it is quite a good game. If you don't mind being labeled a weeabo by your friends, its definitely worth $7."
"I dunno. Not really a strategy game as much as a puzzle game. Pretty rare to be able to do a mission without knowing the EXACT way to beat it for that perfect score.  Far prefer games like XCOM, Jagged Alliance etc.  Really good story. Just too much like a puzzle game for my tastes."
Tank rounds loaded? Check. Sniper rifle calibrated? Check. Rocket launcher ammo installed? Check. Mine detector set operational? Check. Flame thrower upgraded? Check. Remove bread from the oven before the Imperial Invasion? I knew I forgot something!!!
Nice game if u love turn based games with guns not very bloody (so far i only finished chp. 1) worth it if u want more story with some nice 3rd person gun play
"This is a story; a novel of the events you are playing through. Gameplay is only half of what makes up Valkyria Chronicles. The other half consists of fully voiced and animated skits that explain the daily lives of what the soldiers are going through. It ranges from discrimination, comaraderie, love, and unfortunately death. Watching and hearing the events unfold definitely made me think more about how black and white war can be made out to be. Another portion of that half consists of a 'sim' aspect where the player can upgrade weapons, soldier classes, and tanks through a tree-based upgrade system. Classing up soldiers can yield them learning special skills and a new title even. Characters can be recruited and dropped from the current roster at anytime so there's no fear of losing a favorite if they're not needed so swap away. A very welcome touch this game brings to thee table is that every character has a bio and major characters have bios that continuously update as the player progresses through the story. Not only that, you can view their different outfits, if applicable so if you wanted to make a replica or just see them up close. Feel free. Music is top notch. Some familiar faces from a certain Dreamcast/Gamecube port make appearances. I highly recommend this for anybody who enjoy the likes of Advance Wars, Fire Emblem or likes JRPG's in general."
like tanks? like anime? like turn based combat? this is what you are probably wanting to play.
"This game is amazing. In a short time this has become one of new favorite games. It is compared to XCOM alot but they didn't feel overly similar to me. I can't recommend this game enough!!! The  +Visually pleasing, especially if you enjoy anime. +Turn Based but you don't have to move on tiles!!! WHAT?! It's great how this is handled. You're free to run and aim in 3rd person using an energy bar for your turn. Shooting still ends your turn.  +The movement part of the turn is still exciting. Your soldiers will still shoot at approaching enemies during the enemy phase. Which also means you'll be dodging enemy fire on your turns.  +Voice Acting and personality traits for individual units. I like the way this was done. You discover the traits during play, they change how you   -Some missions have dumb preset 'suprises'. This makes them stupidly difficult. Once you've played a mission and seen what's coming it is easier to handle. You can retry easily once you fail."
What I wanted  - Cool art - Turn based combat  What I got  - Soap Opera - Infuriating combat
"Love the story, music and the characters.  10/10"
"If you play strategy games, perhaps you know what I mean when I say that playing a strategy game is like being a relationship with someone you REALLY like, but who has one or several traits that annoy you because they remind you of a previous girlfriend who did those same annoying things. The problem is that the rest of the relationship is really good and you don't want to break it off--but you can't stand those annoying traits so it creates problems every time they come up. You two are an on-again, off-again couple and everybody thinks it's not going to work out, until you finally get sick of those awful traits.  Just when you've broken things off with Strategy--this time, for good, you swear--this other girl walks in the door and you realize immediately she has all the amazing traits of your former ex-girlfriend (we'll call her 'FPS') and all the awesome traits of your recently-made ex girlfriend (her name is 'Strategy'), and yet this new girl seems to have none of the flaws of either.  To put the icing on the cake, she isn't what most people would describe as 'beautiful' or 'stunning,' but to you she has a unique enough appearance that as time goes on you are remarkably attracted to her and yet feel she is completely approachable and not trying too hard to be beautiful, which is all the more attactive to you. Without knowing how or when it happened, you realize you two have gotten close--closer than you intended, you never meant to rebound--so you decide to start dating this new girl.  Things go strangely at first; you're not sure it's working out, but you're not sure it isn't. You're always worried that she's got something underneath the surface that is going to let you down, you just haven't seen it yet. Sure, she is kind of goofy at times, but you secretly like it and enjoy being able to be yourself without feeling judged, so you decide to go with it. Time passes, and you decide that in spite of whatever may be wrong with this new girl or what flaws she has, you love her in spite of, or maybe because of, those flaws, and that you find them acceptable because you just love spending time together and can't imagine her not in your life anymore.  After a while, however, you just wish there was more you could do together, like hang out with eacht other's friends while you're together. Sometimes your routines are a bit dull, so after a while you two just drift apart...  That, my friends, is Valkyria Chronicles.  TL:DR Worth every penny, play the campaign a couple times, then set aside for a while until you feel nostalgic."
"A very addicting anime game. There's a lot of cut scene so don't buy the game if you don't like it. Easy control using pc but they didn't give you all the controls available so be sure to check that up. Easy achievment, if not check out my guide :p. The art of the game is well made as well as the story is acttractively good. Make sure you don't leave when you beat the game, there is some cut scenes there too ;)"
"I'm only about halfway through the game, but the whole thing is really well made. The story is not too deep, relatable in some ways; Some of the tactics used are similar if not the same as some used in WWII (such as deep fording) and the story mixes in the right scenes at the right times to make a truly memorable story of love, hate, joy, sorrow, peace, and, of course, war. Even when someone dies, I feel like it's better to mourn over their death than to load up an old save. The gameplay is great, though some things could be explained a little better, but overall a 9/10-10/10 game."
"Played at 5 in morning didnt listen to pre mission brieing, didn't place snipers on the cliff won one turn before the limit slept for 2 days before coming back to it always listen to pre mission briefing 10/10."
"Beautiful story, beautiful art. A turn based tactic strategy game with a ..twist? If you like fire-emblem or Final Fantasy Tactics, you... actually, I'm not sure... you'll love it or hate it. It will depend on the gameplay."
"Where do I begin with this game. I'll start with the cons with this game- personally I found it hard to drive the tank and the dialogue with this game I thought it could have been better. Now with the pros- Spectator graphics, awesome game play, found it hard/ challenging, always shouted at my computer screen when I lost any battle, always shouted at my computer screen when I won any battle, the main characters, the side/sub characters, characters in general, the enemies, the bosses, the different battle fields, different classes of soldiers and the upgrading system it had with the tank, weapons and soldiers. I will say at first I wasn't sure about the game play of it, because this is the first time I played a turned-based third person shooter game, but it surprise grew on me and I love it. Hopefully somebody can bring the other Valkyria Chronicles games on steam; I would do anything for that to happen."
"Pros: Great art style Interesting mechanics and gameplay Killing bad guys as a high school bakery girl One of the main charicters voiced by Kakashi Hatake (Dave Wittenberg) Numerous upgrade trees and paths Total squad customization  Con: Crashes that occur at the worst time ( I recommend looking up potential crashes to avoid potentially lost progress and time) Overall, not too many and not too much time lost (so far)  Overall Score: 9/10, would Kakashi again"
"Anime like Strategy war game?... What is there more to ask?.   A great game so far that surely seem to be all you can ask for from a strategy game. Cutscenes... story... and much more.  If you like XCom or simular strategy games you will love this game. It have a rich storyline to boot with character cutscenes... so its really looking nice.   When your able to controll and aim with each of your soldiers yourself and take action one at a time only one thing can be said... GIve me more of this in Strategy games!..   I like this concept.  +Great Graphics and story for a Anime-ish Strategy game.  +Fair enough sounds and sequences that are not really bloody or anything so its really Safe for view.  +Music is just fine.    So far I don't have anything bad to say about this game at all. Perhaps more weapon choices would be a nice option, but I suppose upgrading equipment work.   -/+ So far getting an 'A' rank seem to mean rushing to the objective if there is one, which can make it hard to get unless you want to dodge bullets and skip kills. Sure beating a map in '1' turn because its possible is nice... but it dosen't really feel that cool if you run past 4 enemies on the way and take their flag... I guess in a term of 'sneaking past them and capture their base' work... but... idk.   -? Ai so far seem easy... and there don't appear to be anyway to adjust difficulty settings, which can make the game appear as a walk in the park so far. Really... you have 9 units on a map but use at max 3 because you need to get to places fast and kill stuff and only get a set point of 'CP' command points that you use to move soldiers. =A set amount of actions per turn. Having 9 soldiers dosen't mean you can move 9 times.... it can mean you can move like 6+, but one soldier can move 6 times ect. if they have enough mobility left.   While running freely soldiers will use 'Interception fire' basically meaning that they will shoot at you as long as you move... and can kill you if you don't either end your movement face while they do... or shoot or something in return. Your Soldiers work the same way... which usually result in the Ai running past your gunline and often dying to interception fire.    So my judgement so far is that the Game certainly is great. A bit easy but great. Hope this review is helpful."
"My friend send me this game, and as part of a deal we have I played it to completion. It was terrible. The story was just awful, the characters were tragic tropes, and the gameplay was, at best, lackluster if not beligerently impeding.   It takes a very long time to play a mission in this game and you have to sit through every movement on the enemy's turn with no way to speed up or skip movements.   Every fight is very much in favor of the enemy This includes but is not limited to, more powerful units, inescapable plot traps, infinite spawning enemies, and superior numbers. This howsoever does not actively increase difficulty, but rather just increases mission time.   The AI is so dumb that it is a hassle. I have had 4 enemies run into a tanks machine gun in open ground, inversely I saw a tank ignore two of my tanks, exposing it's insta-kill rear to me, just so it could blow away 2 of my scouts positioned far behind them.   Lastly there is no checkpoint system. You either finish a mission in one shot or do it over. Given the length of the missions, this makes it hard to play in anything more than short sessions. Also there are plot ambushes. Meaning you can complet your objective, not have any movement left, and have an enemy spawn and one shot your commander and force you to redo the whole mission.   The art style was nice though..."
"I really wanted to like this game, as the plot seemed interesting, but honestly the gameplay was just too awful for it to be enjoyable at all. I appreciated the story as far as I've gotten thus far, and I can overlook some of the cheesiness of the characters and their actions, however, every fight feels like a struggle not against enemy units, but against chance. A big point in all of the battles is that the protagonists are fighting against the odds, and are frequently outnumbered and outgunned, but the fact that any move you take can have a high chance of failure makes combat a significant frustration. Your snipers will miss nearly point blank headshots, your lancers will miss tanks all day, and if you try to get close enough to have a good chance of hitting, well then you just ran in to a horde of enemies. And if you try to clear said horde of enemies so that you can approach your enemies in order to have a decent chance of hitting them, then either their tanks will destroy you, or they'll just call for more reinforcements. Now by all means, combat isn't impossible. You can beat most missions in one attempt, even if you're not that great, but the gameplay in and of itself is absolutely frustrating, and unless you grind experience doing skirmishes, you may find yourself irritated when your plan backfires because all of your units missed.  If you can overlook gameplay for story, then I do recommend this game, at least based on how far I've gotten at the time I wrote this review. If you don't find that sort of gameplay discouraging, then I would suggest considering this game, as it certainly has its merits, but personally I cannot stand the frustration of losing by chance, or getting a lower rank purely based on randomness.  As an aside, how the hell does getting hit by a bullet that 'lowers your attack' make your gun or rocket launcher somehow go from killing a tank in 4 shots to killing a tank in 37 shots?"
"This game is a gem.  It is an interesting twist on turn based strategy with the units controlled from an over-the-shoulder, 3rd person perspective. This allows for nuances like taking cover behind your tank or putting a tree between you and a sniper to be viable tactics. The story is an impressive telling of an alternate version of World War 2 from the perspective of a local militia. It keeps you interested and has several good twists. One of the games strongest points is its diversity of missions. While you are using basically the same units each battle, every mission presents you with new and challenging situations. You are forced to come up with new tactics and uses for what you have available to you. While chance elements occationally give you a lucky long shot or a wrench to deal with, tactical positioning and optimized use of resources play a much larger role in victory. The graphics are simple, but have held up very well. They have an elegant, almost painted, look to them. The controls and menus are a little clunky and show signs of their console origin, but are manageable. "
"A very unique and awesome strategy game. A great story, and interesting gameplay mechanics."
Great story and solid gameplay make this classic timeless
"I played this the first time on my PSP with its 480x272 resolution.   Now I get to play at a lovely 1080p, worth it."
"I'm as new as it gets when it comes to Turn-Based games. But:  1. I love Anime related games 2. Graphics are fantastic for my personal preference, some may find them NOT BAD.  Other than that, only thing that bothers me, is that a mission some times takes longer than expected.  Why would i recommend it:   1. It has Anime Girls, killing bad guys. 2. See (1.)."
"Abit of unfairness in the game system, especially enemy can instanly target or end turn even before your soldiers fire at them. However the game can be easily master. The story is quite good somehow more accurate detail like from the book than the anime videos. Good game."
So far I'm really enjoying this gameplay. It's Advanced Wars meets FFXII type hybrid fighting system. I just hate how inaccurate the english transcript is as opposed to what the Japanese audio is saying. It kind of throws me off. The same can be said about the Neptunia series. All in all I can see this game being a 9/10
"It's a brilliant game, I really like it. I don't talk about gameplay or tehnical options or whatever, I base it on amusement and fun. And it is a fun game you should totally get it, I got it on the winter sale and I think I ripped off the company hahaha. But really game is real fun on the beginning until you meet the characters and go through the first 2 or 3 battles is kinda slow and boring because you're getting used to the game but later on when you get to create your squad and recruit new soldiers and fight in the war it is a amazing experience. Totally recommend it if you are having doubts about buying the game, BUY IT!"
Cute girl running in the middle of battlefield tanking all the bullet to take down the enemy flag   10/10 Best strategy ever
"Overall a fun game that I highly recommend. It revolves around cinematics you select right up until a battle. The battle consists of a map, you select a unit, and that unit can only do so much before their 'Action Points' are used up (firing your weapon, running around, etc). You repeat this until you've run out of units to command (measured by 'Command Points').  Pros: - Good English and Japanese dubs. - Fun side-missions you can play repeatedly for higher ranks and more points. - So far a good story.  Cons: - Some cinematics aren't skippable."
Made an all girl squad that kills men easily. 10/10 would kill more men.
"unique gameplay, good story, enjoyable characters and art style is nice to look at."
TFW you spend 8 straight hours playing Restart PC for graphics drivers Game doesn't auto save and doesn't have option to enable it because its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TFW suicide sounds pretty good at that point
"One of the best games I've played in over a decade. Finely tuned, a level of polish you rarely see. The turn-based / real-time combat is pretty incredible."
"This game...i am conflicted...the story isn't half bad,lots of kawai girls and all sorts of dudes to pick from,though let's be honest,you'll probably only end up using a handful of them,(*cough* 9 characters deployed with a 20 unit roster *cough*),anyways,my praises go to how the game is presented,in all forms,sometimes you get a cutscene,sometimes you got closeups of them talking,and even in cobat it gives you a feel of looking through a comic book(as best as i can describe it),as even when you shoot the word 'bata' pops out of tank turrets,per bullet(bata-bata-bata-bata etc),each character presented has their own small piece of development put into them,and trust me,there's A LOT of them,and i didnt find the charater dialogue stupid at all(by this i mean: *main enemy pops out of nowhere with a grand entrance*,*some character proceeds to point out villain name several times because why not*),rather,it got to the point,here's the backstory,this is whats going on now,*insert small piece of character dialogue that shows you how 1 and 2 get along* and this is what you need to do,go do it.  My bone to pick with this game though,is wth the gameplay,its unique,of course,its fun,absolutely,but,more often than not i found my characters being completely incompetent of delivering a bullet when enemies were a 2 feet distance,i cant tell you how many times i had to mak a scout run all the way up a hill,simply to proceed carefully align the gun so the very end is practically pressed against their heads for headshots,simply because i wanted them to die without me having 4 characters shoot like a maniacs from only 10-15 feet away,at least for me,the tank controls are awful,just awful,see,you have this AP bar,let's call it stamina bar,it drains as you run only,you can shoot only a couple of predetermined couple of bullets depending on your class per turn,this includes the tank,your tank has this 'stamina' bar,so,you think:'oh hey,i can simply move forward a bit,stop to take a shot at some enemies and then drive through the curve over there',welllllllll,you could,except your tank turn to face the direction you were aiming at,so,you drive up,you stop,you enter 'aim mode',you take the shot,now proceed to have your tank try to automatically adjust to where you were just looking as you desperately try to get your ***** back together,at this point it's almost like your driver wants to lift the front portion like a bike,and congratulations,you just used up the rest of your 'stamina' hopelessly strugling to get your tank to stop spinning,now if you're like me,and just so happen to have some bad luck thrown in there,this is the part where YOU WILL DIE,as this was your last turn,your tank's butt is exposed,and this one jack-*** shoots his equivalent of a bazooka from all the way across the map,miraculously hitting your one weak spot,and you tank blows up in only one shot,GAME OVER,yes,tank dies,you lose,at least in most cases.  it's a fun game,for sure,but i warn you,be prepared to get your butt savagely smacked on harder than when you played the dark souls series."
"I played the sequel on psp part II was amazing I loved it still one of my favorite games to date but this one, when it came out on ps3 and pc it blew me away 10/10 would play again"
"I had this game for the Playstation 3 when it first came out. I played it some, but I got diverted to other stuff. I picked this up on a recent humble sale. It is so worth it. The story so far is really great. The characters already have a lot of growth. My only real complaint are the soldiers you use that don't really matter to the story. There are a few that are story based, but the majority of your squad are just no names(they have names but this is a point I am making) that are there only for the fight. In games like this I prefer the characters to all matter. Games like Vandal Hearts are like that. Other than that, this game is a winner."
There are very few games that are memorable. This is one of them.  A must play title.
just buy it
Best $5 I ever spent on steam (and that says something). If you are a fan of RPG's and strategy games in general then you shouldn't miss this one. A true gem that I wish someone told me about much earlier.
"Fantastic gmae, probably never going to finish it though, as steam decided, for what ever reason, to overwrite my save file with another file from weeks beforehand."
"Great story, mixed between war and love, with good gameplay is combined of FPS and RTS, the game is really good in some aspect, but i recommend you to buy them"
"Although I'm not done the game yet, it is definetely worth buying this whether on sale or not on sale.  Essentially the story is a spinoff of WW2 using anime to cover up some of the harsh themes commonly seen in war games. Despite this, it still provides a gripping story from the loss of your home to the final battle. After each battle you can see the characters develop with the progression of the story.  All in all there are 20 chapters in the main story with DLC and new game+ which I've heard is much more difficult in terms of enemy AI and such.  If you enjoy RPGs with some Visual Novel-esqe storyline, this is definetely a game you should try.  PS: Just watch out for those snipers. They hurt a lot."
Light romance mixed into a violent war story topped off with Anime super-saiyan'ism. Honestly one of the best games I've played lately.
"    World War II inspired, but with teenagers who have a tank in their shed. Cause, ya know, who  doesn't  have the world's most advanced tank in their shed?     Everyone has their own unique traits, likes &amp; dislikes, including people they like (and don't like) fighting with, granting bonuses &amp; occasionally negative effects. They're also audible about this, and everything else!     Traditional Strategy except that each units turn is done in real-time wth full unit movement and actions controlled solely by the payer. By far one of the best features.     One of your Lancers (anti-tank) is flamboyantly homosexuality, and like many other units, has some hilarious random interactions with other units (and get, he gets a boost whenever near other males! Sweet!)     You have a big 'ol Tank. Just the one. Which can nlast baddies with its cannon, its mounted machine guns, or a sweet mortar, cause, ya know, it isn't a war until your tank is more diversely armed than John Rambo!     No stats or attrubutes to level up, but all equipment is fully customizable and upgradeable, and 'Drilled' to level up unuts to learn/earn new traits.     Some of your units are allergic to roads and cities. Awesome.     Tactically open, with a good variety of troop types and abilities, allowing you to make your own approach in most every mission. Having the ability to swap out your deployment teams in the field as the mission evolves!    Pay a reporter to write articles about how awesome you are, and I guess your team, which raises moral or something... But I mean, who cares, you're bribing the media to make yourself famous! Can't lose there!     Meet up with a random anonymous old man in the cemetery that talks in poetic sentences and give you skills every once in a while... If only be gave you candy too...     You're pretty much killing Storm Troopers, with slightly modified armour.     The medic, which you never see on the battlefield, uses a top-secret technology that allows her to magically appear, run to the wounded through any obstruction and extract &amp; heal them in full all within about 2.5 seconds!    Your CO is  hot  and constantly loses clothes for some reason.     All in all, is one of my favourites!"
Who doesnt like this game is a ♥♥♥♥!
"Almost everything about  Valkyria Chronicles  is perfect. There are no issues with the port from the original console version. The painterly style of the Canvas engine gives it a uniquely beautiful look. The setting - an alt-universe version of Europe in WWII with some fantasy elements - is refreshingly original. The story's well-written, and the characters are deep and believable. Even the rank-and-file soldiers in your squad who aren't important to the plot have names, backstories, quality voice acting, and personality traits that affect their combat performance. And the core mechanic of classic turn-based strategy combined with real-time third-person controls that put you right in the action is simply brilliant. It's even got plenty of replay value, with a new game plus mode and challenge missions.  So, what mars it? Just two things. One, the AI is incredibly stupid. It's depressingly easy, for example, to get enemies to kill each other by drawing an enemy soldier's fire and taking cover behind another enemy. And two, scouts eventually become overpowered - but that's only a big issue in new game plus. Should you start thinking, though, that cheap exploits make the game too easy, you've always got the expert skirmishes and bonus missions in the DLC to give you the experience of playing with severe handicaps."
"If you are a JRPG fan, if you like to get involved in a game the way titles like Final Fantasy or Fire Eblem did, If you like to plan your moves and thoughts, If you still enjoy action, if you are a fun of war games that consider much more than the battlefield but also the people that fight wars.  this is the game for you.  Oh not the best strategical game ever but it's enjoyable by amateurs and it's still very very fun to play."
Just an awesome Tactic Game...  11/10 would buy again
Why haven't you bought this already?!
"Solid turn based battle system, interesting plot and characters, refreshing art style and music and most of all a great port, what's not to like?   One of the best and most fun JRPGs in years!"
"AWESOME game, one of the best i have ever played."
Great game.. 10/10..
The first time I played this was my first try at this sort of game and I have to say I have no regrets! Valkyria chronicals is definately a favorite of mine now!
This is a fantastic game. The gameplay is fun and it provides just the right amount of challenge without becoming frustrating. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys turn based combat or cutscenes.
"If you are a fan of XCOM, Final Fatasy Tactics, Mass Effect and Squad mangement games. This game is for you. The music, animation, stroy, and gameplay of this game is top notch. Squad customization allows for changing of builds and the story is solid and heartwarming. One of the best games out there and the replay value is also very good. Nor is the game short and if you have not bought this game yet, you are missing out."
"It is basicly an old nintendo style game. I can see how people can get into it. If you are more into actual game play, this game isnt for you. 15 years ago, I could have recommended this game."
Cry everytime. TFW no VC 3 on PC.
"Beautiful graphics, novel gameplay, interesting (albeit clichéd and somewhat nauseating) storyline.  I wanted to play the game more, I thought it was a tactical squad game but with a beautiful anime story in place of a grizly, realistic war scene. But the game penalizes spending time to secure locations and advancing your squad safely, putting more emphasis on completing the objectives in the least turns possible. This means more often than not, the most efficient way to complete a mission with full ratings is for a lone scout (sometimes 2) to simply dash to the objective, ignoring the hoards of trigger-happy enemy soldiers in-between, while the rest of your squad just sit where they spawned like stunned cattles. That really broke immersion, and I haven't been able to bring myself to finish the game despite wanting to see the story progress.  I don't hate the game, it has a lot of promise aside from the major flaw in gameplay concept. But the way they want us to play it, it really encourages players to exploit the system for a high rating. That's where we see videos of a war effectively won single-handed by a lone over-powered scout. For tactical squad games, I really like the way X-Com implemented it. X-Com encourages you to put your squad members safety above completing missions in the shortest time for arbitrary reasons. And 'X-Com:Enemy Within' introduced melds which also required players to take risks for a time-crucial objective; but players decide if it's worth putting their squad members at risk for it or if the danger out-weighs the gain."
"This game is a classic. The music, the artwork, the story, the gameplay, it's fantastic."
"This game is actually so amazing. It's pretty much got all the aspects of the Fire Emblem series, except you're able to move freely with WASD, which really adds something special to the game. I'd definitely recommend trying this game out. There's story galore and the anime-style is pretty much something everyone can enjoy!"
Not as bad as i think good job!
"Valkyria Chronicles looks like a WW2 inspired anime spin-off, but don't let it deter you if that’s not your thing. The game has so much to offer, and it rarely gets anything wrong.   The gameplay has you as a battlefield commander. At the start of each level, you place your troops at a spawn point. As you progress, you capture more spawn points, allowing you to re-deploy your troops if they’re too far behind from the front. It is turn based, and in third-person perspective, so when your turn arrives you choose a unit to control from the game map (which depletes a number of your 'command points'; costs vary per unit), move it to a location and kill an enemy or capture an objective. Once your command points are all used up, your turn is over. How far you can move a unit depends on that unit’s AP – “action points” - and that is where the tactical and strategic game comes in. Every unit’s move counts, so you need to think ahead before you get outmanoeuvred by the enemy.   There’s a selection of different unit classes you can compose your squad from: Snipers, who specialize in long range takedowns; Engineers, who restock ammunition and fix your vehicles; Lancers, who are rocket launching heavy weapons specialists, essential for anti-vehicular combat; Shock Troopers, who are your bread and butter assault classes, handy for clearing out enemy personnel in tight spaces; and lastly Scouts, who are lightly-armoured reconnaissance units and have the farthest range of movement. Choosing your squad composition is no joke. Your victory lives and dies upon it. Oh, and I forgot to mention you are supplied with a tank, which is the slowest moving unit in the game, yet has the most health and armour, and is fully customizable. This unit is essential – Welkin, the game’s hero, commands it. If it’s destroyed, it’s an instant game over.    Each squad member is unique. Not confined to just the main cast, there are over 60, and they each have their own model, personalities, histories, voices and stats - some of them, for a quick example, may not get along with women or men, they may even dislike being around Engineers; this will negatively impact their combat efficiency as part of the squad. But these negative traits almost always come with a bonus, giving you further tactical and strategic considerations. As you level up, research, and develop new equipment, these negative traits become almost negligible.    This might sound complicated now, but worry not. The gameplay is a marvel. It is easy to pick up and understand, yet has extreme depth of play and strategy. On some maps, you can win the game in a single turn if you play your cards right. On others, a little more thinking is required, but even if things go south, you can be sure there’s always a way out if you think hard enough.    Valkyria Chronicles has a wonderful cast of characters, all rendered beautifully in the distinctive Canvas engine (which Sega really needs to make more use of). Their stories are human stories, simple lives interrupted by the looming threat of war; they are a bunch of ragtag individuals fighting not just for their nation, but for each other and their homes. At some points you will genuinely feel for the cast, and I got emotional more than once.    The game is very well paced, going from minor skirmish battles to fully fledged combat zones once you’ve cut your teeth. And the story too is similarly well paced. You are given just enough in the form of character interactions and world events to eagerly look forward to the next breadcrumb.  The soundtrack is fantastic. It really sets the mood, and is never inappropriate.    There’s really not much else I can tell you about this game, except that it’s fantastic! You should really buy this title, it’s a great investment if you have free time that needs spending!  And once you hit the game’s finale, you better get ready for waterworks!"
I was going to write a review on this game. But after the first two pages it was a little long winded. I can't say enough good things about this game. Stop reading this and buy it! Go kick ♥♥♥!
"[X] You like XCOM/Fire Emblem-type game [X] You like anime art style [X] You have 2.5$  This game awesome, art is good and gameplay simple and not confusing. The story is a bit plain but still good to follow. For 2.5 dollars, its too good."
One of my favorite games of this genre. The gameplay is smooth and the plot is more compelling than most.
"A wonderful game for anyone who enjoys strategy games or RPG's. A really unique art style, great music and story. The gameplay is also really unique and enjoyable; combining both elements of a third-person action game and turned based strategy rpg together."
"In reality I am pretty neutral about this game but it would be rude to give it a Negative.  The story is OK... there are some cute bits but it is ultimately the typical cookie-cutter stlye of story that you see pop up in most Japanese Anime. It was well done though and was good enough to make for mostly interesting viewing.  The battles were OK too, in the main. I was actually drawn to this game by playing Mordheim where someone pointed out that the battle there was similar to this game - it was a good call.  The biggest problems for me with the battles were the arbitrary nature of some of the attacks. I would set up defences and the enemy would waltz by without being attacked, on the other hand their reaction fire was very very reactive. Also some of the battles were difficult... until you knew the 'trick' of the level... then they were rediculously easy (the final battle with Selvaria Bles being a perfect example... )  I played it through to the end, had some enjoyable moments but really just played the last 3-4 Chapters out of a sense of completion.  It was good but not great and well worth buying on Sale"
"Very well made Round-based strategy game, driven by a story. The stroy is well told in the comic like cutscenes and the characters are interesting and likeable. I can recommend this."
"Its not a bad game, I played it in the original launch, and managed to mash my way though the myriad number of game killing CTD bugs that occured frequently enough to be ultra annoying.  Can't recommend it due to the port being poorer than original"
Valkeria Chronicles  I cleared this game on the PS3 and loved it and then got it for the PC and cleared it   again.... Why oh why did 2 and 3 have to be for the PSP?  How to ruin an absolute gem of a game.   Anyway. Very original and a lot of fun. Not overly hard but very well constructed. This is a   great example of mashing several genres correctly.     
"If you miss Fire Emblem, Buy This."
The story really goes off the rails but otherwise the game is still quite good.
The most kawaii WWII-inspired game.
"This game is a solid, well built and very addictive mix of real time acion and turn based strategy. It's very fun to play and has more than serviceable graphics. It has simple mechanics, but with more than enough complexity to appeal to any old school strategy wargamer.  The main problem I have with it is the force-fed story. The developers seemed unsure of wether they were making an anime or a videogame so they did both. And crammed a non-sensical storyline that runs on anime-logic and as such, it's completely idiotic. And I mean pants-on-head retardation. More than once I found myself facepalming at the characters' dialogues.   So if you can skip and/or ignore the anime bull crap, you'll find a very solid and enjoyable turn-based squad-managing strategy game."
"♥♥♥♥ rosy so hard, why is she even fighting, why is she not just burrning kindergardners and laughing at them, i have never wannted to punch a charicter so much."
good port of a good game should probably wait for a sale though
"If you like commanding a squad of troops, turn based combat, WWIIish settings and don't mind anime styled visuals this might be the game for you."
"An awesome tactical turn based third-person shooter with decent anime style, this game and its sequels deserve lots of attention soon. Just get it when it's on sale."
"Nice and simple design, quite enjoyable gameplay. The storyline wasn't that strong in my opinion, but the rankings and the achievements kept up an interest in the game."
Valkyria Chronicles A world where Europan continent is in the midst of war. You got chicks and guns on your side. -Accidentally blew up Alicia -Accidentally ran Vayse into 3 shock troopers -Sniped a sniper with a sniper -Missed 4/5 times with the tank 11/10 would fail again.
Great story with fantastic turn based combat.
"My first go at an anime game and I enjoyed it all the way through. The game is challenging and I found myself having to give certain levels multiple goes, because I made a fatal mistake in one turn. The story captures racism, betrayal and the loss of friends. The game takes a lot of inspiration from world war 2, guns and tanks are heavily influenced by it.  VC2 and 3 are psp exclusives still, 3 never even got a US/EU release. Sadly, it seems 4 is going to be a ps4 exclusive."
I love this game.
Very good game play and is a very nice stragey game. It really hurts my head but that makes it a good strategy game since it is actually pretty hard.
"This game is quite different from most I play. It is a port, and I am a PC gamer only. So I haven't really played a game quite like this. Having said that, it is brilliant. The combat is quite challenging and immersive and the story line is very interesting. Knowing what I know now, I would buy this game flat out at full price, but on sale it is a no brainer. You will fall in love with the characters and feel sad when on dies. Try it, and if you like the combat style, you will like the entire game."
You can add underaged lolis to your squad to murder people.   The girls are happy when they kill somebody and do cute poses for that matter.   Has a Beach Filler.   Lancer dude murders everyone 'cause veggies.  Isara dies/10 would buy at full price again.
"At the time I write this review I have only played for a couple of houres, but I doubt any of the things I will write about is going to change later since it will mostly be about the basic gameplay, I won't go too indepth. Rather i'll try to give my thoughts from the perspective of someone who just picked the game up.  As for PRO'S: The story seems rather interesting, there's quite alot of cutscenes so people who are after a story and like a WW1/2 like setting combined with that unique japanese style will definetely be happy here. To elaborate on the story you have a very handy journal that gives additional information on all characters, the world and items, this can be helpful in developing a deeper connection with the setting and learning more about characters that perhaps aren't getting quite alot of screen time.  The customization is fun and simple, but don't mistake simple for boring, there's plenty of options to keep you feeling like you are gaining something and making the crew your own.  Every character on your team has a personal story and a voice, there is no generic NPC's except a couple of guards in the tutorial parts of the game. You can have 20 soldiers drafted to your team at a single time which means this is quite a big deal.  The planning phase of combat is really fun if you like strategic games like X-Com.  Now for some CON'S: My biggest annoyance so far is the combat itself, I had high hopes for it's tactical gameplay but somehow it's just lacking.. For one the game is turn based and encourages tactics, the drawback to that is that enemies will continously shoot at you, now if this was attacks of oppertunity when you are moving that would be alright, but they will literally keep shooting at you until you end your round which means you will want to rush to end your round as quickly as possible after taking your shots. This sort of limits the tactical potential of the game and makes it feel like the game tried too hard to blend in tactics with action and ended up failing at both. Enemies will also try to simply steamroll you alot which takes away from the viability of cover and it often feels like the optimal strategy would be to simply have your soldiers stand around behind a corner, run up and take your shots then run away again, this makes cover and good positioning feel pointless, you'll just want to cheese your way through the game.  That's about it for now. Would I recommend you to get this game? Yes and no, it certainly feels more entertaining then alot of the generic stuff that's out there, if you got nothing else to do it's probably worth picking up, but if you are also looking forward to other things i'd put it off. In the end it depends alot of what you looking for, and so far it definetely seems like the main reason to play this game is for the story, I would not buy it for the gameplay.  EDIT: I ended up dropping this game since the further in I got the more frustrating the gameplay got. The pro's of this game still stands and I wish I could have experienced the full story, but the gameplay was just to annoying and repetative, and im not someone who give up easily.. This might very well be the first game I ever quit half way through. I would not recommend picking it up, but it does have redeeming qualities, just be wary."
Great Game finished it on the ps3 and still bought it again on the pc. Not the greatest port but still holds up. Great turnbased game my only problem with it is the ranking system after every mission. They dont care if you decimated all your enemies they just care how fast you finished your mission. So they rather have you run through a battlefield leaving enemies alone just to capture the flag faster.
"Great game, weapon variety lacking i think, well maybe not lacking but not that interesting or its just me. "
Rubbish I dont know what game everybody else is playing but this is a clunky mess.
10/10 you get to kill russians in this game
Several minutes of terrible C grade anime writing seperating moments of a very limited strategy game. Regret buying due to the positive reviews. Total bore.
A very excellent Action-RPG style game. Makes me wish I had played it when it released on ps3. would reccomend 8/10
"This game is great for those who love story-rich gameplay. The game is beautiful to look at coupled with the beauty of its music. The characters are created to be relatable to and provide immersion with the story. The gameplay mechanics are a little awkwrd at first, but are quite easy to use. The voice acting seems a little stale at times, but is comprehendable. Overall I give it a 9/10"
"This only one of the best turn-based game, even if I paid this game at its full price, I still feel it should have worth more than that. Steam needs more game like this, honestly!!!"
"The lightheartedness of the beginning is a bit decieving. Brilliant story with an interesting twist on mixing familliar history with something original. The combat is challenging and enjoyable. All in all, worthit."
"The gameplay is the main reason to get Valkyria Chronicles, it's really unique. It's turn-based strategy, but whenever you move a unit you actually take control of them in third person. You can move them around, shoot, dodge, it's pretty cool. There's some depth, too, in deciding what enemies to kill outright and what enemies to kill with crossfire on their turn.  The story is fine, it's nothing special, but it's supported by great characters. The main characters are all really compelling, and all the side characters actually are as well. Even the random 'grunt' soldiers that you can put in your squad have names, personalities, histories, and their own voice-acting. You end up not wanting anyone to die because they're all unique.  The aesthetics are very nice. The sketchy, hand-drawn style on top of the 3d models surprisingly looks pretty natural, and the animations are life-like. The music isn't memorable, but it fits the game well. The 'packaging' is great, everything is arranged into different chapters of a history book and the story is told as if you're reading this book.  Now onto the two things I don't like:  The story can drag on a bit. There is a lot of sitting and watching the story play out in front of you in between missions, and it gets boring to just sit there and click.  The missions can be cheesed easily even before reaching New Game+. In some cases it's kind of inevitable (if there's an ambush, naturally the mission is way easier your second attempt since you know about the ambush), but in a lot of the missions you can basically run pass all the enemeis and instantly win. But since you're not forced to do it, it's not a big deal.  Overall, it's a great game, I got it not really knowing what it was and not knowing a lot about strategy games and really enjoyed it."
"worth every cent. it's time consuming, but all worth it in the end."
A Masterpiece 11/10! This game has everything a great game needs: - Great Story - Great Gameplay This is one of the best games ever. The story is very nice and tells a lot of stuff if you get it.
Super-fun game!   Relaxing and pleasant.
"9.5/10  Loved the game spent a lot of time in it. Great story and characters, interesting game mechanics. Have some issues with the dialogue a little bit cringe worthy but still better than alot of other games (Resident Evil, Jill sandwhich)."
guf games if fun for family plaayt with you dog my doge play better then me.
"One of the finest games to ever grace this generation. Artwork is second to none, and even though it's several years old it stands the test of time. Gameplay is addictive, smart, strategic and thoughtful.  A must have for tactical enthusists  "
"A mix of anime, XCOM, and a bit of everything else. Fun times"
"yup, i really like the gameplay"
I reloaded saves more times than my gun in call of duty.
"I have never thought it is such an excellent game!  Story is pretty much a WW2 in a paralell universe where the little nation of Gallia gets invaded by the mighty Eastern Empire. Youre in the skin of Welkin Gunther that has to build up his Squad 7 as a Tank Commander. All kind of volunteers are gonna join your Squad and you have to care, equip, train and fight with them, any with different likes and dislikes, attitudes and skills and reasons to join the Squad. I pretty much like how the story is told in its anime comic style and so the whole actual game is. Gameplay feels like Hogs of War, kinda Worms in 3D if anyone reminds that, selecting units moving them and fire the enemy round by round. Contra: No german subtitles :( Pro: It refreshs my rusty english skills a bit :)  So i very recommend this game to all fans of strategic games and if you have at least a little bit of symphaty for nice storys and animestyle."
"I love this game so much I bought it for 5 bucks after already owning it on PS3. I figured the extra DLC would be nice, but it turns out that it's only a couple of missions. Literally, two. But they're still pretty good fun, and the reward you get for doing Selvaria's missio is well worth buying that DLC.  If you buy this game, and you should, level up scouts and shocktroopers the most. They're by far the best units in the game. Enjoy."
"Good story, good gameplay. 10/10"
"The story has parts that are ok, some even good, especially in the beginning, and others that are just boring and stupid blablabla. The finale was a letdown for me, and i didnt like the end at all. Pretty bad in my opinion. Not only overly unrealistic, but also unnessesary ♥♥♥♥ happens with an important person.  The combat is clunky and unintuitive, and often a chore. I happened to lose hard and long battles just because a Lancer managed to shoot from like 45° side-angle into the back of my tank and oneshot him (2 times). The enemy sometimes just has unfair spawn mechanic. Well, sometimes combat just sucks. You sometimes see you can shoot, but the shot gets blocked by something. I didnt like the cover mechanic at all, feels so unintuitive.  I think the makers of this game thought a great deal about interesting battles and all, but all in all, the combat system is not good, and unfun. I was disappointed by this game."
"I originally played this game on the PS3 and was really thrilled to find it on steam since I no longer have that system. Really detailed cataloguing of charcaters, weaponry, glossery, and historical facts (even a newspaper report after each fight). I enjoy this stragegy/rpg military game. I recommend it to anyone who loves history/military/anime games."
Love it. 10/10
"A good story, nice character, wonderful gameplay!"
"Very unique and fun, I enjoy this game very much. However, there are two things I'm not satisfied: one is the English subtitle dosent match the Japanese voice. Other is they let me start over from overture after I defeated Maximilian. WTF? Ain't that suppose to be optional?  Pkay, so heres my advice: check all the fragment chapter before you fight with Maximilian if you want to. Or else you're gonna start over again."
"I want to start by saying that I don't dislike this game. I wish there was some sort of scoring system as opposed to a yes/no recommendation, because it's not like this is a terrible game, I just simply would not recommend it to most people I know. That said, there's plenty good with the game, but it's also quite flawed. If you take one thing away from this, just remember to  wait for a sale if you want to buy it.  It's definitely not worth the standard price tag, but if you can pick it up for under $10 and this sort of game looks like it's your thing, by all means, have fun. Anyways, on to the review.  I'm gonna start with the negatives and end with the positives, because I just had a particularly irritating play session and more negative critique is on my mind. Granted, I'm not very far into the game, as you can probably tell by my play time, but nonetheless, I think I can offer some valid critique for what we've got here.  Firstly, it's slow. Everything is just way. Too. Slow. Loading is annoying, animations for navigating menus are lengthy, cutscenes seem stilted with how long a gap there can be between characters speaking. Not to mention, in the actual missions, everyone moves really slow, and even there you find annoying animations and the likes in nearly everything you do, artifically increasing the play time. To give you an idea of what I mean, I actually went back and played an earlier mission, timing the amount of time I spent pressing buttons (ergo, playing the game), and compared that with another timer that recorded how much time in the mission was spent during my turns. I kid you not, my turn time was almost  double  of what my 'playing the game' time was. If that doesn't give you an idea of how long all the animations take, just look up some gameplay footage on Youtube and see for yourself.  Second, the story thus far seems very anime. I know that may seem like a bigoted complaint, but if you're not a huge fan of animes, the personalities of many characters will very quickly become grating. The two leads, Welkin and Alicia, are seemingly budding love interests for one another, but their interactions are so cliche that I feel I'll be able to predict the progression of their relationship as I continue through the game. Basically, every overused trope in character development is prevalent in the mains of this game, so if you're looking for a groundbreaking cast, look elsewhere. Not to mention, the plot itself is basically WW2, so if you thought you were avoiding the basic plot of a shooter by playing this game, I must regretfully inform you that is not the case. Who knows, maybe it becomes amazing later on, but for me four chapters in, I'm not interested. 'It gets better later' may be good for some people, but if you're like me, such an excuse is invalid.  Third, the movement controls in combat. Maybe it's better with a gamepad, but with keyboard controls, I never felt like I could put my soldiers right where I wanted them to be. It's hard to describe, but when you let go of a key, your character keeps going in that direction for a second. If you're trying to position your character precisely behind a certain bit of cover, tapping the movement keys to inch your way to an ideal spot never works, as your character seemingly has a minimum amount of movement animation required for each key press. Overall, trying to get soldiers from point A to point B while being shot at usually doesn't go well.  And to add on to the previous point. the tank controls.  Ugh.  It's hard to describe just how bad they are, but if you turn the camera a little left or right while moving straight forward, the tank freaks out and starts spinning in place with no logical way to direct the spinning. I suppose what's going on here is a more realistically controlled tank that has to stop and turn in place to change direction, but it doesn't control that way at all. Like I said, there's no way to tell how the tank will start spinning when you turn the camera. For instance, in one mission i wanted to turn my tank 180 degrees to back out of a corner I had gotten in to, so I thought I'd turn the camera all the way around. The tank didn't start turning, so I decided to move forward in the new direction I was facing, which caused it to rotate about halfway to facing the right direction before switching the direction of its rotation, so it took almost twice as long as it should have for the tank to get where I wanted it.  The movement issues (especially with the tank) may not seem like such a big issue, and yes, they wouldn't be more than a minor annoyance if it weren't for the fact that each soldier only gets a certain amount of movement per activation, so trying to right yourself behind cover repeatedly wastes movement time, which could lead to you expending what little you have left only to leave your soldier standing out in the open. With the tank, turning costs movement, so in the previous example I mentioned where it took way too long to face the right way, I ended up using a decent portion of my tank's precious movement for that activation  without going anywhere.  Perhaps the movement in combat is my biggest issue with the game, and it makes it hard to enjoy sometimes because you end up forming a master plan for how to clear out some enemies while leaving all friendly soldiers in cover, only for that plan to fall apart because of technical issues.  Alright, so that's basically what I think is glaringly wrong with the game. It has maybe a few more minor issues, but honestly, this is what stands out to me. With that in mind, on to what I like about the game.  I'm usually not one to be swayed by graphics or anything like that; I feel that a game should hold up on the merits that it's well designed. But WOW does this game have some great aesthetics. Sure, it's not the most graphically advanced, but the scenery was nice to look at, the music was atmospheric, and the visual design of the characters was distinct and memorable (even if it got a little trope-y at times). If you don't buy the game, get the soundtrack or listen to it online, because it's all got a great feel to it.  Next, I like the diversity offered in character classes and abilities in combat. With such different types of units, each with their own range of mobility and combat prowess against different enemies, coming up with strategies in combat certainly does require some thought and rarely boils down to 'shoot them with the biggest guns.' Sure, the classes are nothing unique in terms of archetypes, but it's clear there's been a lot of thought put into how each of the classes interacts with one another in combat.  Perhaps my next point ties into aesthetics, but I feel that there's a real sense of weight behind the weapons in this game. Shooting the heads of enemy scouts from the top of a sniper tower  feels  powerful, while firing at a tank with a machine gun  feels  pointless. Not much else to say here, just satisfied that the design and feeling of a game can merge pretty seamlessly in such a case.  Though earlier I said that the characters can be annoying, it's also gotta be said that there's something genuine about their design, and much of the general design in this game. It's clear the developers weren't going for something that would easily have widespread appeal, but rather, a game with some true heart behind it. They put a lot of love into their work, and it's visible through how the characters interact. I personally was turned off from it and you may be too, but hey, I can see the value in a story experience like this.  Lastly, the degree of customization outside of combat is  fantastic.  I won't go too much into depth on it (mostly because I'm running out of space to write this review), but if you look up info on it and like strategy games, I'm sure you'll be impressed.   TL;DR:  Good to buy  on sale  if you like strategy games."
"Absolutely wonderful.   The story is excellent and a good length.   Gameplay is an interesting mix of turn based strategy and 3rd person shooter-meets-xcom.   Only minor gripe, the game has some slope-physics issues if your running over 60fps. This can be managed by the frame limiter in the options."
"The art is beautiful, the story is amazingly interesting and the gameplay is phenominal. A must buy for anyone that likes good games."
"First off, this is a strategy game, not a shooter. The combat system is very interesting, the way it mixes tactical and turn based. You have a limited amount of 'captain points', or times you can move a unit or perform certain actions. You use these to move your squad around and shoot, but when you run out of captain points, it's the enemie's turn. They follow the same rules, for the most part. This is a pretty cliffnotes explenation of the combat, at first I was very skeptical and hesitant of this, it just sounded so strange. But when I got into it, I really got into it. The combat flows rather well and while it has the occasional frustrating moment, I was overall very pleased on how it all fell into place. I really couldn't care less about the story or characters, it's fairly cliche'd and uninteresting, though the visuals are very nice. Overall, if you enjoy good tactical/strategy games, you should try this out for an interesting change of pace."
"I'll tentatively recommend this game.... with an asterisk. To summarize it's a game that OUGHT to be 9/10.. but some of the maddening design choices the designers made drops it to maybe a 6.5/10. The visuals are interesting.. the story is good.. the voice acting is... passable. The squad level combat ought to be jagged alliance levels of fun.. but unfortunately the controls are incredibly wonky, and the AI is idiotic. Of course it makes up for this idiocy by being able to snipe-kill your units from across the map, while your guys can only shave off a tenth of the enemies health. What you're essentially reduced to is a lot of save scumming, because there's countless times my tank hits the treads instead of the body of a tank (hitting the treads is virtually useless, since mobility isn't that important) or my tank is humming along down the street only to stop.. spin it's treads, and use up all it's movement. Might as well reload. Another fun thing is when you know the enemy will come down a certain path.. so you set up your units to fire when the enemy moves into range.. only when he does only one unit fires.. the enemy throws a grenade, destroying your cover.. then immediately goes again and kills one of your guys. Reload. Another bizarre thing is they have sniper towers you're obviously supposed to put your snipers in. Problem is.. there's no defense in them. So basically I've put my unit way up high where all the enemies can see and fire at him with no cover whatsoever. So what you're resorting to is going up the tower.. . taking a potshot.. then climbing back down the tower.. ridiculous. I could go on, but there's a million of these little annoying things in the game. And it's too bad.."
"It's hard to say whether or not I recommend this. On one hand, the tactics and mechanics are solid and easy to grasp.  On the other hand, the graphical glitches and some missing functionality make me want to suggest you save your money.  Several character models are broken. They have floating bits constantly at least a few inches from their body, and at least a few feet in the case of one Shocktrooper character. The drill sergeant's eyepatch moves from a few inches in front of his eye to in the middle of his face to aaaaaall the way over there. Hell, the main character has a circular object (I'm not sure what it is, exactly), floating about a foot away from his hand at all times.  In addition, the cursor moves unbearably slowly on map screens, taking far too long to go from one end of the battlefield to the other. Also, the enemy turns are long enough that, if I neglect to press any buttons, my laptop's screen will go dark. There is no in-game option to increase the speed of either of these.  Oh, and the main character's lipsynch at the start of EVERY mission is, uh. Well, it's bad. And I'm not going to say charitable things about the rest of the mouth movements in this game, either.  However, you could charitably argue that these are minor details, and I'm honestly not sure if it's just my laptop doing it.  As for the game's actual presentation, well, I had to sit through ten minutes of cutscene (chopped up into three 'chapters' for some reason) before I got to actually play the game.  And when the game needs to advance story but doesn't feel like putting actual effort into all the cutscenes the game shows you, the characters will be reduced to talking heads.  While I'm not far enough in the story to safely say one way or the other, I've seen enough anime to smell a dating sim on the horizon, and I'm definitely not looking forward to telling the adopted sister character that I'm not interested in dating her when there are reporter ladies to potentially date.  Oh, and the main character seems a little milquetoast. When told his squad is fighting with each other, his first thought is, 'gee, should I really stop these people who are supposed to be acting like a united fighting force from shouting at each other?'  A lot of these are minor flaws, but they add up.   Regardless, the game is still enjoyable despite its flaws, and if you can catch another sale, then pick this game up."
"(One day I shall join the Japanese Amine army, as it seems about half the soldiers are hot young women in a standard uniform of short dress that doesn't quite meet the stockings.)  THE GAME - closest combat is XCOM or similar turn based/action point systems. Works really well, 5 classes plus tanks with various skills/weaknesses. RPG/strategy element is straightforward enough - spend xp and money on upgrades to weapons and skills. The battles are quite long winded and spread out, fine by me but some will want faster. The cutscenes and story are HUGE. The art style is lovely, and I can see they've carefully plotted it all etc, but really I wish there was a 'TLDR' option in game instead.  OVERALL - I got it for under £4 with a voucher, bargain. If you like XCOM combat it's worth up to a tenner I reckon."
"This is by far, The best turn-base strategy game I recall to memory. While in run mode with a soldier any enemy in line of sight and range can and will take shots at you. I had 54 hours in the game at the time of beating play through one Beating the game took me some outside the box thinking. It also has a cut sceen story line throughout the entier game  I highly recommend this game.  The game is not well advertised to sell what it should."
+ Beautiful artstyle and soundtrack + unique strategic combat + great blend of strategy with some rpg elements + good story + very good port  - horrible translation - balancing issues
"I really like turn based games. And I liked Valkyria Chronicles but I can not give a positive review on this one for some reasons. Reason 1- AI the AI in this game is so ridiculous, enemies do the worst possible move, often don`t shoot you, skip turns for no reason, don`t bother going around obstacles, don`t make any surprise moves and never aim at your head Reason 2 - Map Bugs The map is very buggy, have a lot of annoying invisible walls that can prevent you from shooting at a target, fells very limited with just the necessary path for advancing the game, making little room for movement and strategy. Reason 3 - Tank mechanics This is the reason why I could not finish the game, I wanted to but was extremely frustated with the tank mechanics. Basically the Tank gets stuck at invisible objects and every time you try to move or adjust it you burn action points. Sometimes I couldn`t even move 2 metres and my turn was over, The tank just gets stuck at nothing. Also the Freakin tank can`t even go past simple obstacled like stones or sand dunes. It is just really frustating. Overall, the game would be good if were not for these horrible fixable mistakes. And Although I enjoyed the game a bit I can not recommend because is just feels broken. And if you do a turn based game it is better that the AI is damm good otherwise it become lame and unchallenging. Almost broke my mouse out of frustation with the tank...."
"Starts slow, the manga style storytelling is kinda poop..... but there is so much to like about this! I want any sequel ever ported.  Every mission is different, it adds a new element or new approach, instead of spam the same tactics. Characters are great and well-voiced.  I wanted it to be more complex and longer.   pros: unit control is done well, upgrades, done well, graphics: very very likable, no rubber-banding, characters are likeable and whatnot, ballanced rock-paper-scissors-tank thing, Jann exists, he is my favorite lancer. unit weakpoints, the 'potential' system. the 'hand-drawn' filter looks cool. Great design in levels, contantly changing aproach, to an extent.  cons: needs more depth in unit leveling, there are two levels, bleh, and elite.... why not expand on that ish? briefing is crap, you need to figure to play a mission and intend to fail it to get a good grasp of what is going on, once you grasp a mission, you can master it, there is very little change. no real details about what leveling units up does, like.... do I get more ap? do they get more hp? what do they get other than sounds of puking in training?  I was hooked on this game after the 3rd mission. I really want all sequels now."
"A truly beautiful game. The art style perfectly matches the mood of this story, the characters are engaging and memorable, and the relationships draw you in. If games with well written stories and challenging gameplay appeal to you, you should buy this."
"im sorry but i did not like this game,i enjoyed the story but the game play flet hollowe and unfished,i dont like how i can only move a certain number units per trun along side some unite requre a bigger cost to move,the trun time limt is also a trun off for me,i see how someone would enjoy this but i do not"
"The review by [T-A!] Whoota really nails this on the head, and I completely agree. I'm not usually one for games like this but I picked it up because it was on sale and the artstyle really interested me. From the get go I was absolutely captivated and it was pretty much all I did until I'd got through the story, I just couldn't bear to leave it and do something else. I'd have quite happily paid full price or even more for this game, for the quality of the gameplay, music, graphics and everything else involved.   Truly the best game I've played in a long time and something genuinely beautiful in my opinion. I wish I could forget all about it just so I could experience it again."
"TLDR: If you like; either; lighthearted romantic stories; or; tactical tank battles; you will like this game. Probably worth the full price, but I'm glad i got it on sale.   Story 8/10- I struggled a little to overcome my own biases with the story. It's well written for a lighthearted romantic, but I am a slightly twisted cynic. I found the clean lines of good and evil, along with the perky and upbeat 'positive thoughts will win the day!' attitude of the charactes, to be rather childish. But all in all it was still a good story with some depth to it.   Gameplay 9/10- The game plays extremely well for a port of any kind. I have rarely played a port with so few bugs. The tactical portion of the game is very well done, requiring a lot of thinking ahead and planning maneuvers. The battles do sometimes get tedious, especially if your replay the skirmishes to level up, and the squad mechanics are a bit fiddly.  Controls 7/10- I do recommend a controller of some sort, but can be played well enough with just a keyboard and mouse. The steam controller works OK with it, but is really buggy if you try to reconfigure any of the controls. I wish there was an autosave, I crashed a few times (my own tinkering not a game bug) and had to replay several scenes that felt like a real slog.   Soundtrack 7/10- Nothing jarring, but nothing memorable either. Adequately matched to the mood of the game.  Graphics 8/10- This is a pretty game. For a port it is magnificent. The scenery is nice, the characters are smooth, and the artwork feels seamless with the battlegrounds.  Overall 8/10 Recommended"
"This game is possibly the most strategy and planning intensive turn based strategy game ever. IT'S FIRE EMBLEM WITH GUNS! If you like thinking through things rather than running in guns blazing, get this game. IT'S FIRE EMBLEM WITH GUNS! Plus the trading cards are worth a ton (comparatively) and sell fairly quickly. IT'S FIRE EMBLEM WITH GUNS! Great storyline too. IT'S FIRE EMBLEM WITH GUNS!  Just get the game already....."
"I saw the rave reviews for this game and set it on on my wishlist for when it came on sale and happily purchased it for $4.99 and am I glad that I waited for it to be on sale otherwise I would have asked for a refund at full price.   To start off the game is terribly slow, from the conversations to the game play, it's just slow. The game is designed like you are reading a history book and reliving/playing the history. Each chapter there are 1-2 missions with several (4-7) cutscene video peices. So in order to play a mission you have to get through all the story, which is presented slowly and is set in a boring anime style (linear characters, lame relationships, boring conversations, etc). Sometimes you can click through the dialogue to speed it up but most the time it's either suffer through the poor story telling or just skip the video all together. After the first three chapters I just began skipping everything to get to the battles.  Before I get into the battles there are also several other annoying features, want to upgrade your troops/weapons? Not too hard, but you have to suffer through a dialogue from the training person each time. Upgrading your troops is the most annoying, I don't need the drill sargent to comment on every freaking level up, for ever class, every time. Again you find yourself trying to power click through everything. There are also worthless features like getting this reporter to follow you and you pay her to give you good press. I'm sure there is a benefit but I found myself not spending any capital on it because it was painful to get through everything.   For the battles themselves they were good enough to get me to play the 30 odd hours that I did but eventually I found it not enough to get me to power through all the dumb story stuff. I won't go into detail on the battles because several of the positive reviews cover it nicely.   Basically I found the game to be kind of a waste because despite the long game play, there isn't much game being play."
"Ah, I never thought I would be in for a trip that changed my perspective on this game when I played it.  The only thing I wish to bring forth is the voice acting. Sounds kinda cheesy, not much feelings put into it in some parts of dialogue. Even the Japanese version sounds kindof dull...slightly, if ever so.  When I looked at the video trailer for this game, I thought it would be like a TPS, which to my surprise, it is a Turn Based RPG. At first, I kinda feel like I wanna drop this game when I see how the game plays, but later on, I became melded into it. The only thing that I hate is the RNG factor, but that is the basic thing for RPGs , right? As I level up and purchase new upgrades for my Squad, the game felt so better to play as the RNG reticule. The most ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic feeling I've got is when I used a sniper with an A level accuracy. The RNG is so small, that when the sniper gets an Accuracy Boost potential activated, the RNG basically is non-existent. Just. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic. Critical headshots ahoy.  The story is very gripping I say. As the story unfolds more, the more interesting it gets. And, a deathflag will be activated along the story. You'll be destroyed when it gets activated. Speaking of deaths, the soldiers will perma die if they get into a critical situation and if you don't save them in time.  The DLCs are very good. They give you a chance to play as the enemy and to see the other side and drama of them instead. The DLCs also have more challenges which you can complete to earn extra money and experience.  Wish that this game has multiplayer though. Now that'll be awesome. (and tiresome...Imagine 1 hour of playing the game. Owh the horror D: )"
Awesome game! Never liked turn based RPG but this game proved me wrong :D
Played 300+ hours of this on PS3.  About to do it again on PC.  strongfeels/10
"So, I just have finished playing this wonderful game. I decided that it deserves positive review and I am gonna tell you why.  Story: It takes place in the year 1935, where two opposing military factions, the Empire and the Federation, wage war against one another on the continent of Europa. You can say that it is some kind of alternate WWII. So, it starts in a small town called Bruhl that belongs to small country Gallia, where a 19 years old girl on town watch, Alicia, encounters accidently the son of a passed gallian general, whose name is Welken Gunther. The two are cast into the military life, where they fight for their lives and lives of their comrades. The plot of the game is very exciting and reveals through the small scenes as a part of the book. You will find a lot of romance, fun and breathtaking scenes here, nevertheless, sometimes you don't believe that just one squad takes the missions where it is required to send full combat company.  Characters: Almost no problems here. All the characters make up a pretty diverse cast. They are well-developed and almost all main and supportive characters have its own chapter telling about their skeletons in the wardrobe. Nevertheless, rest of the crew stories are limited by small notes in the book, you will find a bit of squad 7 characters development in extras, but it is not enough. If you want to get a little closer to them, you should watch anime.   Music: I will limit myself to one point to which music here is very good. Thats all  Gameplay: Gameplay left a mixed impression and I am gonna tell you why. Battles are quiet challenging and intresting... till the moment you realize that almost any battle can be finished up to 2-3 turns just with scout/*lancer* rushing (except the missions where it is impossible to finish fast due to its specificity *minor spoiler*, like tank *escort*). I can't tell you that I don't like the battle system, but seriously, every f*cking mission where you have to reach point/capture a camp/kill the boss requires just 2(3) things: scout, def order (later +*caution order*). After chapter 9 I've done every mission and got A class for each without problems. Sometimes, you must use lancers. Thus, snipers, shocktroopers and engineers don't deserve a single point of your precious exp point at all (after chapter 9-10 definitly). I understand that it kills fun in the game, but if it allows to use this, why not? From time to time, game tries to convince you that it can't be done this way, although, there is always fast approach to finish the mission, you just have to think a little and I want to tell you that during this thinking and searching, entertaining will come. I can confidently say that despite the uniformity of missions purposes, landscape is different and you always solve a maze as a consequence when you reach the goal it gives satisfaction.  Pumping weapons, tanks and fighters is a good part of the game, I like it. When your fighter grow stronger they get new personal qualities with HP increasing, almost all of them are very useful (especially lancer's and scout's ones)  Summary: I recommend you this game if you like anime style, SRPG, military themes and good stories. The battle system could have been better, but it is entertaining enough I believe.  P.S. sorry for grammar"
I like this game for the combat tactic elements and the artstyle. The game is fun to play for long times and the story is fairly interesting aswell. I would recommend this game for people who like strategic games.
"A great narrative with a unique gameplay system. I can't really describe the journey well enough but it was definitely an inspiring game, and I learned something from the experience. Only issue is the tank controls and the lack of a button to restart the battle easily."
"Pros: +Beautiful graphics style +Good story +Interesting characters +Permadeath for squad members makes decisions mean more +The hybrid of turn-based and real-time gameplay is seamless and easy to learn  Cons: -There are a LOT of cinematics and cutscenes. I personally liked the story and setup, but some could find it boring -While overall an extremely well-made port, there are a few things in menus that take some getting used to -The controls for the tank (with kbm) are the worst freaking controls ever made for any game, period.. You can end up turning in the completely wrong direction or wasting an entire movement bar to do nothing. -You can only crouch/lay down when next to terrain that lets you, so when you are in the open, you are completely in the open  This game not only looks great and has a good story, it delivers in the gameplay area as well. Each each squad member has several different weapons/abilities, protecting commanders and flanking the enemy are key to success. The whole game plays out like an anime, which I guess could be a pro or con depending on what you are looking for."
"It's... not that good.  It has potential and I really like the format of the battles. It becomes a bit like a game of chess and reminds me of frozen synapse if you've ever played that game. However there are two major faults that I have a hard time looking past:  - The story and how it's presented is awful. - The battles can be frustrating due to weird 'rules' or limitations in the level design and character movement.  The story is just stupid, it's like a pre-teen version of war with bright sunny colors and a happy-go-lucky attitude. Half of the cutscenes you watch (and there are what seem like hundreds of them) are completely useless in that they don't advance the story or characters at all. Very boring.  The battles are clunky. The level design is very contrived, and there are a number of hidden 'rules' that you won't know about until you hit their limitations during a fight. Particularly when it comes to where the tank can move, it feels very constrained.  I feel like the format of the battles is pretty cool, and if the game improved upon them and distilled some of the story down to its best elements it would be a great game. As is, I would pass on it."
"Just as good on PC as it was on the PS3 and I now get to enjoy the game all over again. Great story, characters and gameplay all in one artistic package for any turn-based strategy fan.  Would definitely suggest it to anyone."
"if you like games like fire emblem and xcom you'll like this, it adds it's own refreshing mechanics to the genre and does the already existing ones well, it has a fair amount of content so you won't need to worry about not getting your bang for your buck."
This game is one memorable game I've played
"Alright, This game was.... How should I put it? 'Aniti-war clich'e? ' It was a very good and innovative game which port from previous gen ps3 console, First I've heard it was exclusive title and meant to be be there. But now, Its finally here on PC and I'm finally delve myself into the curiosity which I've left for 9 years ago. And this is my Pro/Con  Pro + Beautiful graphic, From what I've gathered. This is a house brew engine specify for this game. All cell shade wasn't just a modified effect of exist code but a really cel-shade built in. + Innovative turn-based gameplay, Its a big modification of what I use to know in X-com or most of those turn base out there. + Interesting characters. +An interesting plot, A bit too soft core though. considered this is a game about war and destruction. There was quite a number of heart-felt scene meant to make you feel sad (In my case though, It was a bit too clich'e and lack of certain 'violence element' made these scene a bit force) + Variety upgrade, not to the point of full customizable. But it is still surprisingly deep for a game this old + Decent voice acting and music score (I love 'Desperate fight' very much)  Con - Un-customize graphic option... Really?  - The control with mouse and keyboard was... kinda nice. But could be a bit more better. No? - Strange tank control scheme.   Its an interesting game, If you were a person whom interesting in Turnbase genre. And looking for something quite different (You know, Instead of saw those grimmed face grunt going turn to turn. Now you get to do that with cute looking squadmate instead etc.)   Ps. One more thing, This game .... the way I see it was more like 'anti-war'. There will be no moment you could laugh at giblet enemy or shout 'Boom headshot!!' or anything like that. Stll, if you looking for an innovative kind of turn base, This will be a new tasted for you, You war monger."
"Excellent game and continue playing it. Never played it before but it is wonderfully done.  The Graphic Art design reminds me similiar to the The War of the Lions (Final Fantasy Tactics) for PSP.  At present I cannot find any faults but will give an update once completing this game.  --- Oct 2016 - Finished the Game, Side Quests and Bonus Games Story = very well done, rich and moving. The in game and storyline graphics are supberbly done, with the background music making it perfect.  Slow to start off and level up. But once you do, it is great. I spent more time in the skirmishing though.  If the second and the third game to PC, I would buy it. Shame it is only for PSP at the moment"
"Overall, absolutley fantastic, can't even remember a single part that I didn't enjoy. If you're reading this, buy it. No excuses. 20$ is a steal."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a really charming and fun game. The story is a little hackneyed, but the cast of characters and tactical gameplay more than make up for it. I definitely recommend this game."
"The difference between the Ps3 and PC versions is quite clear in the graphics and run speed, and the achievements are quite easy to get if you have played the console version.  Ever since I bought this game when it first came out for Ps3 I wanted to hear the japanese voice acting, but I noticed that there are quite a few translation errors in the text displayed, which is quite funny sometimes."
Its Really Good Very Unique
Great turnbased strategy game
"This game is just fun, challenging at times but that is one of the things that makes it fun if you ask me. Besides this game had a nice storyline, it's emotional at times, you can feel triumphant or saddened at either a loss or a victory. When you lose it isn't over, you may learn something. A warning to new players or someone looking for a reason to buy this game, letting someone die might seem like a good idea at the time, but in this game if you lose a comrade that isn't part of the storyline, you don't get them back, you lose them. However don't let that keep you from getting the game, you never know besides it's even more challenging and emotional with that aspect. Though you may WANT to lose a comrade, I think a motivation for that would be the personality of the character, because they all have their own personality. Though I still don't like losing someone. Now the gameplay, it isn't a normal turn-based-strategy-game if you ask me you get to play out the character's actions, well thats really all I have to say on gameplay, besides that its AMAZING. Well I guess all thats left is, Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Give Up, oh and I'd give this game a 9/10. Good day to you, and have a nice day or evening depending on when your reading this."
"I murdered 100+ tanks with Jann, the tank killing machine. 11/10 would murder tank again.   EDIT: Nominated for steam awards!"
Could we have more of the series please?
"An amazing story, coupled with great gameplay and a strong strategic squad tactics systems. Be warned, some of the cutscenes are extremely lenghty.  I personally am a huge anime fan, and I enjoyed the story in the game (despite some cheesy and predictable plot points). This story is absolutely a stand-alone, but if your a fan of epics like Howl's Moving Castle, or the Light of Eilian, I would heavily recommend buying the game and then watching some of the OVA's that were released that follow some of the pre-history of this world.  Easily a strong recommendation, and very much worth a buy."
You know a title is truly unique when the google results for ”games like Valkyria Chronicles” do not give you anything even close to it. And this is a gem when you know the latest game in the IP is not a turn based strategy anymore.
"Valkyria Chronicles is a great game that was overlooked when it originally released on PS3, but has since found an audience with it's re-releases and ports. The art style does an excellent job of making 3D objects appear 2D when they aren't moving, which is perfect for the history book aesthetic the game employs."
"A compelling storyline without constraining the gameplay. There is always another way to reach your objective - you just need to find it. Resource managment, strategy and tactics - all together with a story which makes you identify even with the villains."
One of the best story driven stratergy Games I have ever played and is the fist in the series before they decided to put them on the PSP for some reason.
"One of the best anime games on steam, have an army of lolis defend you. 9/10"
This is a very stylish game. Its use of free roam during battles brings a unique experience to the players. The storyline uses an amazing plot from anyone into anime to military shooter. I recommend watching the show to gain a sense of what to expect when first lauching into the game or vise versa.
I told my friend to buy it  he did and got to chapter 3 and never played it again 
"Fantastic game. Great strategy, genuine challenge, and a story and characters that got me emotionally invested. If you like Fire Emblem, you'll probably like Valkyria Chronicles.  Do yourself a favour and play this."
Good game. Great plot
"An absolutely great game........ that I'll never finish. A single cutscene took all the fun from the game for me and turned my love to loathing. Some things I just can't forgive, turns out I can't handle the true consequences of war. What was a dealbreaker for me though shouldn't scare others away from a very fun game with a great storyline. Give it a try."
this game is amazing originally came out onn the ps3. extremly fun unique game
"Definitely one of the more unique kind of games out there. Mixing strategy and turn based combat, Valkyria Chronicles stands as one of the great Ps3 games of its time and is still a fun pickup to this day."
Best anime game on steam!
Just...Epic
What i can say about this game its very beatiful and cool.
"Heartwarming story that portrays World War 1 in an alternate world. It has its Japanese game tropes, but the message still comes through and will definitely elicit some sort of emotion out of you."
no words just love this game
"Great game, great port, awful subs."
"Part visual novel, part rts, part rpg, and anime. OMG I love this game, it literally has everything I love. While looking simple the combat can get challenging, and the story it fleshed out far better than most games. It is also quite long for this type of game, very well worth the price, If you love anime, you will love this. One of the best games Steam has to offer."
"Turn based strategy game. If you like X - Com series and aniem then this is for you. Great port, this is the way games shall be ported."
Amazing game even though i'm quite butthurt from mission 7
This game... Hhhhhhh this game is a good game.
"If you like anime, and alternate World War senarios, this game is perfect for you"
At one point in this game... it made me fell manly tears
"One of the best jrpgs that is on steam. It has great characters, a great story, and a fun combat system. Everyone should play this game."
"Amazing sotry, Great gameplay"
Great story 
"I always wanted to play valkyria chronicle. But alas, I didn't owned a Ps3.  Then, when I was lossinf=g hope, they released it on steam.  I'm having a ton of fun"
If you like it when your waifu gets shot and dies this game is for you
THATS ♥♥♥♥ IS GOOD  PRO  -LANCE ROCKET LUNCHER -BIG ♥♥♥ TANK -♥♥♥♥ LOAD OF CHARACTER (WHO EACH HAVE A UNIQUE STORY CONTAIN IN THE DIARY) -♥♥♥♥ LOAD OF UPGRADE FOR THE GUN AND THE TANK -CUSTOMIZATION FOR THE TANK (not for ther color but YOU CAN CHANGE THE TURRET FOR THE SECOND TANK AND REPLACE IT WITH A MACHINE GUN OR A DAMN FLAMETHROWER) -THE GAME PLAY IS GODAMN FUN -DID I SAY BIG ♥♥♥ ENNEMY TANK? WELL THERE IS BIG ♥♥♥ ENEMY TANK -YOU NEED TO USE YOUR BRAIN TO MAKE A GOOD TEAM   CON - The light heart story don't really match the story but its minor in my opinion - the next game are psp exclusive so you cannot have more of the fabulous game unless you have a psp or an emulator -the control for the tank are a little crappy but with a little practice this issue can be overcome  9/10 THIS GAME IS WORTH YOUR MONEY
"Valkyria Chronicles is the kind of game that spreads by word of mouth. It had barely any promotion and its anime aesthetic turned off some gamers. Still it has the kind of charm that grows on you. The main character is gormless like so many anime protagonists but his colourful subordinates make up for it. In that respect it is a slightly less sociopathic Jagged Alliance. Among the disparate personalities of Squad 7, you will soon find some that become favourites. Some others... not so much.  The colour palette and art direction are outright beautiful, like a water colour painting come to life. The gameplay is deep enough to be interesting and fun without being overwhelming. The story is decent albeit cliched in some points. Overall it is personality that sells this game and I curse the fact that the rest of the series is unlikely to ever come to Steam."
"Have you always wished to be able to play the anime you've watched? Are you a fan of engines tied to fps? Do you love ''turn based combat''? Do you love diving through endless useless menus?  Look no further, Valkyria Chronicles is the perfect game for you. Long unskippable cutscenes that pretty much make up a whole anime series, turn based combat that hates you unless you scout abuse, engine tied to fps which makes it impossible to drive up hills with your tank at 60fps or higher and a bunch of menus that will make you hate yourself.  Would I reccomend this game to others? Hell yes! It's a fantastic game."
"If Anime and World War II had a baby, it would be this game."
"Masterpiece, Fantastic, Classic, what else can I say; Play it!"
"If you're looking for a SRPG with FPS aspects, this is the game for you"
"A semi-light tactical rpg puzzle game. Plot is OK, but suffers from female role assumptions or something like that, anyway pointless angst about power.  Gameplay is fun, characters are fun enough."
"I heard many good thing about this game when it released on PS3 years ago. When I play it, I just feel this game is played better on PC than on PS3. Well, I think manual aim using mouse is much better than using gamepad and so far, manual aim is very crucial for this game... And more, SEGA also made this port support better framerate than PS3 version.  It's not a perfect port. There is some annoyance like no mouse navigation on the menu. You must using keyboard all the time for the menu navigation. But, apart from that, it's still a great game. One of the best and innovative tactical RPG even on today standard.  I just hope SEGA port the 2nd and 3rd installment to PC. And then continue this series one way or another and of course, put that on PC too if they'll do that..."
"Sega, sequels on steam please. Will pre-order immediately"
"10/10, now port the sequels."
it is one of the best rpg i ever played   pro:- work great in my old win 7 / 8 / 10 great story made me happy angry energetic and motivated and my eye waters great sound trucks  great strategic play system turn base but with auto alias support system  con:-  nothing to wright  that what i think it is up to you to decide.
"I find myself wanting to play this game over and over again. Even when it's very linear, it has a lot of replay value. I just hope the other two games in the saga are brought to Steam as well. Also, the story is fantastic, if you haven't played it, don't hesitate, go for it."
"Fantastic combat system, engaging story and quite good visuals. Ad an excellent port for instant success. One of the best games I've ever played through 10 times..."
"Really, REALLY dig the visual style. I wish more games would use it. Also, the PC-port is fantastic, something that just doesn't happen for Japanese games."
"Deep storyline and fun gameplay. Some levels feel a bit long, but it is a very challenging game that is welcome when most tend to be a bit too easy."
Hands down one of the best anime style game.
"Go play this game, its good"
A fantastic and emotional game with some of my favourite moments in gaming and a fantastic strategic combat system. Characters become less like common stereotypes over time and the story has a satisfying conclusion... and Faldio is awesome (^^).
"Highly playable 8/10  A beautifully illustrated game with a decent storyline built around turn based squad combat scenarios and with optional skirmishes to help level up the unit. Individual squad member characters with interactiosn that affect their abilities and some cool gear to be gained.  The only thing that bugs me is the clunky menu interface which was designed for console gameplay. I'd really like to see more games done with this kind of artwork though, so much more character to it, and so much better to look at. Absolutely love it, I hope it gets a sequel :-)"
- Great story  - Unique gameplay  - Cheap af  End.. 
"You have you own personal tank that you use to fight wars, deliver babys, shade on the beach and as a submarine.  simple but great story plus there is a pig called Hans  plus its still looks better than the PS4 version   "
"An utter masterpiece, deserving of a cacophony of laurels, medals, statues and lingerie designs."
"There are no words to describe my love towards this game. I mean, it's everything I could ever love about a game. Art made by Honjou Raita, the master of masters. Tactical RPG mixed with RTS. World War II inspired. Enjoyable characters, amazing plot, memorable moments, etc. This game is one of a kind, and I own it in every single platform possible. SO BUY IT, AND SEGA WILL BRING VC III TO THE WEST. PLEASE; I NEED IT."
Super fun strategy game with an excellent story and gameplay.
"with games like this, I refuse to save scum, so STOP KILLING MY ♥♥♥♥ING SOLDIERS JESUS CHRIST ;c"
"Good turn based gameplay, likeable characters, good ost, nice story, weapons, tanks, Selvaria and Alicia.  What else can you ask for?  10/10 already beaten on PS3."
"Not that hard to be honest, yet still very enjoyable and a bit short. (35h~) I would say ti is worth it if you are considering it."
"Valkyria Chronicles was one of my favorite games from the PS3 console generation. That it was ported to PC was both surprising and thrilling, and I was more than willing to fork over the money for a Steam copy to make it easier to play now and in the future.  Most everything about this game's design is great, from the visuals, the real-time/turn-based hybrid battle system, the cast of characters, to even the game's 'storybook' main menu/user interface. The units and maps are varied enough to stay interesting, and earning the highest rank on mission's (and extra missions) prove appropriately challenging. The soundtrack was also very nice. The 'orders' system adds complexity and depth by allowing you to grant stat bonuses to specific troops or your entire unit.  Despite not having a big marketing presence behind this game, it has turned out to be widely recognized and beloved, relatively speaking for the niche title it is. While there are other games in the series, it hasn't had any other entries on a home console or PC since the original. I hope the success of Steam sales prompts further VC titles. It's a nice, eclectic blend that works well.  This port does have some problems. There is the occasional graphical... hinkiness, and in a couple spots I would consistently fall through the map. Obviously they were not bad enough to keep me from enjoying the game, but this isn't QUITE as excellent as the PS3 original because of this. It's my definite pick for game that stood the test of time in 2016!"
"Thank you Sega, thank you! I never expected to play this wonderful game in 1080p at 60 FPS!  To anyone who hasn't purchased/played the game yet, watch the anime first! You can view it on Sony's Crackle and of course Youtube. It's amazingly good and incorporates the game's plot nicely (quite an accomplishment considering video game movies/cartoons). You'll bond with the characters and get excited when you realize there's an awesome game waiting for you with these guys in it.  Five out of Five stars! :D  A must for fans of Japan made games!"
"This game is basically Fire Emblem except in a WWII setting which is amazing. The cutscenes add depth to otherwise generic anime characters, and brings you into the game. The Gameplay is challenging which is good considering that it is a strategy game and you feel more acomplished when you finish a hard mission. The only cons I can see for this game is that the menus still have remnants of a ps3 user interface which can be annoying to navigate but it is a very nitpicky con."
This game is a risky choice. If you buy this game all the other games you play will seem totally bad and uncomparable.
After beating the game I can finally say the game is worth the money.  You will probably need around 40+ hours to finish it. Its a tactical turn/action based strategy game with some premises of rpg.  Highly recommended!
"I have yet to play through the game in its entirety but for what I've seen I'd give it a solid 8 out of 10. It has a bit of an xcom feeling to it which can only be a good thing as xcom was fantastic. Most of the game is spent in a turn-based, 3rd person, cover based shooter, which is an interesting game mechanic that I really haven't seen much anywhere else. This gives you the feeling of having a little bit more control over the characters as you select them in the overworld and then go into third person to move them and perform actions such as engaging the enemy. The artwork for the game is beautiful, as it is styled to look like a painting (a rare trait in the genre of strategy games) The voice acting is also very well done, not much else to say about it. I do have a few complaints though, the first being the movement mechanics while in third person. Most of the time, your foot soldiers will respond in the fashion that you order them too, however, every now and then they give you trouble, especially when moving around cover. This small flaw becomes much more prevalent when controlling your tank. The tanks controls are inconsistent in their responsiveness and one would think that since it is a tank terrain wouldn't make too much of a difference. This is not the case. Certain areas will make controlling the tank very difficult and changing directions, even while staying in the same spot, will use up precious movement power. I also wish that all the cut scenes were all together, rather than unnecessarily segmented in an attempt to make the game feel like a book.  Now, for all that complaining, should you get this game? If you like turn based strategy games like xcom, yes. The game is a lot of fun and the flaws are easy enough to overlook, especially for the price tag. If you are new to the genre and aren’t sure I would highly recommend playing other similar games first and if you find yourself enjoying them, then play this one."
I would certainly recommend this game for anyone a fan of Strategy games or JRPG's.  Fire Emblem fans would definitely not be disappointed here. The game has a wonderful story and missions and combat which can be approached in a variety of ways.  10/10
"Unique graphics style makes for a pleasant comic book styled strategy game. the learning curve is smooth and is a blast to see the battles steadily get trickier through the campaign. the controls for steering the tank are shifty though as you can steer it by keyboard like your soldiers, or by mouse. This means if you aim to the right, be ready to spend your Action Points trying to straighten back out. 9/10"
best game i have played wish 2 and 3 would be on pc 
"Love this game. Played it on the PS3 for a while and was happy to see it on Steam. Now I'll play it to completion. The art style is one of the best I've seen in any video game and the story is fantastic. You won't be disappointed with this buy,"
Fun Strategy elements and a great story! If you like games like X-com and other turn based strategy games you will definatly like this game too! There is even an anime from it if you prefer to get the story before playing the game.
"Perfect story, Great artstyle, 10/10 voice acting, and a great mix of real time action and strategy."
Kantai Collection ? even better! :D
"Cool, but very hard. Can be played like a 8bits console game."
Quite possibly the best JRPG I have ever played (which includes several Final Fantasy titles). Although some of the characters touch on anime tropes I am less than fond of. The story is excellent but the turn based combat is what really shines. It really doesn't get any better than this. The system this game uses is better than XCom Enemy Unknown and ultimately showcases what I hope to see from the currently in development game 'Mordheim: City of the Damned' albeit in a different setting.  A must-play if you are a fan of turn based tactical RPGs.
"having playing the game for a bit i can now right a review for this game. i bought this game when it was on sell. how ever i do recomend buying when you do get a chance, on sell or not. to explain it is like playing fire emblame (from what i know of the game) how ever i like to compare the game to advance war on the ds. the way the game play is you controll a team of people to take out or capture bases (from what i have played for the time being) unlike other rts i have play when you pick a unit to move and attack , you actually get to move them where you like in a 3d enviroment, even more you can aim where you want to (so if you want to get a crit on a enemy you can) from what the game has told me if an allie dies then they stay dead. however if the fall in battle you have 3 turns to pick them up before there are permently gone from the game. you all so have to watch out for where they are because if an enemy touches them then they are dead even if the 3 turn are not up. i am sorry i can not come up with any cons but i can come up with a lot of pros. they are  -able to play a 3d rts -good war story showing a diffrent europe -intresting battle and lots of ways to go about it -ai can be smart (misson i was play i had a sniper set up hi to take out enemys, enemy tank took aim to take out sniper did not kill the sniper but did destroy the tower the sniper was on) - to go with the first one cover can be destroyed and building like the tower i talk about can be taking down so they can not be use. -good stroy to go with the gameplay ( from what i can tell that i played)  cons.... can not come up with any :D sorry   i will say this if you love rts, 3rd person shooters, and a good story then you will love this game.  to SEGA GREAT JOB ON MAKING THIS RTS 10 out of 10 :D"
I love it! VC2 when?!
One of the best PC ports i've seen in a while
"This game is awesome!! nothing to review,should play it"
"An incredible game, both story wise and gameplay wise. A Fire Emblem-like combat style with a story that just grabs you and pulls you along, both in terms of the actual story and events, and emotionally. At this point I've played for around 41 hours, and still haven't finished! If you're worried about not getting your money's worth, look no further.  If you like Fire Emblem, or other JRPG's, this is for you. If not, then play it anyway!"
"Classifying this game is a bit tricky. It is turn-based, yet acton happens in real-time, yet is mostly limited by a limit of how far characters can move as well as performing one action per activation. Also mixes in PRG elements such as class leveling and equipment management (though not as micro-managed as most). The story is a simplified almost Word War 2 as seen by anime. Charming characters, with interesting, albeit corny storylines. It deal with issues of racism and prejudice, with Darcsens in the plot in a sort of stand-in for Jews (or other minority), though it does not overly villify those with prejudices. The graphics are cell-shaded and very well done, and the controls are mostly smooth. One issue I had was when mouse controling tanks, as the game will sometimes interpret slight movements as a reason to wildly swing left or right, and seeing as tanks consume movement to turn....it can lead to problems. A must have for anime fans. "
"I LOVE THIS GAME!  Well, that came out of no where but it is true.  It is a turn-based game but not in a traditional sense. Most turn-based games have a specified number of action points for each unit to spend. What's unique about this game is that, instead of only turns, it is broken down into phases with a pool of action points. You can then use those action points on any units of your choosing where vehicles consume 2 AP and infantry consumes 1. Each turn a unit can move with diminishing returns (1st 100%, 2nd about 75%, 3rd about 40%, 4th and on about 10%) and fire with no limitations beyond ammo (e.g. grenades, mortars, first aid). With this phase and turn system, a single infantry unit could move (and shoot) up to 20 times but after the third time, they're pretty much stuck where they are. A single vehicle could move (and shoot) up to 10 times. Your rank for each mission is determined by how many phases have passed to complete the objectives. Some seemingly difficulty missions can actually be accomplished in one or two turns having the right units and using them the right way.  I LOVE THIS GAME!  Another thing of note is how the aiming system works. Unlike most turn based games where shooting at enemies is a roll of a dice, this game actually takes into consideration where you are pointing at on the target. That is to say, it has hit boxes like a shooter game where the head counts for a whole lot more damage than the body and you have to aim at the head yourself to order your unit to fire there. It's refreshing having a full 3D game that is shooter-esque but removes the lightning-fast relfexes most shooter games require.  I LOVE THIS GAME!  In the 30+ hours the save claims (excludes reloading and I did a lot of that), I only recall one minor bug: Welkin has massive damage and minimal damage voice overs backwards. I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes action, strategy, and/or turn-based games. It has excellent value and I still want to keep playing it after I beat it. I really hope they take the second and third games that were released on PSP and port it to the same engine this game uses.   Edit: Since writing this review, I beat the entire game again and got A rank in everything. I really like the work they put into the Hard and Expert skirmishes. Expert is almost like a puzzle where you have to position your best units correctly and think very carefully about where your units need to be, when. At no point did this game feel grindy to me. I reiterate:  I LOVE THIS GAME!  Edit: One technical note: 8:5 resolutions are letterboxed to 16:9. Kind of disappointing but doesn't really matter to me other than the BOINC tray icon kept popping through the black."
Love the game
"This game, for me anyway, is hard to write a review for. I haven't completed the game yet, and I'm not entirely sure if I will yet. In this game, you command a militia squad to complete certain tasks on the battlefield, such as occupying an enemy camp, taking down a massive tank, while defending your troops and base camps.  It's a hardcore strategy game. Like, REALLY hardcore. You get to choose every troop that goes into battle, and each troop has their own class, abilities, potentials, likes and dislikes, etc. AT the beginning, you start in a command view in which you see where every ally troop is, and the enemy troops that your troops can see. When you select a troop to move, they can only move a certain distance, and can only fire 1 volley per turn. That's generally how the gameplay works, and if I tried to explain everything, this review would be 20 pages long.  It's a lot to take in, and it's suprisingly easy to learn. Mastering these mechanics, however, takes skill, and you have to plan from who to send it to who to shoot and where to shoot him. Shooting doesn't actually take any aiming skill, as the enemies stay still during your turn and the bullets spread to a certain and uncontrollable degree.  Now for the things that I don't like about this game. I don't like that the bullets spread so much. It's extremely irritating when everything rides on one of your snipers killing this one enemy and he misses due solely to chance. Also, some levels are extremely difficult, which sort of bugs me.  Do I recommend this game? Yes, but only to people who really enjoy strategy. The story so far is pretty good, also. If you enjoy spending an hour or two planning a grand strategy of insane proportions, planning every meticulous detail; and all of that for one level, this is the game for you."
"This game has a wonderful look and a interesting, if bland setting. It is fun when the game is going your way but the combat system has serious problems. If you are expecting a more traditional turn based tactical game like xcom then the combat is going to cause a great deal of frustration. Some characters seem manditory to get the most points per turn, and the map is practicly useless for any kind of planning. It would also be wise to remember there is an anime connected to this game, so wile the main hero is actually competent, the typical story logic and plot convenience will rear its head at times. Overall this game is well polished and there are a few cameos of note, so if you can get past the plot and combat system it may be worth your time."
"If you enjoy JRPG's and strategy games, this games belongs in your library. I originally played this game years ago on the PS3 and fell in love with it. So much so, that I repurchased it through Steam. The music and art work is incredible. Character development and story are great. In addition, this is one of the most emotional games I've ever played."
My favorite PS3 game now on PC.
"It says I've only played a half hour at the time of this writing, but I also had it on PS3. I just want to say that this is the best game EVER MADE. XCom EU/W is good too but it doesn't have the depth, storytelling, good art and low system requirements of VC. This game is excellent on every possible level."
"Extremely addictive and fun game, 5 Stars :)"
"First off, GREAT GAME.  i LOVE the chracters (who do have CHEESY dialogue sometimes, but im sure it was to keep that T rating)  the missions are sometimes Challenging and sometimes downright Evil. i mean the game is extremely unrealistic as far as combat goes. and sometimes it feels little unfair. but that being said it is challenging., which is a reward of its own, it forces you to be vary careful and actually pay attention to WHO you deploy for a mission as each character has strengths and flaws, which will hinder you in combat or get you that live saving extra ammo, or combat buff. i had played it on PS3 then bought it on PC and finally finihsed it, i feel like the PS3 version might have had a little of a handicap since the controls are pretty unforgiving sometimes (dont forget to position your infantry JUST right, because if they are not facing the right way they will get F---ED)  Very human war story. Great artwork. Solid Gameplay. Good Reaplay value.  id say 8/10"
Great game at a great value. Comes with all DLC
Played the crap out of this game on PS3. The PC version is just as good.
"Rosie is a racist pig, but she is still best girl."
"My overall rating for Valkyria Chronicles(TM): 92/100  I can clearly say, that though I was hesitating in the beginning, I was very nicely surprised in the end. Finally, a game from Japan, that has excellent story, suitable gameplay and mechanics, covers serious war issues and gives a space for relax, even war takes a break. Sometimes. I must also admit, there were some issues, but not a big deal, they will be mentioned in the text.  GAMEPLAY  + Visual novel style + Real-time battles with strategic overview (BliTZ system = Battle Live Tactical Zones) + Good controls + Tough, but reasonable challenges and achievements + Replayability o Slower battles during inproper graphic settings o Orders - Overpowered scout class  This title tells you a story in fact. About big war caught up in the novel wrote by Irene Koller, famous Gallian writer. This suggests, that main content is set as a visual novel, where you watch and play episodes and go through the story. Yet, there are some passages you have to play as battles. The BLiTZ system allows you tu use both strategy and tactics to prepare an action, where you control that soldier and you can feel the adrenaline.  Graphic conversion is still difficult in game like these, but it is well managed here. After you will set a correct settings, game runs smoothly. Only cons here are some orders, which can be overpowered, and some of them lack potential (e. g. Caution for 2 CPs vs Artillery Support for 6 CPs). Also Scout class is overpowered, mainly due orders and DLC guns, which can take out many units crouched and only heavy tanks can resist for two actions (without proper order). But you can choose not to go this way and enjoy the possibilities.  VISUALS  + Formidable graphics + Emotions without real-time effect + Nice animation o Weak anti-aliasing - Graphics compatibility  I am glad, that the conversion to PC was made. Even it has some issues, like anti-aliassing missing in some scenes and you have to have very specific settings, it is a marvelous piece. Art style is decent, it reminds me many graphic novels, with coloured pencil drawings. Animation is also pretty well managed and it all gives us a unique visual experience.  CHARACTERS  + Believable characters + Rich story for main ones + Interesting supporting cast + Gender freedom (e g. Jann, awesome gay lancer, who looks pretty cool!) o Beach scene - Flying pig and some typical Japanese features  There are six main characters, who are continuing through the whole story, others take supporting role, but that does not mean, they are less valuable. You have an insight to each one of them, by this all of them are becoming closer to the player.  Beach scene has it pros and cons, I take it that even in war there is always some time to relax, but bikini was for me one of that anime and manga clichés. But, there was nice story with Largo and captain Eleanor Varrot. However, flying pig as a member of squad? Ok, I know, it is militia, it is good, that they did not choose the army, because diversity in characters (twelve year old Shocktrooper vs sixty-five aged one), but that was definitely too much for me.  SOUNDTRACK  + Brilliant music + Corresponding with scenes and ideas  With Hitoshi Sakimoto as composer, this game hits the top in music. There is nothing to complain about, just pure awesomeness. Most favourite - Main Theme, Beautiful Gallia, A Difficult Battle. Enjoy!   SUMMARY  It was stigmatized with JPRG mark, but it overcome the prejudices and became one of most successful games for many players. It combines well various genres, with excellent presentation, what makes this game so unique. For each player interested in JPRG, strategies and rpg in overall, this is definitely a game worth trying. Also visual novel fans will find this satisfying.  I can proudly give this title a strong recommendation and definitely add it to games I like to return to.  "
"I love this so far, its like a mix of Fire Emblem and XCOM, I've been dicking around for the first few hours, busting through the story, and I've gotta say I reccomend this to anyone looking for a fun, story rich game, albeit sometimes the game is a bit slow due to the fact that you can't skip enemy turns, or if you can I certainly havent found a way, but other than that its fun as hell."
"Valkyria Chronicles was really fun. Its like fire emblem. The story was good but cringey sometimes, and the gameplay was fun. For 15 dollars it gave me 35-50 hours of fun on my first playthrough, and It has quite a bit of replay value as well."
"Definitely recommend if you are into anime or manga, especially if you are into the newer anime and manga version of this story. A great expereince away from the later canon storylines from the same title.  Do take note the gameplay for this is not TPS, but rather RTS/RTT. Also might want to look up hints and tips so you don't miss special weapon drops, and forced to redo the missions."
"I bought this game as a secondary (discounted and slight interest) purchase. Played it far more (80 hrs vs 3 hrs) than the other game I bought.  The game allows for almost any strategy (or lack their of) to acomplish the mission and the story, while not spectacular, is humorous and interesting."
Fantasy dieselpunk anime XCOM where you can actually hit what you're shooting at most of the time.  10/10
"Wonderful game, thoroughly enjoyed it. You get attached to the main characters and if you want to know anything about the side characters, there's always the Personnel files to look at. The story is wonderful and the art / design style is, well, in my opinon awesome. Different languages help to add a bit of spice if you get tired of the voice acting. The onlygripe I have about this game is the tank controls on the PC with mouse and keyboard. Sometimes, the tank becomes 'wonky', kind of stuttering and trying to move at the same time. In other words, kind of hard to drive at times. This game also has the 'What?! NO!' moments when you aim or get hit. While at the same time having 'YES' moments when awesome shots are taken or your low on health and dodge. All in all I highly recommend the game. I still have yet to do all the DLC and the NG mode, so I have something to look forward to."
"a magnificent strategy game kinda easy at the beginning but later... it'll make your brain spins to find the best steps to win the game without major casualities   as for the story well-made plot the suspense. 'creative' setting. (I mean, the location looks like a certain country in a certain region) &lt;- so obvious  characters? 9/10 too 'Japanese' style (cause it's from Japan lol) many interesting characters and nice voice-acting (both English &amp; Japanese)  BUY THIS GAME S O W O R T H I T  (especially when you buy it at the lowest discount steam would give you, i bought it when the game was discount at 75%, lol)   "
"Feels. And lots of them.  Also an excellent and innovative combat system that keeps each battle fresh, really nice (if a tiny bit cliched :) ) writing and some great music.  Paid £7.99 or something for this in the recent sale. Easily worth fullprice so I think all in all it's one of the best deals I ever got off Steam. Highly recommended."
"Valkyria Chronicles has 3 main areas of interest: Story, Art, Gameplay.  The art is peculiar - as you probably already know, it's a drawn/manga style and it's really pleasant to watch. Animation during cutscenes is minimal, it feels more like reading than watching, but it's quite good.  The gameplay is GREAT. You have all your different units, you can level them up, buy equipment, and everyone has potentials and attributes that alter their stats in combat, effectively making each unit unique. This variety means that you've got several ways to play. You potentially COULD have a full sniper team and make it work, if you wanted.  The story is infuriating and left me really bitter. I'm not gonna go into the spoiler zone, but there is that one character that YOU KNOW has to die from the first moment you see it. And what do you know? It does. In the most stupid and illogical way, because apparently that's plot advancing. And everyone will rub this character's death in your face until the end. It's like the storywriters saying 'CRY YOU LITTLE ♥♥♥♥ CRY', and I don't really appreciate this stuff. If this is good enough for you, you'll find the rest of the story satisfying and lovable main characters.  Overall, Valkyria Chronicles is a very good game and will keep you playing for hours and hours."
"I'm currently midway through my second campaign, and words cannot describe how much I have loved this game. However, I shall try!  I picked up this game during the summer sale for an almost criminally low price, but it's more than worth it's full cost to the right gamer. When debating getting the game, most of the reviews I read said things along the lines of 'like Fire Emblem but with guns'. Fire Emblem being my favourite series, this interested me considerably. The gameplay is turn based, but when units are selected, the battle becomes real time, allowing you to move soldiers around dodging enemy fire and finding good hiding spots from which to fell foes. This combination of two strategy game types works surprisingly well and allows you to see the fights from a commander and soldier perspective, which really helps you get immersed in the game.   Story-wise, the tale is set in 1935 on a continent not unlike Europe, between two warring superpowers; the Federation and the Imperials. On the border of these giants is a small country called Gallia, which has remained neutral in the conflict. However, all machinery (both military and otherwise) in this world is powered by a mineral called Ragnite, which Gallian soil holds in abundance, prompting the Imperials to invade. You play as Welkin Gunther, son of a legendary war hero, and members of Squad 7 as you undertake critical missions to push back the invasion and win your freedom!  The events of the story really got to me in some places, both elated moments and tragic ones. This game really takes your emotions for a ride when it wants to!  Music-wise, there is almost no fault to be had anywhere, except that there is not more of it! The different melodies perfectly reflect the scenarios they pair with, and I often found myself extra happy when a tune I liked began.  Overall, this game is one of the best I've ever played, and I heartily recommend it to others, especially if strategy games are your thing."
"Bought this on a whim... Sat down to play and woke up a couple of days later having just experienced one of the best stories in my gaming life. From the art style, through the magnificent music and voice acting and to the sublime gameplay, this title oozes a level of polish that is lacking in this genre.  Now, I'm not normally a fan of JRPG's but this really took a hold of me with its alternative WW2 setting and really makes you think about human nature with its wonderfully written story. Recommend? Absolutely, though not just because you can make an all girl team... It's a game that, maybe on the surface at least, doesn't look all that interesting but rewards those who continue with an experience they'll never forget. Easily one of, it not THE best tactical RPG ever made. Thank you SEGA for bringing this to Steam and please port the second game as well. There're fans waiting."
The game has a few annoying cons but overall experience is definitely positive. Especially I liked the story and level of difficulty.
"Oh so captivating.. I didn't think RPG's with FPS elements could be so noteworthy. Game studios should definitely experiment in this route more often.  I hate to spoil it but if anyone loved Skies of Arcadia, you'd love this. (Vyse makes a cameo) Also, both games share the same director.  Only thing that displeases me, not necesarily about this game, is that there aren't enough like it. 9/10 wouldn't play again but certainly enjoyed it."
"Great Art Style and voice acting, the story is really slow and you have to wait your turn to just attack which is quite boring, but the story and gameplay is good overall."
"Too many Waifus, but not enough harem time, in this magical World Wars stratgety game. The battles have a good feel to them, figuring out how best to win is a challenge, but in the end I feel that the reward is good. The reward is stories about your soldier waifu, or husbando. Always remember Alicia is best girl."
This game is without a doubt one of the best i'v ever played. i beat all but the last chapter on a diffrent account and had to buy it just to have it on mine. Its totally worth the 20$
"Great story, great art, fun and interesting gameplay. There's not much to dislike about the game! I only wish the other two were available on Steam!"
"Pretty easy game to get into, but it's deeper than it first appears. If you are into this sort of thing, there is lots of replayability."
"Easily one of the most satisfying games I've finished in the past 15 years.   A well paced story full of intriguing and well developed characters, Even the minor characters you command have developed personas. The gameplay is a unique mix of top-down turn-based strategy, third-person shooter, and a little first-person as well.  Just play it."
"One of the best Jap games I've played. The art is good, the gameplay is fun, and while there are a few kinks that could be ironed out, its a quality game. 10/10 would play."
"Not exactly what I expected, but a good game none the less. The story is engaging, though proceeds slowly through the presentation mechansim. You'll spend a lot of time watching cutscenes.  The actual gameplay is fun, when you do get to it.  Do yourself a favor and play this with a game pad, though. It's pretty frustrating to play with a keyboard."
Wish steam to has more game like this.
"All in all, this is one of my favorite games of all time. The gameplay brings to mind XCOM, but includes its original, unique BLiTZ turn-based and real-time hybrid system. You'll have a third-person view of your character as you control them with an action meter like those in other turn based JRPGs. The multi-class system opens up numerous strategic possibilities.  In addition to the main characters, there are a few dozen side characters, each with their own personalities, quotes and even swan songs if/when they die. Overall, you start to feel a little attached to Squad 7 as you lead them into battle after battle.   This character attachment, as well as the writing of the plot itself, make the story a rewarding and emotional experience. The game definitely has its share of plot twists. Be prepared to laugh in the best of times and cry in the worst. By the end of the game, you won't want to spare a single one of your Imperial enemies. One thing I must say regarding the story, though, is that it includes its fair share of anime cliches.  Another critique is that at times the game seems too easy. Sure you'll get blown up by a stray tank round every once in a while, but it's almost hard to lose anybody who can permadie (the main characters can be used in the next battle, even if they 'die'). The main difficulties come in the form of boss characters and unexpected enemies.  All in all, though, this game has left me wishing for a remake. The first sequel shares only a universe, and the second isn't even in English. Sony, if you're reading this, know that your story has so much potential beyond what you did with it -- and you have a whole fanbase to support you if you decide to venture down that road. We've developed your side characters, played and replayed your game to no end and even created our own canons. Prospective players, after a few hours with this game, you'll feel the same way.  In a gaming world where AAA titles dominate the landscape, Valkyria Chronicles is truly a fan favorite.  Thanks for the fun, rage and memories."
"Great game! turn based strategy, different classes (sniper, scout, assault, mechanic) really cool graphic style and nice story too with humour. tons of characters with different perks and personalities.  A must have really!"
"Sometimes a game just lands, you know? What can I say; this is one of my favorite games of all time. I easily put a hundred hours into it on my Ps3, and have recommended it to any who would listen. I'm nearing the 30 hour mark on PC and its just as good as when I first discovered it.  The game will probably appeal to fans of the X-com franchise, or maybe Fire Emblem or Advance Wars. The core mechanics are a turn-based squad strategy game, with the action switching to third-person when you select a unit, allowing you to move around the battlefield in semi-real-time. Enemies remain static but will take shots at you should you stray too close. Then their turn lets them move around whilst you take pot shots at them. The various unit types and relative strengths and weaknesses along with cover and flanking bonuses keep things from getting stale as you look to best position your troops for both speed (each mission is ranked based on number of turns used) and strategy.   Where Valkyria Chronicles shines, though, is in its immersive storytelling and unique art style. The story plays out in chapters, with a healthy dose of dialogue and some animated cut scenes preceding and following every mission. I truly got attached both to the main cast of characters and the various soldiers you recruit into Squad 7. (Although the main characters 'tactically retreat' if defeated in battle, the supporting characters DO have a chance of perma-death, and each has a small bio to fill out and personality traits to unlock, so it does sting when you lose one before their time.) Individuals level up, as do classes, and the tech tree is accessible but slowly becomes game changing. The option to grind can make the game a little easy, but the option to boost the difficulty (after your first playthrough) can have the opposite effect, so choose your path.   I've read a lot of the user reviews and some people complain that the dialogue can be a bit hackkneed and cliche. A point I'll fully concede. All I can say is it didn't bother me. I found myself smiling at some of the sillier moments, and very moved at some of the deeper ones. With plenty to unlock, a couple of included DLC packs (including one that lets you play the opposing side for a short completely new campaign) and a new game plus mode, there is a ton to do here.  I could keep writing but I think its obvious: I really love this game. If you've read this far, you're obviously interested in it... do yourself a favor and pick it up. I just hope Sega does us a favor and ports the PSP exclusive sequel and the Japan exclusive third title soon! Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go boot up my next mission. Gallia, to arms!"
"give us valkyria chronicles 2 and 3 on PC, valkyria chronicles 1 was amazing"
Slevaria has big boobs and Rosie can sing.
"Great history and gameplay, fights style are like puzzle."
"I usually write joke reviews, but I don't think that sort of treatment is something Valkyria Chronicles deserves.  This is the best WWII Genre game I have played in a long, long time. It's turn based strategy gameplay is brilliant, tense and rewarding. The atmospthere is fantastic with a decent soundtrack to boot. The use of permadeath for squaddies adds to the immersion. The Fan service is... uh... not common and is reserved for a special chapter. It's lengthy (See hours, it took 75 hours to beat this first try) and the story aint a terrible cliche'd WWII FPS shooter storyline. It doesn't glorify war nor does it make it look innocent, in fact it covers taboo subjects which are basically toned down variants of what you saw in Spec Ops: The Line.   With that said theres a bit of grinding and the intercept fire mechanics are a bit iffy but those are just personal pet peeves.  If you loved games like XCOM: UFO defense and/or it's remake. Consider buying this, it's worth every dime.  10/10  Oh and Sega, if you're reading this. VC2 and VC3 ports. NOW."
"Story starts off with a baker girl up in arms for justice, fighting against the ruthless imperial army bent on gunning everything down.  So that everyone can live together in peace she said.  Minutes later, she starts headshotting imperial soldiers and makes kawaii victory poses &amp; expression with each kill.  It's true when people say war makes soldiers delusional &amp; bloodthirsty.  11/10 very realistic psychological war effects."
"Everything is good except for the happy-go-lucky story about people's lives being only SLIGHTLY disturbed by an invasion of their country. It's not exactly an accurate representation of the horrors of war, when you see cutscenes with people living their happy lives as if nothing happened, when everyone should be aware of the incoming attack. And you got those typical anime tropes in the cutscenes, such as the girl in the gang (who initially is the actual leader of the group but for some reason becomes a subordinate to the dude) stoically watching the corpses of three enemies and poetically closing her eyes, saying 'So... it's begun.' And general over-deepness like that. But enough complaining about the story. It actually does get better over time.  As I said, the game is enjoyable. VC is a nice mix between turn-based strategy and third-person shooters. Someone complained about the game's tactics being to 'just rush the enemy before they can shoot you', but frankly, that's pretty much what war is about. Killing the other one before they kill you. So they got the gameplay part right. And the graphics fit the game. Kinda generic soundtrack. But, uncommonly for anime-style games, the voice acting is actually very good. For being published by SEGA, I'd say the devs did a really good job overall."
My 65 years old shocktrooper recieved a perfect snipe shot in the head. With a missile. From a tank. And Survived.  My 12 year old engineer killed more enemy soldiers than my high leveled tank.  10/10 would send people of inapropiate ages to war again.
"SCORE: 6/10  I *really* thought I would love this game based upon graphics, game style, FRPG with tactics. But here is why I had to stop playing it: (1) the controls are abysmal, like truly bad, obviously a console port but with zero effort to make them even remotely acceptable, and I tries mouse and keyboard and controller. (2) Enemy turns can take forever as each guy moves. It reminds me of Codename STEAM on 3DS which suffered similar super long enemy turns. (3) There are some major difficulty spikes (level 7 is horrible) and this exacerbates #2. (4) The 20 turn limit is really freaking stupid. I'm ok with all other tactical design choices, but artificially limiting the options with a hard turn cap is just ridiculous. (5) The cutscenes were not updated and look identical to PS3, which is ok, but not ideal.  XCOM is one of my favorite games ever. I love Fire Emblem, Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy Tactics, Divinity Original Sin, many JRPG and some anima - many games and genres that would portend that I would love this game. But it was tedious, boring, and too difficult at times (and I usually play most games on hard)."
Great spin on tactics games.    10/10
great story great visuals fun tactical gameplay - no grinding!  love it!
"So glad to see this game on Steam. The first game I bought for the PS3 and still one of the best I have for the old box, not bad for an accidental purchase.   Old fashioned turn based strategy game with anime graphical style and tanks. The plot line is detailed if tramlined and the characters develop interestingly as the story continues. While side missions exist they are occassional, and usually in completely random although entertaining directions.  In my opinion one of the best of this genre with the addition of being one of the best looking anime style games for its era as well. Well worth a try."
"It's not often that I say this, but buy it on a console. The PC port has clunky controls that debilitate gameplay, and the game crashes randomly. Steam says I played for 20 hours, but I spent four of those hours replaying missions after the game crashed. I'm sure at least 45 minutes was wasted on my tank getting stuck on nothing, slowly draining my action points."
"Battles are horribly long, game is horribly long (a million cutscenes), losing in a battle will destroy your will to play this game (replay battle from the beginning).  Also no autosave, which is incredibly nice, so you can replay all the battles you completed again and again! And the PC controls aren't terrible, but not amazing.  I find the characters barely relatable to, both heroes and villains (Welkin the most boring, bland main character in any game/anime story I have ever encountered, Alicia would've been a better choice), and the vast number of characters you can choose on your squad is nice, as it gives more chance of finding likable characters, but there are a lot, perhaps too many.  And the battle mechanics need polishing, no undo for travelling for each character, the real time/turn based hybrid system of enemies can shoot at you on your turn sounds good in practise but I dislike, and things like lancer fire not doing damage because of missing the enemy by a stupidly small distance (AKA one foot away), an overly simple training system for units, and sluggish 'book'(menu) navigation.  Put simply, there are a thousand times I've sworn loudly because a sniper or lancer misses when you definitely expect them to hit the target or at least do some damage. Same goes for tank cannon fire on an infantry solider, no damage if you hit the ground around them, but oh, for some reason the mortar does the whole nearby damage thing....  And way too many cutscenes, also [minor spoiler?]     Chapter 7 with the Supertank, where the ♥♥♥♥ is the acutal Gallian Army? Why is the milita fighting this beast? And where the ♥♥♥♥ did the tank come from anyway, don't you think they should've spotted that huge thing in the middle of a barren desert in the last battle? Or even before then? Questionable Gallian intelligence...  For full price, I can't recommend this game, but for sale price of around 3.74 I guess it was worth my purchase."
"Yes, you should buy it. Yes."
"Love this game. Now, if only we could get the rest of them... I'd buy them ASAP. FOR GALLIA!!   ...Also, love Selvaria's smile. So sweet..."
"Valkyria Chronicles is like an anime XCOM set in a fictional WW2 setting with each squad member having unique and (for the most part) interesting backgrounds. Only complaints I have are: The tanks are difficult to control at times. The dialouge in each cutscene is awful. You cannot skip the enemy's turn. That aside, I really enjoy this game and I can definitly recommend it if you are a fan of turn based strategy and narrative driven games. "
"First things first: Very story focused game. If you're not interested in story I would not recommend it.   As for the rest of the game. A decent chunk of characters had voices that made me cringe somewhat. Visuals otoh I found to be quite appealingl. Of course if that's what you wanted to know about you should be looking at the screenshots at the top. Not this review here. Concerning actual gameplay. I do feel I need to say some missions can unfortunately be completed laughably quick if you want to be gamey but if you don't cheese things to hell most missions offer a reasonable challenge. (Atleast they did for me, somebody who has no experience whatsoever in turn based tactical games like this). In the end most of the game worked as one'd want. Tanks however seem to insist on doing weird things while you're driving them and I also had one character fall through the ground into oblivion, luckily bugs remained limited to that particular incident."
"Great turn-based strategy game with a buttload of unique characters to choose from, each with their own lines! Just don't ruin the fun by getting the Ruhm from Selvaria's DLC before finishing the main story once.   The only problem I had was that I can't 'walk' using the keyboard - the arrow keys gives the run command. But hey, I got all the achievements without buying a controller so it's clearly not a big problem."
"This game has swiftly become one of my favourites, while I haven't played it nearly as much as some of my other games it is nonetheless the most enjoyable. The characters are loveable with the humour and romance adding to their development. The game takes a very unique take on strategy games allowing you to customise your teams, bringing in characters that work well with different characters, opponants and environments. The story is also an interesting take on war where you are fighting to save a small peaceful nation rather than a huge warmongering empire. The gameplay is solid and very tactical and while sometimes unfairly balanced, it remains incredibly tactical. If you like the art style of anime/manga, like games with a good story, intense strategy and games where you get to know and love each individual character no matter their significance to the plot than this is a must have game for you. However if you don't care for large chuncks of dialogue and a more 'story telling' kind of game than perhaps you should stick to watching gameplay on youtube... or just skip through the text (mashing the left click, enter key or spacebar should do the trick but I wouldn't recommend it, the story telling is on point)."
"Ok, it calims to be a turn based strategy. Well, it some how is but during the fight you alse need to act fast and press the correct buttons to finish the fights opimally and not die. I kind of like the sketchy style, the over cute characters and the handsome story. Will I play it through in new game+? Will I play the included dlc? No! I wish for XCOM 3..."
"You like Anime's? You like war dramas and war scenes? You like tank battles?   Do you like to cry like a little girl when your favorite character dies on the field, because you're just not good at strategy games?   If you answered to all of these games with a brave and proud 'YES SIR!'. Then you were born for this game.   It has some flaws when controlling the tank, but still managable. What I loved the most is... English Subtitles and Original Japanese voices. You can of course choose the dubbed version, but the original is really cool.   Would recommend!"
"Good game, worth your money."
"What I liked most about Valkyria Chronicles is that it has a mix of RPG/RTS elements that offers you the 'overlord' ability of the overal view of the battlefield, as well as controlling units action and position (yes you CAN actually control each character's special ability and position under the third person view)  Everything about Valkyria Chronicles are A+ 10/10 ratings; the variety of play style, the difficulty of each mission, as well as a rich and robust off-game customizable system (for you tanks, weapons and soldiers) and additional extra contents that you can read, interact, adn even side missions for you to explore your battle strats.  The only problems I had is the saving ability (sometimes it kinda failed to save my progress) some of the cutscenes are unskippable, in which I wish they could be skippable considering that everytime you lose you would have to see them all over again. But good overal impression so far."
"Pros - Fun art style - Enjoyable story - Side quests / missions / skirmishes - Easy game mechanics (also fun)  - Awesome character dyanmics  Cons - No way to save during a battle (some battles run long and if you need to go, you'll need to start over fresh. Really annoying when you screw up and have to start over from the very start).   Other - I don't know how I feel about the story mode... one of my favorite thing is controlling my characters, doing stuff with them, meeting new people. With this mode, you are pigeon holed to the story, and the only time you get to 'be your character' is when you are in battle."
"my hours is a lie, my save file has 13 hours on it, and playing through this game was amazing. I loved the story, the gameplay is solid and relatively accurate for the era its portraying. the only things i have against it is tanks spazing in control with a mouse, but thats fixed if you play on controller.   warning, if you dont want a game to rip your heart out with the feeling, dont play this. otherwise, an amazing game that im glad made it onto steam."
Aimme done right with a well done ending. Love the art and its all for 20$ what more do I need to say? seeing that any other 'good game ' will cost you 60$ for half of the game and than 804 for the other half 'dlc'
I loved this game on the psp but it is even better on pc
"Beautiful game, a true piece of art. Great story, beautiful scenery, an interesting combat formula. However, ever since I bought and started playing this game on my desktop, I've had problems with processes starting up again that I had turned off because they were using up space on my hard drive. Also, strange random crashes, if a grenade gets stuck somewhere, you should close the game and possibly restart your computer before the came crashes, or worse, your computer blue screens. Point is, I recommend this game for its sake, but I think people should do some research into it to see if it has problems running on computers that have certain hardware and/or software installed, or certain brands of computer products. All the crashes started after I started playing Chapter 8 map 2 about 2 weeks ago, I have yet to beat this map because of the crashes."
"Great game, very fun and adictive. So say goodbye to your friends because you will not stop playing this game until you finish it. Also if you have played Skies of Arcadia you will get the same feeling and as a bonus there is a cameo from Vyse and Aika. Any chance we got Skies of Arcadia Legends?"
Aimed gun perfectly at enemy's head with sniper. Shot wall around enemy.  Turn ended. Sniper was killed.  Threw laptop on the ground. 10/10 Would miss again.

"I bought this at the latest sales, and I didn't expect such a pleasant surprise.  This is a really great turn-by-turn RPG/action game. The battles are nice and challenging, the graphisms are refreshing and really give a sense of immersion, and the story / scenario goes deep.  As some other commentors said, it's quite a lot story based, so there are a lot of cutscenes, but the fights will still give you a lot of work. The classes system is nicely done and you'll clearly need to manage your 5 classes of soldiers in order to win your fights. The fact that all chars of a given class level up at the same time is a nice touch, since you don't have to grind your chars.  Basically, I only had to do one or two 'skirmish battles' (ie, replayable battles that are not part of the main plot and that allow you to up your XP) so the main plot by itself is almost sufficient. There is also a challenge/completionist aspect: you earn ranks for each battle depending on how many turns you needed, and there are quite a few 'unrelevealed' achievements that you need to find.  You can save as much as you want, which, IMO, is nice.  A few negative points, though: * Quite a few times, the battles can turn around on just one 'hit or miss', so the chance aspect is quite present. Be ready to load/save around this kind of shots. * It's a bit slow: when it's the ennemy turn, you have to watch all moves in x1 speed, and you can't skip this. I found that a bit frustrating."
"This game is amazing. when i first saw it i thought meh i will just give it ago i need something to play. after the first hour i was already hooked. 30 hours in and im still having alot of fun the story is an emotional ride and the game tactics are alot of fun,  CON: the game favours rushing the enemy which isn't a bad thing unless you just want to take your time to do each map with total domination."
"Just completed the game... phew! One of the best games played recently, we need more games like this on steam. Storyline is superb. 10/10 -- a must play."
"This game deserves some love. It had a unique and interesting plot. It had some pretty good combat (Besides trying to drive the tank, that was the worst thing ever) And then it had bad things, The guy in R&amp;D who never opens his eyes, One of his best friends dies and he just frowns but he doesn't open his eyes. His eyes are probably blackholes. 10/10 Definitely original Brock  But this game is good. 9/10"
"The first VC I've played is VC2 which is very satisfying IMO. This game is worth buying, the features are amazing, the plot, the gameplay, the system conditions, although I would say the AIs are stupid as fk LOL even with hard mode.   SPOILER ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ WATCH OUT FOR THE MISSION where you need to capture the train rails, there's a bug on the wall whenever you try to climb up to destroy the gatling guns, you will slip/fall inside the wall and end up getting stuck on the bottom."
"Turn-based strategy with an original twist and a reach story.  *Story* The plot is derived from WW2 and contains several twists that left me surprised. It is told through a great number of cut-scenes and dubbed dialogue. The characters are often likeable, but also often annoyingly naive for a setting that references a war and a genocide. *Gameplay* Unlike Fire Emblem and X-Com, instead of moving on fields, you have a meter of agility points that tells you how much longer you can keep running with a soldier from your troop. The game manages to be a turn-based strategy and almost a third person shooter at the same time. *Graphics* Originally this was a PS3 exclusive, so the graphics are decent unless you hate the Anime look.  A must-play for fans of the genre. And overall a solid game."
I cri evry tiem
"It's always a bad sign when a PC port's title screen invites you to 'Press Start button.'  Unfortunately, this common oversight really does signal deeper problems. Valkyria Chronicles has terrible PC UI. Sega doesn't seem to have bothered to do more than map controller buttons to semi-arbitrary keys. In menus, there is absolutely NO option to use a mouse - you must navigate with WASD or arrow keys. Confusingly, however, some menus (not all!) require you to click with the mouse to confirm your selection once you have navigated to it via the keyboard.  The half-baked interface is a shame, because other aspects of this port actually do seem to have been done with some care. The game looks great and ran smoothly and problem-free for as long as I tried to make myself get past the interface problems. Ultimately, though, I just can't. Your mileage may vary, especially if you are willing to break out a controller."
a good game kinda cool =) i think I might see this game to the end
fun and unique game play with a very intresting world prepare to cry if you cant stand not having a perfect score probaly the best part was the concentration camps and nazis also one of my favoite turn based strategy games ever
"must play, very story rich but if you hate long cutsence, this game is recommend for you."
"First off. Beautifully crafted game even for a port it runs smoother than butter. That aside I love the story so far. Character development is awesome. Oh, and did i mention this has feels... not Last of Us grade feels. but pretty feely feels. I hold this game up high as one of my favorites and at some points don't want to beat it because I dont want the story to be over. What I'm saying here is, I wish I knew this series existed before now. I played a demo for one on PSP and I regret not doing more research into it. I HIGHLY reccomend this game for anyone looking for a game to play, just to play a game. it's not competative and really not all that tactical if you use your mind instead of just charging in. Just play it. Even if you dont like Anime or RTS's there is something for everyone in this game."
Still visually impressive and story rich game with nice characters and somewhat original game mechanics.  Love it
"Fantastic game, I definetly recommend.  It is a story game though, so if that isn't your thing, probably just skip everything. If you DO enjoy these kinds of games, defiently get it!  The gameplay part, is pretty good. It takes a cool twist on RTS and lets you control the characters. The characters also having back stories so you kind of devolp a bond with them.  Plus the story, I really enjoyed and have a soft spot for."
"Fantastic. I haven't had this much fun with a game for a long time. The story skillfully balances charming light-hearted fun with poignant drama, creating an atmosphere that's a pleasure to enjoy while being serious enough to pull at the 'ol heart strings.  The game play is great. It was like returning to the past, when games were actually fun and tactical strategy games still existed. There are a few bugs and quirks but never enough to really hurt the enjoyment of game. The pros far outweigh the cons.  The music is excellent. It really inspires you during combat.  I would've liked to have seen more of the squad during cut scenes, but I was surprised they were individually voiced and had unique characteristics. It really helps immerse you in the game when you're not commanding a bunch of clones or bad ♥♥♥ super-soldiers.  I had no idea this game would be this good, but believe me - it is. It's actually quite lengthy as well. I would love to see similar games in the future"
"TL;DR A fresh take on turn based stratedgy gaming, with an interesting setting and plot, hampered by some very cheesy exploits/balancing and the PC port is good overall, but could be better. Controller recommended. Worth it in my opinion, it was one of the better games on the PS3.  I played a bit of Valkyria Chronicles on the PS3, but rebought it on PC as I never finished it. The port is pretty good, though you should know that the framerate affects an important game mechanic called 'intercept damage'. Which means that as you move a unit, being within range and line of a sight of an enemy unit will damage the unit you are moving. So if you play at 60 FPS, intercept damage is twice as effective. Though I personally think it makes shocktroopers a little more balanced, they now do their damage/defensive role better. It also makes the game more difficult, and I like that extra tension myself. Besides, 60 FPS makes it look so much better in motion that I couldn't pass it up. There are also some mods that enhanced character textures and remove the white canvas border during gameplay segments that I appreciated asthetically.  Onto the game; it is an interesting take on turn based stratedgy, and it comes SRPG, Third Person Shooter, turn based and real time elements. The classes all serve a purpose, and while Scouts are a little too good because they can move so far each command, they all work fine and have interesting pros and cons. I found the shooter and real time elements were more appealing to me than usual SRPG mechanics. Also, each unit in any of the 5 classes of units will level up together, so you don't need to worry about micro-managing experience points I've been told happens alot in games like Fire Emblem. If one scout is level 10, all scouts are level 10. Though not all classes have to be the same level, so you could have level 10 scouts and level 8 lancers and level 5 snipers if you felt like pumping most of your experiences points into scouts. Though the equipment on each unit can be customized individually. The story is actually really good, with the game set in episodic chapters where Cutscenes and Visual Novel elements tell the story in between the battles. The setting is a dieselpunk, alt history ww2 world, but with anime and water colour asthetics and I absolutely love it. The story can get pretty dark, with themes racism/antisemitism and loss, though it has brighter moments too. The characters that make up Squad 7 tend to be pretty interesting, and everyone has perks that represent their personality, some good and some bad. While these perks are not necessary, they add flavour and depth for those who seek it. The game should take a while to beat, probably 20ish hours for the standard playthrough. With side mission skirmishes, include DLC missions from consolesand a new game plus to keep you playing if you really want to keep going. Though there is no multiplayer, which wasn't added until the PSP sequel Valkyria Chronicles 2 was released."
One of the most story rich and awesome strategy based games that i wished there would be even a sequel or games just like this one. The art and gameplay both unique make one of my favorite games even at present.
"I will say this, the Japanese really know how to make a good video game. I absolutely loved this game :D. It is focused on gameplay and a very interesting story!"
Only thing bad about this game is that it ends....
"Listen, when a game from 2008 gets ported to PC, and immediately is more well received than let’s say, Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Unity.  It says a lot for how well this game has aged. It’s a JRPG/RTS hybrid that has a gorgeous sketchbook art style, an intense battle system, and some very strong characters."
"The most thrilling game i have play in a while, a great story with the feel train, and awesome gameplay, a new way to play a war game.  4.8/5"
"Love the game, but hate the PC controls. Driving the tank is difficult and clunky, and I often waste movement getting stuck on something because the tank decided to just veer in a different direction. Then I waste command points trying to fix some BS that shouldn't have happened in the first place."
"It is an absolutely gorgeous game. I never owned a PS3 so I never got to play this when it was new, but man. It's just so pretty. If you can appreciate the art, and don't mind a turn-based tactical RPG battle style along the lines of, say, XCOM: Enemy Unknown (it's not grid-based like XCOM, but it's very similar), this is the game for you. The story is rich in emotion and once you see the Valkyria in action... I can't speak to replayability, as I haven't replayed it. But I want to think I would."
"Great game, very peculiar dynamics. Nice strategy, mixing a turn-based system with real-time action. The result works surprisingly well (I would like a multiplayer of this!)  The only major drawback is that 80% of the time you will be waiting for an animation to end, or to go from a menu to another, etc. SO MUCH WASTED TIME. It gets on my nerves! But I managed to finish it though.   If you like its anime-like looks and like strategy games, give it a go. If you are easily mortified by waiting... then consider yourself warned.   PS: This game is hard on perfectionists. Since quite a lot can depend on luck (perhaps a cannon will hit its target, perhaps it won't) you will have to reload constantly if you want to finish battles in as few turns as possible (which is encouraged)."
20 hours 20$ worth it 8/8
I hope that one day I will see Valkyria Chronicles 4
"This is a very story driven game. Even if you are not into cutscenes or relationships, the gameplay is still pretty solid. It has a turn based system with aim to shoot features. The only thing I found frustrating about this game is that it is heavily reliant upon your luck. If your luck is not great like mine; your snipers will miss headshots at point blank range."
"What would have happened during WWII if the nazis and USSR where totally united under a single banner, and same for the West ?   This game has the answer : the belgian baker girl apprentice would kick their ♥♥♥ so hard you almost pity them.   Let's take back the village where all began : said girl, by herself, kills 2 shocktroopers, 3 snipers, 1 tank, 1 heavy infantry with a rocket launcher and capture the enemy base, making it a victory... in one single turn. Just awesome."
"This game is for when you feel too Japanese to play XCOM.  8/10  +Great gameplay, love the turn-based, third person shooter style. +Some great characters and squadmates +Jann  -Pretty cheesy, dialogue like you'd expect from an anime. Not a con if you like that sort of thing. -Some not so great characters and squadmates -Predictable story and plot twists -Linear tech tree   "
"This Is a good game, nothing else I can say about it :D"
"A charming romp through semi-mystical pseudo-Europe, Valkyria Chronicles is a lovable underdog story, told with all the cliches and stereotypes that are commonplace to the narrative. Though it offers nothing remarkable in terms of story, the characters shine through and the tale of this quirky group of outnumbered, outmatched militia-men facing off against a monolithic war-machine will keep you spellbound. With its lovable cast of protagonists and secondary characters, who succeed in evolving as the story progresses, beautiful cell-shaded artwork and intuitive mechanics, Valkyria Chronicles promises to entertain you, as you fall in love with its cast of misfits.  There's no denying Valkyria Chronicles follows a cookie-cutter plot. It tells the tale a vicious and nearly omnipotent empire seeking the valuable unobtainium hidden within the borders of a small, neutral nation. Galia fins itself caught in the middle as two superpowers clash in this backdrop of magical pseudo-Europe at war. The story is simple but its overtone of acceptance, resistance and camaraderie still carry weight.  Th true strength of Valkyria Chronicles lies in its cast of quirky and unforgettable characters. While some of the primary cast fall into typical JRPG roles, most of the characters, including a slew of unique and remarkable secondary characters, are fantastic. You'll find yourself weighing every decision and regretting the loss of every felled squadmate. The unlockable backstories and models are a nice touch that help you feel more intimate with the soldiers under your command.  Additionally, Valkyria Chronicles sports some of the most beautiful artwork to date. A throwback to the dawn of cell-shaded games, the graphics can feel a little dated to some, but the charm still holds. Characters, background and every detail from clothing to weaponry has something to love, even if it lacks the polish of more recent releases.  Unfortunately, this charm and love does not follow through to the control scheme. The fact that the game is a port is obvious from the awkward and clunky key mapping. Despite these faults, the game's mechanics are intuitive and undeniably revolutionary. Playing through your turn in a third-person perspective, with immediate repercussions for miss-steps and mistakes, adds an additional layer of depth and enjoyment to an already phenomenal game.  Though the game lacks much of a story, or challenge, its lovable cast, charming artwork and enjoyable gameplay make it a worthwhile purchase, despite the cliche narrative and JRPG tropes."
Great game and gameplay.
This game is really good and I highly recommend. Nice strategic take of a war game and beautiful gameplay.
"Clearly this game is one of the best games I´ve ever played. it got a FANTASTIC art style, very fun gameplay. relative long gameplay. all we need now is the the Valkyria Desendants (2nd &amp; 3rd ones) on steam and not just on consol!"
"Valkria Chronicles is an anime style turn based strategy role playing game that makes everyone who plays it ask,' where is Valkyria Chronicles 2?' With a beautiful art style, awesome story, interesting characters, tanks at your control, and the ability to seriously wreck your oppenents, why would not by this game? This has you go on suicide mission of random difficulty (depends on the player). If you know how to play the game, ya gonna get rekt. If you know how to actually play the game, you will do fine. Plus if you needed to break the game, plat the dlc missions. If you complete them, you get game breaking guns to own all of your scrub enemies. One final piece of advise, walkthrough are practilly useless for this game, so rely on your own abilities.  10/10 Would atempt to destroy a huge tank that is at least 10 time bigger and better equipped than my tank again #BewareTheIdesOfChapter7"
"I've heard of this game a while back, but I have never had the chance to play it because I hadn't had a game console since 2001 (the first Playstation). My first impressions for this game wasn't really very good as I'm really not a big fan of a slideshow narrative, cheesy dialogue, and turn based shooters. As I get used to the game and understand its narrative, I'm quickly became a fan of this game. There's so much story on this game and I've been playing this for more than a week, trying to balance work and this game. I quickly forgotten about GTA5 for this and I had this itch to push the story forward. I've just recently completed the game at the time of writing. I can say that I would definitely recommend this game for the story alone. I'd wish they'd make a proper sequel to this.  Also, if you don't like the slideshow narrative, this also has an Anime adaptation."
"Very fun and enjoyable game. I have played it again and again to my hearts content. A nice game, with cartoon graphics. It has one glitch, getting up the metal ramp on level 18 at times, but that's it. I would buy this game again."
• Wide range of resolutions supported • Unlockable framerate (Gameplay code locked to thirty frames per second)
Great turn based strategy game with a beautiful art style.
Controls are wierd for a port. but good story and awesome gameplay.
"I love it and hate it. I love the art style, the story, and the game world. I hate the controls and the combat. You can tell its a direct port of the PS3 game by the controls. The tank is almost impossble to control, unless you're going in a straight line. Combat is ok, but the dice-roll gunplay sucks. I constantly find myself shooting at guys at less then 3 feet, but the character misses the entire time. Then when its the enemy turn, they hit you every time."
"This is simply a great strategic, turn based, JRPG, with a good story.   It's so good I'm want to earn all the STEAM achievements for it.   A VC player's progression: - OoOoOo Waifu - I'm the best commander ever! - Why am I so terrible at this game? - Farm Skirmish 7 - Farm Skirmish 7 - Farm Skirmish 7 - Rosie OP, Alicia OP, Orders OP - NG+ - Rosie OP, Alicia OP, Orders OP - CHEESE MASTER  I reallly hope VC2 and VC3 come to port and are just as good as this game."
"You can feel that the makers of this game wanted every little detail to be perfect. And it shows, everything is smooth and polished. The gameplay and story are absolutely fantastic and with the music it makes for an exciting cocktail. This is the best translation of normal people who are thrown in to war with all the emotions who com with it. You really start to feel for the characters.  Replay value is very high and next to this there is lots of background story and some RPG elements. But the game exists of 50% gameplay and 50% story/video, if you want continuously action this is not the game for you. But for most people this is a absolute no brainer to buy. "
"Valkyria Chronicles is one of those rare anime-based games that truly does not suck. It's both a interactive novel and a turn-based strategy game. The story takes you along to points of conflict, then you must engage in the conflict yourself. If either of these elements had not been up to par, then the game would have suffered. However, to my surprise, both the story and the action parts of this game are very well done. Any anime worth watching will at some point make you cry, and this game accomplished that. As for the gameplay, it's also quite good, if you are a fan of turn-based strategy games like me (X-Com, Civ). Though the gameplay is a bit different than most turn-based strategies I have played, the basic concept is the same. You get X units of time to perform actions during your turn, then the enemy does the same. The way Valkria Chronicles implements this moves the action along at a faster, smoother pace than with games like X-Com and Civ.   Overall, this game surprised me at how good it was. I bought it on sale not expecting a whole lot, and it has ended up being the game I have played the most recently. Both the story and the gameplay keep me coming back for more. Terrific job by the developers."
"10/10. One of the best JRPGS for the PS3 makes it way to the PC. Gameplay, plot, music, visuals, and characters are all top notch. I love this game.   Make sure you download the HD mod for this game. It makes a big difference."
"Unique combination of turn based and real time strategy. While the visuals are reminiscent of anime, the story has very few tropes typical for that medium, they appear mostly at the beginning of the game."
"Valkyria Chronicles mixes classic tactical combat with some real time action game elements, it works wonders. The pacing of the game is amazing: it introduces new mechanics and new ways to use weapons and the stages in good increments, to keep things fresh and interesting. The art style is also nice, mixing manga elements (like visual representation of sound effects and action lines) with traditional anime aesthetic. In addition to all that, the game has a nice story, likable characters and some good lore to back it up.  It's a great game for tactics enthusiasts and RPG fans alike!"
Good turn based strategy game to play
"This game is awesome.   Pros- Great story Great characters Good combat Interesting Great art Great music  Cons- Long enemy turns sometimes make for frustrating gameplay...usually only when you're doing badly  This story made me feel things. It had good pacing, dealt with interesting and important issues, and while didn't execute things flawlessly it still handled them pretty damn well.   I loved it, laughed with it, cried with it, fought, and ultimately ended up coming through feeling like I had experienced exactly what it wanted me to.   I particularly praise the unique personalities of each of your soldiers-for at the end when you lost people, it actually felt like you had lost someone, and not just lost an asset.   It's a great game. Very well done. You should totally buy this game.,"
Pretty good.
"Its been a while since a game's story has had me this up in arms. Probably the best part of this game is the story but its not without it's kinks. Story wise, everyone is better fleshed out than the main character (Typical anime problems) but he does have his moments. You will probably feel things from this story, but thats only if you can get past the later stages or rage.  The combat is unforgiving, albiet entertaining, if you know how to use strategy, if not, you're just going to have a bad time.   *oh no, laziness*"
Good tatical strategy with fun anime-esque narrative.
Best strategy game I've played in a long time.  -Great anime artstyle -love japanese takes on a western setting IE Dark Souls MGS etc -Balanced gameplay and tons of customization and upgrades (unless you scout rush)  10/10 would buy again.    
"Nice Game play , very good story , team members grown to my heart if only 1 dies alt+f4 is the sollution . My game 2015"
"Descriptions are kind of Vague, Especially chapter 7, Blasted the Blue Ruin walls with lancer but it just refuses to fall. Hit box problem i guess?"
In one of the reports you can see Alicia in her swiming suit. 10/10 best game ever
"A wonderful game.   It's like playing an anime and watching it at the same time.  I'm quite sad that VC 2 and VC 3 will most likely never come to PC since, as far as I know, they were made for the PSP only.  Pros: -Rich in lore -Interesting turn-based gameplay  -Can provide a challenge on higher difficulties -The aesthetic is gorgeous  -Your squad members aren't randomised cannon fodder like i.e. X-COM, but each have their own design, personality and backstory, allowing you to create a squad filled with people you actually like and care for.  Cons: -Could use some more skirmish maps and DLC's like Edy's detachement. -Every single mission has a limit of 20 turns, and I like to take my time and realise my strategies bit-by bit. This one is a half-con as other people may see it as a pro, because it encourages swift thinking. -The only way to play as the opposite side is via a DLC and it's only 2 missions :(  "
Put simply this game is well worth the money spent on it and the time spent playing it.
"A beautiful game that is fun to play. Highly recommended for fans of war games or anime style graphics.  Likes - An engaging storyline that makes the player go on just to see how the story goes. - Pretty responsive controls. (Used an XBox 360 controller) - Gorgeous graphics.  Dislikes - A few missions make little sense. (in other words, you'll need to cheat a bit and use weird tactics from a walkthrough somewhere)"
An incredibly fun strategy game similar to X-com. 10/10
"Disclaimer: I had already played through this quite a bit on the PS3 version before I bought it, so I had a pretty decent idea what I was getting into when I bought this. From a porting standpoint, I feel like they did a great job aside from tank steering randomly getting buggy at times.  Story: (that's why we play RPGs...right?) The story is very character-driven, which I personally love but that's not necessarily for everyone. You will gain an irrational attachment to some characters after using them in a few missions and they all have their unique quirks and personalities. The unfortunate thing about this is pretty much everyone in your squad isn't developed in the great way the main cast is. It makes sense to be that way since every single member of your squad is optional aside from the core characters, but I can't help but think the story would be even more immersive if you could find out about the supporting cast aside from their bios. I'd rate the story a good 9/10 on the enjoyment scale.  Gameplay: I've loved tactical RPGs since playing Final Fantasy Tactics on the PS1. The gameplay doesn't present anything that would disappoint someone that likes turn-based strategy games. It might be a little on the easy side, but it is engaging, fun, and has reasonable replay value to it. My only complaint for gameplay is the way the mission ranking system works. Revolving only around the total number of turns it takes to complete the mission objectives somewhat encourages abandoning actual tactical movements in favor of abusing system mechanics. Orders are REALLY strong and in a lot of cases the most straightforward way to get an A-rank is just mindlessly buff a unit (Alicia OP) and have them run through enemy lines by themselves while effectively incincible. Oh, and almost never move/use your tanks unless the objective is to get a tank somewhere.  In a realistic war scenario, even if you somehow sneak into and take a base surrounded by enemies...one person alone isn't going to hold that base, and the enemy isn't going to simply retreat because one person is a mile away from the rest of their unit holding that base. I feel like this would be improved if the enemy ace / tanks / commanders killed played into more than just how much exp/gold you get from the mission. Taking out an ace or disabling an extra five tanks would help the war quite a bit in normal circumstances. Gameplay itself 10/10 Ranking system 5/10  Music: The soundtrack is solid and helps keep you immersed in the story. 8/10  TL;DR - If you're a fan of turn-based strategy games, character-driven stories, or just cute girls killing things, this game is for you."
"An excellent port of a great game, and at a reasonable price. Valkyria Chronicles uniquely blends anime styling and tropes with military historical fiction in X-COMesque squad based tactics gameplay. The game's unique CANVAS engine renders everything as though it was a sketch which adds to the immersion and feel of the game. Although late game can boil down to using one strategy over and over (Scout Rush) the game still provides you with a number of options to solve each scenario. Definitely worth a buy."
Great game! I purchased it when it was on sale and I knew nothing about this game before I purchased it. But this is indeed a great game and I'm so glad I brought it! Highly recommend!
"Summary. A really fun game, that is also in places horribly designed and often a terrible experience to play.  Pros. *Beautiful art style and a great soundtrack *Really interesting concept and execution, seamlessly integrates RTS and FPS elements into a really enjoyable and replayable package, especially in the skirmishes.  Cons. *A lame and predictable story *No restart button and autosave means if you ever screw up, you're better off intentionally losing instead of returning to menu to try again *Lack of explanation of a number of the exact numbers with given features (Such as auto dodge and the like) can leave you befuddled when a unit can dodge, from behind, multiple times in a row, perfect sniper rounds to their head. *Easily exploitable mechanics that seem to be present solely for the purposes of exploits (Orders) which actually discourages actual squads of mixed units when one or two boosted units can do the missions much much easier and faster. *Almost every story match has a mechanic that is not explained, and will be, often seemingly intentionally, completely contrary to the way the game has played up to that point, and will play from that point on, almost every time causing serious problems if not total wipeouts to your squad (IE, level 14's infinite spawning waves and the giant tank boilers in level 7 to name the two worst offenders of this).  Conclusion. *Even though the game itself has a number of VERY large flaws, I'd still reccomend it, however for casual players I would HIGHLY reccomened at least skimming a summary of the unique battle mechanics for each fight before going into them. Even for less casual players, unless you wish to suffer at the hands of unexplained mechanics on an almost mission to mission basis in often unrealistic (In the scope of the fictional world created for the game) ways."
"Story starts out quite good, but then gets pretty meh as the game goes on. The combat system is also interesting, but overtime it just feels tedious. The art and voice acting is nice though. Game provides a good challenge, but the difficulties of missions are kind of wonky. Some are very difficult to complete and others you can complete in like 2 turns. Might just be the way I was playing it though. Took me around 30 hours to finish and there is a lot of extra story dialogue and stuff I did not get into."
This game is good
This game has fun game play and an amazing story.  
"Great strategy game, reminded me a lot of Fire Emblem.  Loved the gameplay and the diversified missions. Only bigger issue for me was that you couldn´t skip a lot of cutscenes, especially not being able to skip through the enemy round was sometimes quite a pain to watch.  WARNING: Storyline can be SUPER CHEESY. Like, extra extra extra cringe-2000 cheesy.  Still, was a fun game, can recommend it. 8/10"
"Valkyria Chronciles is one of the best strategic turn based JRPG out there. Unique and addicting gameplay, great story and cutscenes, loveable characters. Definitly worth it for anyone into JRPGS."
"Pros: + Combat is fun and satisfying if everything goes according to plan. + The artstyle looks great. + I like that each squad member has its own personality, likes, and dislikes. Gives them identity.  Cons: - Clunky and dated UI. Navigating the menus is a tedious process. - The game frequently requires player input to progress during dialogue sequences. - Unskippable cutscenes and enemy movement turns. - Too much loading screens. - The game's RNG is poor and can be frustrating at times. I keep missing point blank shots! - The main characters exhibit all the typical anime clichés.  I want to like this game and keep playing, I really do but the clunky UI and horrible RNG keeps turning me off."
This game is a great combination of turn based strategy with some 3rd person shooting mixed in. The combat system is complicated enough to reward creative thinking and strategy.   The graphics and music gave me a Final Fantasy Tactics vibe while I was playing it which was excellent. The story is also very good and feels almost like a Band of Brothers story. For anyone looking for a good tactical turn based strategy game with a great story I highly recommend it.
"If you watched the anime series Valkyria Chronicles, you'll love the game. It follows the story from the TV show but adds it's own twist to it. Each and every aspect of this game is great and worth your time to play. The art, style, character features and cutscenes are all great but speaking of cutscenes there is a lot of them; so if you're more into gameplay then actual story then this isn't the game for you. Throughout the TV show I always wanted to experience what it was like to play the role of these character and finally that day came. To play as each character is truly fun as it is to test out there class of the enemy through out each mission. Down falls of the game is that the controls are clunky... but that's only because the game was made for console. Not to worry though cause once you get your character/tank moving you'll get the hang of it. The art and texture are cool as well but it has some minor bugs like floating glasses on charcters who have them and floating armour as well. These bugs are noticable but doesn't draw your attention away from the game. The game as a whole is great and I'm loving it thus far.   I rate the game 8.5 with a few minor issues along the way but great story, character dialog and art."
"if you like xcom games, just don't miss this one"
"Features an army of actual people, a concentration camp, a military officer who factors goat droppings into his strategems, and a tiny flying pig for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed reason. Overall, an eclectic, yet thoroughly solid TBS."
Good gameplay. but Can i change a difficult on story mode ?
A very good stratety and unique game from the PS3 comes to the PC. It's a good PC port.
Great Game
"I did not play this game when it first came out but now I wish I did. This game is BEAUTIFUL! Not just the art design, but the characters and the story, it's just perfect! The characters that you recruit for your army have their own voice actor and personality and back story. The combat system is well designed. Alot of care was put into this game and I LOVE IT! This is a must buy for tactical and strategy lovers, even if you don't like strategy you'll love it."
"Now that I've finally finished the story, I can finally review this game. Ypa. Probably my first semi-serious review too. Ypa.  This is the first JRPG I've ever finished, and it's worth every cent for me. Excellent port from PS3, and memorable characters and story. The gameplay is fun, but getting A-ranks is hard, but not needed when you're just playing through the game for the story. In fact, I recommend not to grind for A-ranks during first play through, to get used to the feel of the game.   You could always grind funds through skirimishes and advanced tactics challenges anyway :P  . The game can be played depending on the level of challenge you want, ranging from sweatygalliantowel.jpg inducing challenge playthrough to walk in the cake park playthroughs due to weapons you can get in the DLC challenges, which is nice.  The story may be cliche at times, but nonetheless I've found it extremely fun. The scenario ranges from oh so very happy to gritty and bleak to heart attack inducing HNNNNNGGGGH. There are some forced plots like medics apparently not existing in the story but is always there in the game, but overall, quite a decent plot.  The art style is fun, the CANVAS engine gives the game a unique look. The various sound effects coming from weapons, tanks, and explosions gives a feel of playing an animated manga visual novel with a watercolor painting artstyle. While the manga-esque artstyle is a nice treat, the weapon design is also great, as expected from Raita. I've spent as much time playing the game viewing the weapons and figuring the design basis and how it would likely function in real life.  The soundtrack is awesome. Personally, one of the things that bring momentum to my gaming is the soundtrack and Valkyria Chronicle's soundtrack does not disappoint. The wide range of BGM, ranging from solemn to everyday life to the high paced 'destroy that huge tank with this rifle or else Gallia will be kaput' gives off that visual novel feel. The game also contains both the original Japanese audio AND the English dub, which is nice. Though the in game subtitles are based on the English dub, so some of the lines in Japanese don't exactly correspond to the lines in the subtitles (  like Welkin saying 'Alicia' translated as 'Is that so'  ).  There are some bugs, like some crashes (usually on closing the game) or the 'falling through the ground' bug (ruins some flanking maneuver) I've seen multiple times, and some glitchy controls like epileptic tanks, but other than that, the game is perfectly playable.  Pros:   Catchy artstyle   Fun gameplay   Interesting story   DUAL AUDIO, keeps both original Japanese and the English dub   Tanks   Moe girls driving tanks     In game lolis. Does... does this count as warcrimes?    Cons   Some bugs   Controls can be very glitchy at times (especially when driving tanks)   Very, very punishing A-rank requirements  Overall verdict: As a friend of mine says, 1935/10 Anime X-Com gave me PTSD and feels. And HNNNNNGGGGGGH  "
"I'm recommending this game, however VC isn't flawless. So I'm going to lay out all the little problems and if they're deal breakers then maybe you'll want to pick something else. If you're fine with them, then buy this game right away.  First off, the biggest issue is this game is VERY unintuitive early on. Expect to learn all the little aspects of the game and the various quirks you're required to exploit to get to the end.  First is intercepting fire. When you're controlling a single unit enemy units will fire at you when you're in range of their guns. Every bullet will hit you, and do a lot of damage. By the time intercepting fire has gone off you'll already be dead unless you gave your unit a defense order, or the unit has activated a defensive potential (special abilities). This is really jarring early on because you're expecting a turn-based strategy game. Intercepting fire is really a mechanic that's there to mitigate you just running through the enemy and taking their bases. A mechanic that becomes useless halfway through the game when you can load up one unit with defense orders and have her win matches in the first turn anyway.  Next is the AI. It's dumb as rocks. The AI will always make the same choices on every turn in every mission, which really cuts down on the replayability. Because the AI is as dumb as a wet towel the game has to compensate through nonsensical tactics. For instance, the enemy will always know how far away you are, how effective your weapons are, how effective its weapons are, and how powerful its armor is as well as its speed. Because of that, enemy units will run straight into your intercepting fire, then throw off a grenade and decimate your forces in one turn. Meanwhile, you won't know any of that information. Meaning players either must inch along slowly before making a huge rush at the enemy and hope to do enough damage to turn the tides, or waste control points having units run into danger only for the gun to misfire, or to come up short on movement, or any number of other reasons you'd have no knowledge of beforehand.  One last oddity is the best strategy is NOT to take as many units as possible. Instead, you can win most maps by taking the three main characters (Alicia, Rosie and Largo) and then load Alicia up with defensive buffs and have her just walk her way to victory in one turn. This is because you get extra CP for every major character. Even if you don't resort to cheesy tactics you can go the entire game without fielding half of your squad.  Next is the menu system. People have complained about no auto-saves, but I had no problem. The game is very slow though, every menu seems to have another menu, and going to different places is an excuse for the game to have some NPC greet you with a line of dialogue. I just want to buy tank parts, why does the dopey engineer NPC need to greet me every time I just want to buy some tank treads?  The soundtrack is good, and hands down ripped off of any project Yasumi Matsuno (Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy Tactics, Vagrant Story) has worked on. You can add all of those soundtracks together, set the playlist on random, and you wouldn't be able to tell Valkyria Chronicle songs from Final Fantasy Tactics, and vice-versa. That isn't a bad thing, but it shows what Sega was aiming for.  Of course, I wouldn't expect a Yasumi Matsuno storyline either. The game is very very very anime. The characters aren't dislikable, per-se. They're nice enough. And the writers kind of have a few arcs for some of the characters, but there's not enough to really care about them as much as Sega seems to think we should care about them. Their stories aren't all that compelling or original either. Overall, painless but not amazing. Just enough to get you through without bothering you.  The biggest issue is the game could've been a lot better. A lot-lot better, but it suffers from, I guess, the developers getting too into the game and not taking a moment to step back and really look at the big picture. About how all the pieces fit together, and about how other tactics games use their mechanics. So it sort of flails at a couple things other games have (cover based shooting, squad tactics, turn-based movement, etc) and throws it all against the wall to see if anything sticks.  Again, NOT a bad game. And if you're ok with the nitpicking above then by all means, BUY THIS GAME!"
"Recommended if you like JRPG, animes, tanks and hate nazis."
"I got Valkyria after I saw OddOne stream it on twitch, it looked like fun. I was not dissapointed"
"I first enyojed Valkyria Chronicles as one of my first games on my PS3, which feels ages ago. At that point of time, it was a rare treat, and I can tell you that I was more than suprised to find it on steam so long after its initial launch on the PS3. A no-brainer for me to buy this one. The story is more than captivating - I know some people find it full of cliches, but I really enjoy the way this game tells its story, as well as the way you engage with the characters. Find it today as captivating as it was when playing first on PS3. I personally like the graphics style - it most certainly is not one of the most high-def one, but the style (fear I am repating myself ;-) )"
"LOVED this game for PS3, proud to own it on Steam as well. I'm bowled over by the utter beauty of this port. Great controls, translates to mouse and keyboard perfectly. Just perfectly. Looks gorgeous at 1440p @ 60Hz! Good job, Sega, on a job well done. Turn-based squad tactics game with snipers, tanks, and rocket launchers? Yes, please!"
This is what The Bureau: XCOM Declasified should have been. With more aliens. And less anime-senpai thingie.
First time reviewing a game for me.  Honestly this is a top notch game compare to a lot of unfinished crap that's out there.  The game is very well polished and the story is interesting. The two main character are a little cheezy but the quality of the production more than make up for this.  The only real downside is the lack of dept on the RPG side. You only raise classes as a whole (like train your sniper from lvl 2 to lvl 3) and chose their weapon.   Still a solid buy IMHO
Sucks my precious 40+ hours in 10 days! Hate it so much!!
"Playing again on pc for its awesomeness, Vroom ratatatata 10/10"
20/10 'Hi I'm Ted!' -IGN
"Valkyria Chronicles offers players gameplay opportunities I have never found in other games. Today I ordered a 12 year old girl to shoot a man point blank in the back of the head, which she did. She then celebrated with a girlish giggle. Also, I'm exploiting a 15 year old girl's unrequited infatuation with my squad's female corporal, in order to benefit from their shared combat bonuses."
"It's a good PC port for Japan, gives you all the options you need.  This is a really good turnbased strategy title. Coming from someone who doesn't like turnbased strategy. The RPG elements are so light you won't even know they're there. It puts a heavily emphasis on story and characters though.  The story is a rather cutesy anime type of deal heavily inspired by ww2. You can change the language to Japanese because the English dub is mediocre at best. Also they repeat themselves a lot in game. So listening to Japanese repetition isn't nearly as bad.  The gameplay is fun. It keeps you guessing what's around each corner. While it has a bit of difficulty so you might find yourself retrying certain levels. Overall it's a good game that leaves you satisfied when you're finished playing."
"What can I say that you can't already read in all the overwhelmingly positive reviews helpful users have already posted? This game was one of my faves from the PS3/360 era, and I can't recommend it enough. It requires very little spec wise yet thanks to the Canvas engine it looks fantastic. I'm still shocked I can run this almost flawlessly on my Intel HD 4000 laptop! Portable Valkyria Chronicles yo! (And yes, I am aware and I own VC2 on Vita. Portable VC1, aight?).  Mainly, the reason for me posting this review is simply to thank Sega for bringing it to Steam. Again, this game was the reason I kept my PS3 for as long as I did, and now it's nice and safely in my Steam collection while I upgrade my console hardware. Now I have easy access to it, I gurantee this game will be replayed to death.  I would like to comment on the keyboard and mouse controls, but honestly, I wanted it to be as close to the PS3 version as possible... so I play it with my 360 controller. Yay irony!"
Valkyria Chronicles is exactly how I remember. An amazing game in both beauty of graphics and gameplay.
If you enjoy XCOM or Wasteland 2 and also enjoy watching anime/visual novels. Play this. Kinda niche game but quite enjoyable. Works well with Keyboard/Mouse being a console port. One con is the reward system is set to make you go as fast as possible disreguarding your troops for completing the goal turns faster. Players of XCOM will find this a hard change to get used to. 8/10 Game.
"In a strange twist, I'd watched the Valkryia Chronicles anime before I had the pleasure of playing this on steam. It was just as, if not more, enjoyable playing it than watching it. And that says a lot. The anime is one of my favorites.  Let me be concise - if you like strategy/tactics, excellent writing, excellent voice acting, and a damn solid game, then you need to buy this. if you like/love anime as I do, then it's a no-brainer.  "
"Best game i have in a long time. This game will make you laugh, cry, rage and warm your heart. Never have i been so pull into a game as mush as this one."
"10/10 Makes you feel like the worst squad leader in history. Plus, I got a 16 year old killed by being cross-mapped by a tank.  Would cry again. Loved it."
Great game if you prefer strategy and story above graphic.  10/10
"It's like Chess, but with guns. 8/8 m8 - IGN"
"Breathtaking in scope but exacting and detailed in narrative and playstyle. Against a backdrop of a fictionalised World War Valkyria Chronicles marries intuitive and very challenging tactical combat with a very human narrative with characters you won't be able to resist rooting for. Also incredibly brave in the decision to tackle the subject of racism, prejudice, and concentration camps head-on, rather than skirting around the issues.  Can't recommend it enough, it'll draw you in and won't let go until the gripping conclusion."
"This game is bascally Anime WW2(ish) XCOM. It has good story (It does has a little bit of plot holes that needs more polishing.) It has fantastic Gameplay. Just like any tactical game you did need to have some foresight to plan out a good assault. The biggest difference with XCOM is that in Valkyria Chronicles when you select an units you would zoom into 3rd person view to control it. Also exploring the map are much more forgivable than XCOM because you can move you units multiple times with decresing moving distance for each consective usage. In XCOM each units can only move a set distance each turns, and if a soilder ended up in a bad spot like running into a group of enemy. If other soilders can't quickly back it up in the same turn the scouting soilder can be easily killed in the next enemy's turn unless you have some end-game tech like cloaking, so scouting in XCOM is quite dangerous. In order to compensate the great advantage of moving a single unit multiple times, All of the enemy units are basically always on overwatch, and will fire intercepting shot at your units when you move in range, so you still can't run in to an enemy base without taking any damage.  In Valkyria Chronicles in order to achieve better score you need to use as few turns as possible. In XCOM in order to win a battle with minimal casualty in higher diffculty you need to proceed as cautious as possible. For this reason I think Valkyria Chronicles is a faster pasing game; However, with the freedom of the movement in your disposal there are certain features you can exploited to achieve much easier winning such as Orders combining with Scout rush (especially with Alicia.), but at the end of the day, Using it dose make you feel quite powerful and smart, and you also have the chooices of not using it.  I heard the class system are more complex in its sequels. I hope Sega can remake VC2 and VC3 psp game in to PC game, or maybe release more DLC for this game to bring more features in."
this game is beautifull and i know i have only 23 minutes of game time when i write this but i already love it and cant wait to continue playing it. 10/10
Alternative history?..sign me up. It is a well told story and extremely fun and addictive and it has just benn shy of 2hours of game play. Do yourself a favor and pick it up (Treat yourself )
"As a man who likes anime and strategy, as well as RPG and taking turns. I think this is a solid 10/10, good buy, good eats. Also, Alicia is an amazing baker."
"Fantastic tactical RPG with a brilliant battle system and an engrossing WW2-inspired story. Also an EXCELLENT PC port with support for high resolutions (up to 4k), 120hz refresh rate, and reasonable (albeit imperfect) keyboard/mouse support. This is the real deal!"
Great game that I haven't played in awhile. I hope the other to games come out also.
"Simply a great game.  Great story, anime-like cel-shaded graphics, all DLCs included, rpg and strategy, everything one could desire.  Possibly the best game I played this year, one of the best I ever played."
"Well, what to say, really, Valkyria Chronicles was my favorite game for long, long time, ever since I played it for first time on PS3, and from that time I finished it many times, whole Valkyria Chonicles series is, in my opinion, one of best JRPG series that were ever made, it is sad that 2 sequels were done for PSP and not for PS3 But back to Valkyria Chronicles, when I saw that it is going to be relased on PC I was kinda surprised, never thought this will happen and it is nice surprise to be honest, port from PS3 is really nice, even if it can get bit weird to play with keyboard or mouse, you can easily buy gamepad and there is no problem, even without it it is really easily playable though, which surprised me after few... Not so great ports I've recently seen  Valkyria Chronicles is my favorite JRPG if not game in whole, I really like this game and I kinda grew up on it, so I can be kinda.... Inaccurate, but I think this game for sure is worth it price and this is great chance for those who prefer PC over consoles to try one of greatest, if not the greatest, tactical JRPG ever made  Story - 9/10 - As story stands, Valkyria Chronicles is very solid and have nice plot twists that often surprise you, but there are some flaws in it too, for those who know game and saw anime adaptation, they probably know what I mean, game simply deal with few situations bit... Weird... Characters - 10/10 - For characters I can't have anything, basicly, they are perfect, I think at least, each one of them is somehow alive and even if your squad members 'don't play that big of a role' they feel alive too, this is done even better in VC2 where you have missions for each character, for VC, you can watch anime, squad members are shown in way better light there Graphics - 10/10 - One of main selling point for Valkyria Chronicle as lot of people say, VC was my first game where I've seen this sort of graphic and it was great to see Music - 9/10 - I'm not that hard to impress when it comes to music, I listen to lot of genres but in VC I really loved and will always love this beautiful Soundtrack, what is reason why I didn't gave 10... Well, basicly, game doesn't have 'that many' songs and it can get bit dull after some time, still music itself is really nice Gameplay - 9/10 - As far as gameplay goes I am bit more different player than this game have, I love RPG games and JRPG especially, finished lot of them and am still playing whenever I have bit of time, gameplay side of VC is really well done, battle system is great and it is easy to make, sometimes RnG can kinda screw you over but that is RnG in nutshell, my main complaint, even if it probably doesn't even belong that much in here, is that for 100% completion of game you need to kill your soldiers, or well, let them die, so you get trophies or medals and such, taht is one big thing that always annoyed me in VC and thus reason why I never finished it for '100%'  I could recomend this game to anyone that likes JRPG or tactical RPG in general, both gameplay side and story side of this game is really well made and people can for sure enjoy i if they like this type of game, it for sure isn't some Hack'n slash type of game like Dynasty Warriors, but you don't really expect that from an tactical JRPG, right?"
"I'm really glad that SEGA ports it one on PC.  It is a fun TBS and one of my favorite game on PS3. I prefer keyboard/mouse over the PS3 controler too. I hope they will do the same for VC2 &amp; 3.  If you love strategy games and you have never tried it, you must click on the 'Add to Cart'. This game is a classic."
Can put Vyse and Aika from Skies of Arcadia in your party 10/10
"Its a barebones port but those bones are (mostly) extremely solid. Sega continues recreates the legacy of the console version by making the UI unintuitive as hell and the save screen looks like the ps3 one.  The game supports an unlocked framerate and up to 4k resolution but the textures haven't scaled accordingly, nevertheless this isnt a big problem thanks to the anime/manga inspired artstyle which still looks fairly solid. This seems to run extremely well at 1080p on my Phenom II 965 x4 and Radeon HD 5870 despite it being a good few years old at this point.  Unfortunately there is no AA on ingame character models so when you look at units they can appear jagged on the edges, the higher your resolution makes this less noticable as it was on the ps3 but it is still present.  The game itself conveys an excellent story with some extremely fun turn-based strategy, the aesthetic is inspired with a very pleasing blend of World War 2 era Europe and a tint of Ancient magic/technology that becomes more prominent with the Valkyrur as the plot pushes forward.  The turn based combat has one problem however but this is much more prominant in the lategame and with hindsight so it doesn't spoil the experience as bad as it could have, Orders are overpowered.  Once you attach an Awaken Potential order to a unit which is fairly well levelled, they can sometimes win entire levels by themselves, I had Alicia Belting across open-ground with unlocked Double Movement and Resist crossfire, running through machinegun fire from tanks, entrenched shocktroopers and concrete bunkers to hurl a grenade at the enemy outpost and take the homebase... in 1 turn.  Irregardless, this game is overall still as excellent as it was before."
I remember loving this game so much on the PS3 and it turns out that my feelings were right. This game is just as good on PC if not better. The only issue that I have heard of is the Keyboard and Mouse controls. This is not an issue if you have a controller so this did not effect me. In the end I VERY HIGHLY recommend this game.
"Absolutly stunning port! I had no idea it was even coming to PC until a week before release. I loved this game when it first came out on ps3 and i still love it now.   Controller support is perfect, price is beyonf good ands it happens to be a far more stable than any other port that I've had on steam before,  Plenty of options in the menu's that make it feel like it was ported with love (Though admitedly navigating the many options does get a bit teious even though most will only do it once or twice.) The best thing? Options for both english and Japanese VA's  Then I find out I comes with all the DLC for free? Gods if even one of the main user tags for this game is something you like then pick this game up and just try it. Good job Sega now get to work porting the sequels most of us never got to play!"
Awesome game! Graphics and controls are really good to be a port so 10/10. Sega is doing the right things lately.
The basic game is fun and enjoyable. It is not overly complex with it's progression system of the characters. That could be a positive or negative mark depending on the person.   It is a port so it does have minor issues. No mouse support except for the buttons in menus. The tank sometimes goes ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when controlling it mainly when backing up. It maybe a slight issue of user error but it could have been improved.   I hope the other two games get ported which maybe less likely due to being PSP games.
"Well i've beaten both vc 1 and 2 on PS3 and PSV(psp port), respectively and am what you might call a hardcore fan of the series.   And It's justified since VC is such a solidly built Strategy rpg, However on PC, it's buggy. Especially the tanks. It didn't bother me too much since the first thing i did was get myself a ruhm(beat in her blue flame DLC with A rank), but when i got to mission 3, edelweiss would get stuck on nothing. and when stuck it would randomly turnaround, draining AP much faster than any tank possibly ever could. Tanks in general are unwieldy and turn awkwardly at the wrong times.   Seriously needs a patch update."
"amazing game. i really wish there was other games that played like this one. also if youre a big fan of anime, this will appeal to you. though i will say the music is a little lacking in my opinion."
"I declared this to be my favorite game ever back when it first came out for the PS3. Then my PS3 broke and I couldn't play it anymore. Went like 7 years without playing it. Fast forward to just a few days ago when I saw that Steam had a PC port on sale for preorder. I cried. I bought it. I waited. I started it on Nov. 11, when it came out.. The first scene with Welkin approacing Bruhl happened and he said, 'I haven't been down this road in years. It really hasn't changed very much.' I cried so hard. I am a man.  In short, 11/10, would cry again."
Band of Anime Brothers
my favourite PS3 game has come to PC i can enjoy this game in glorious 144hz 1440p.  at 20$ your getting a real deal an awesome Tactical Turn Based Classic and ALL of its DLC think of fire emblem meets band of brothers. i would have dropped triple its price just for the game alone 
"Awesome game and fantastic port, and it's cheap as hell too."
"Everything it does, it does well. The graphics still look nice today, the story is interesting and well told, the characters are likeable and the gameplay is strategical and varied. The pacing is a little slow and you'll be spending a lot of time watching cutscenes, many of which are more slice-of-life than integral to the plot, though they're usually optional. There's replayability given both by the ranking system as well as the various possibilties of squad composition, including what classes you use, which individuals you use based on their perks (things like working better in desert environments because they grew up in one) and shortcomings (things like being allergic to pollen so losing HP slowly in pollen-rich areas) and how well they work together based on friendships and even sexual attraction and racism (some people hate being around Darcsens, a minority in this setting).  The port is good, various graphics options although nothing too advanced, and you can uncap the framerate from 30 - something many ports seem to neglect until people start complaining about it. I've had no crashes or performance issues yet apart from the fact it tends to crash on exit, but that's not really a problem. Saving and loading is instant and failure at a mission leads to the chance to immediately retry it from the start. You can also save during missions. While there's plenty of challenge here, it's not of the frustrating sort. There's also a NG+ option.  Highly recommended even if you don't normally enjoy the anime aesthetic, even more so if you do."
"I loved the game on the PS3, and highly recommend this port for the PC."
"Advance Wars: Days of Ruin and XCOM had a child. Remove Aliens and put in Imp scum and you have a 10/10 strategy game. GALLIA, TO ARMS."
"LET ME SKIP THESE CUTSCENES, YOU ANIME SOBs  Other than that fantastic strategy game, highly worth your time"
Nice game
"Honestly I don't even know what to say that would sum up how amazing this game is better than any of the top reviews. It was a fantastic game on PS3, and it's still fantastic all these years later on PC. This game has aged better than...... grape juice.  It comes with all the previously released DLC and is already significantly cheaper than buying the game was for PS3 originally, so I'd say it's a really great deal. The story is relatively classic in the overarching plot, but the heartfelt characters, unique storytelling, and the mixture of realism and fantasy really makes it fresh and engaging. Meanwhile, the gameplay IS strategic but doesn't have as much of the 'chess game' feel of the standard strategy tile/grid set up, giving you a little bit more action by giving you third person partially-real time control of each character one by one. They're integrated together really well, and make both planning and taking action quite enjoyable, although sometimes (especially in the first few maps) you may just find yourself charging the line instead of 'strategizing' in order to get the best grade. This proves a lot less true as you progress in the game though, so that may just be from my viewpoint of someone who's played the game several times.  (And remember to check your roster once in a while for new characters to enlist!)"
Best strategy game ever from the last decade!
"One of the best games i've gotten in a while. Backstories on each soldier is cool, makes you actually care about who you put in and takes a lot more strategy than you would think. Amazing game, cool art style, awesome gameplay."
"The game overall is great for anime lovers and those who love a good strategy game, a little too cute at times considering this story is about a fantasy version of WW2, and i almost died laughing when one character sees like 5 civilians gunned down and she says...'tensions are high with the empire'........T_T rly? THIS IS ALL OUT WAR!!!!"
"9/10  Valkyria Chronicles is one of my favorite Rpgs of all time. It boasts an amazing story, impressive visuals, and unique and engaging combat.  The steam version includes all 4 of the dlc's and achievments right out of the box, which the ps3 version lacked.   It is a must play for JRPG fans. There is no other game like it."
(+++) A really great game. A rarity like old X-COM or Battle Isle series. (++) Pretty smart and unpredictable AI. (++) Encourages to explore battlefield for hiddden units. (+) Allows grinding and playing at one own pace. (++) Excellent story and dialogues with great original voice acting. (lol) Can't jump over the fence :p P.S. I think best to watch anime adaptation first.
"HAven't finished the game yet, but I'm having a lot of fun with it.  Won't go other details much except port, many reviews out there, old game, new port to PC.  Mostly things work fine, re-mappable keys, resolution options, fps tied to refresh rate, all good.  Mostly things control just fine with keyboard, game is totally playable. Mouse works when aiming guns/as camera when in action mode, and in tactics phase when selecting which unit to move (altought a bit sluggish there), all nice.  But, tank controls are really janky at times, and no mouse driven menus at all. Mouse support is nice where I mentioned it working, elsewhere it is lacking totally. There really is no excuse to not have mouse controls in menus and such, and that would make things so much more fluid. Also UI at times is really not great, designed for PS3 so that was to be expected tought.  So, quite good, but not amazing port as some people state here. Game is damn fun tought, not a big fan of anime myself, but I have to admit this game has weird charm in it."
"Ive played very little of this game and i am instantly hooked! It hits almost all the right chords, and even a few unique ones not felt before. I really hope the rest of the series comes to PC  I am totaly new to these games and...i love it already!   If you like RPG's and anime....BUY THIS."
when i found out this game was coming out on steam i ♥♥♥♥ so many bricks i was able to build myself a new house
"8 Years ago, i migrated from consoles to PC, and while i don't regret this, i have to say that i really missed some J-games, and i can only thank Sega for bringing this Gem of a game to Steam.  Amazing art, very good combat and a very well made port.    PS: There are also characters from Skies of Arcadia, what else could i say????"
"A classic wargame that combines real-time and turn-based gameplay, married with a distinct anime visual design, fantastic voice acting, and wartime love story.  I had watched the anime a few years ago, but the game escaped my must-play list despite the accolades. I was pleased to see how closely the anime had followed the game, and the play through doubled as a re-watch.   It's a fluffy and sweet game for the majority, with a few heartbreaking story twists to remind you that war/racism are awful. As a side note, the gentle hearted main characters have no problem throwing down when it comes to fighting; they only seem to have problems with fighting a war dishonorably. It's an odd mixed message.  The tactical component of the game is a command point system where you spend points to activate your units in any order and with diminishing returns for re-activing the same units repeatedly. There are infantry and tank unit classes of various kinds which interact in a rock-paper-scissors style. Customization comes from weapon loadout and special abilities that have a chance to trigger when certain conditions are met.   Overall the missions are fun and carry unique challenges and set pieces, often foregoing or delaying details and just leaving you to figure out how to win.  The randomly triggering unit special abilities failed to impress me, making missions chaotically harder or easier thanks to RNG. There are ways to min/max these abilities, but I found it more a waste of time for how often the correct ability would trigger. The unit/environment hit boxes/clipping made me rage a few time as I was forced to replay a large number of turns due to invisible walls and invincible terrain - this is a major pet peeve of mine, but your mileage may vary.  8.5/10"
"I bought this game some time ago for the PS3. Unfortunately, it still sits in my pile of shame even today (due to Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw ragging on it as he does everything). Buying this for the PC should be a waste of money on my part, but hey. Master race, amirite? But I'm glad I did, because it's the first game I've encountered in a very long time that I've been determined to see to the end.....   PROS  *Storytelling is the best I've seen in an RPG for awhile, and in a few ways can even hold up against Bioware's stuff. While almost every other RPG has you saving the world from an apocalipstickal threat, It's honestly refreshing to see a story about a small nation fighting for its sovereignty in an alternate WW2 setting.Character development, while obviously not as deep as that found in a bioware game, has been done exceptionally well for a J-RPG. Of a particular note is the main protagonist, Welkin Gunther. Unlike most protagonists in these games, Welks doesn't have your typical grimdark edgy chracter flaws, yet at the same time he doesn't come across as being a complete 'Mary Sue' character. I feel that often, the success of story driven games live and die on the personality of the main guy/girl. The fact that Welks is a genuinely likeable bro works in the game's favour.  *When you think of turn based RPG's with guns, XCOM will be the first thing that comes to mind. This game is nothing like XCOM. Not even close. In my opinion if it bares any kind of resemblance to something else, for me it would be a forgotten gem from the PS1 era known as Hogs of War. But regardless of what it resembles, it plays fluidly. Aided by 60fps, the gameplay is addictive, and strikes that perfect balance between streamlined simplicity, and involved complexity. This extends out to level advancement and weapon development as well, where you can level up entire classes instead of individual characters. It streamlines alot of the tedium found in games like XCOM, without going so far as to turn it into baby's first RPG. Again: Balance.  CONS  *While the character development is great, I wanted to see more of it amongst the sub characters in your squad. It would've been cool to have these characters develop relationships and sub-stories depending on who you took to battle with you. There would have been more of a reason to care about these guys, and as it stands, I feel that this was a missed opportunity.  *Difficulty spikes. You'll find the first handful of missions fairly easy to breeze through, but very suddenly, you'll hit a metaphorical brick wall(without directly revealing any spoilers, it's the first time you meet Selvaria on the battlefield). What makes this even worse(or better?) is that due the game's other overwhelmingly positive traits, you will feel compelled to persevere. Put it this way: I dropped 4 hours into a single mission. There are whole games that can be finished quicker.   On the whole though, Valkyria Chronicles is a great turn based tactical RPG that dares to be just alittle bit different. If you like turn based strategy, WW2 era games, and don't mind a bit of kawaii mixed in, then this is a game for you!  Thanks Sega. You guys are alright(sometimes)."
"I skipped the PS3 and decided instead to go with an Xbox 360, but if there was ever one game that would of made me go for the PS3 this would of been it. Now that i've been able to play it I found that I love the story and game play. I would reccomend it whole heartily. But at the same time there were only really two bugs I've found with the game.  First off is the tank driving which is extremly buggy. A guide on how to drive it in game would of been appreciated, especially in relation to how the mouse moves. The other game breaking bug in one of the last levels that features you trying to deliver a train of explosives to an enemy base. When you try to move your troops onto the ladders by the gatling towers they 'fall through' the world.   Despite the flaws the game is a tactically challenging experience that is well worth the hours put into it. I have not had this much fun with a game since I played Resident Evil 4 on the Game Cube. I look forward to replaying it again and hopefully have it so all my troops make it out of this war alive."
Shot a tank in the ♥♥♥ and it blew up.
never ever step within a spot light
I like this anime story also this game :)
"A truly amazing game. I haven't managed to get through its entirety but I already love the story and the characters.  The game is full of cutscenes, with at least 70-80% of the actual game being you just sitting back and watching some plot build up. Essentially, VC is a TV show where you do the action scenes. FIghts are turn based and can take up to an hour to complete, so make sure you have time to spare. The story centers around your squadron and its core group which are featured in the cutscenes and it is here where you fall in love with the characters and their personalities. After only a couple hours, you notice how your squadmates develop and how as a collective you get closer with each other. As a result, when squadmates die, you really feel for them and may tear up as well. Moreover, the VC has plenty of other scenes where you just start to cry from how touching it all is. Think Valiant Hearts but you cry tears of joy.   Controls can be a little confusing, but it is not that big of deal.  All in all, I HIGHLY reccommend this game. Get ready for a long haul as the story lasts for ~55 hours. It's definitely one of my favorite games of all time and I expect to playthrough the story at least once more. Plus they made an anime based on the game. So if you love the game, put the anime on your to do list once you complete the story."

"A lot of fun, one of the best turnbased strategies I've played. Reminds me of the original Final Fantasy Tactics in the best ways."
"Overall impression: A well done, extremely challenging game that will appeal to a broad audience due to its mix of multiple genres such as JRPGs, FPSs, and tactical strategy.  Aesthetics: Good graphics for its time. A very nice art style mixing traditional Japanese anime and vibrant water colors.   Performance: I personally didn't have any significant problems with stability except for one bug where one of my characters dropped out of the bottom of the enviroment on a level and couldn't be used anymore on that level. Since it is a PC port, however, your milage may vary and thus caveat emptor applies here.  Gameplay: I gotta say when it comes to video games the Japanese don't screw around. This game was very, very difficult. The enemy AI isn't necessarily the smartest, but they do have some significant advantages over you. For starters they usually greatly outnumber you. This normally wouldn't be a problem, except that they rarely miss their shots, while your soldiers will miss critical shots left and right. This is compounded by the fact that sometimes the enemy will just completely dodge your attacks. This is honestly the source of most of the frustration in the game, along with some aspects (namely the interception fire rules) that are blatantly skewed in favor of the enemy AI, and the long time investments (up to 2 hours) each battle takes. That being said it is not necessarily unfair; you just have to be smart about your plays. It is a game that rewards skill and time invested in learning its systems.  Story: If you were afraid that because of the anime art style it would mean a generic anime story, then I am happy to inform you that your fears are not warrented. The story is quite good, with plenty of character development, well constructed dialogue, and memorable scenes. It definitely makes up for the sometimes frustrating level of difficulty."
"This game has a story and setting the quality of a good Final Fantasy game, and that says a lot. Characters are properly developed and despite the fact that I got stuck at a mission and retried it over 5 times (until I realized I was thinking too difficult), I kept trying solely for the reason of wanting to experience the rest of the story. On top of that, the sketchiness of the art style really makes for an appealing look during both cinematics and gameplay.  A highly recommendable game for any fan of either the RPG or TBS genre. 9/10"
This is more of a recommended thing to do rather than a review.  Go watch the anime if you want to have a more realized story.
"A perfect mix of 3rd person shooting and military turn based combat. It's challenging and it has a great story with great character development. It suffers from some little problems that could have been easily fixed that make the game a little bit annoying sometimes : - you cannot restart, you have to die - bad briefing, you have no clue where the enemies are and where are the zones to conquer (sometimes you have to start the mission just to check the map and restart it to play it properly) - you cannot skip the enemy turn and this is annoying since some of the missions are really long  Nevertheless it's a really good game that will test your strategic abilities, almost every mission can be done in many different ways using different tactics, and this makes the game really fun. The visual art is amazing and it has a good soundtrack."
"Lets be clear: this is a Japenese game. I say this because it really does feel like nothing else in my Library.  For example, you litterally have to watch an anime episode, (though much shorter) before you can do the missions.  another thing that really struck me about how this is japenese only struck me after i had almost beaten it. It's not a tactical game like X-Com, it's more about what score you get in a level, the challenge is not 'beat the enemy stay alive' it's 'beat teh enemy, to get teh best score you can' which I highly recomend but cause other wise it does feel a touch easy, unless you takeing the risks you need to get an A rank in every mission.  Do i recomend it? yes , the story is very good and the game play is nice and become 'very nice' once you manage to get you head in the score attack mindset."
"TLDR: when this game is good, it's good, but when it's bad, it's frustratingly bad.  First, the stuff I like.  The visuals are great. The interwar aesthetic for infantry is wonderful. The characters are distinctive with personalities and hopes and dreams and you really don't want them to die (even the ones with the Jew Hater - er, Darcsen Hater - potential). The combat engine is unique, combining turn based tactics with third person shooter in a way that I liked a lot. Music is good too, for people who are about that. It's got a solid plotline overall; it's not without its problems, but there's definitely some emotional moments here and there.  So on the the bad stuff.  My biggest complaint, by far is this: I've seen the assessment that it's billed as a turn-based tactics game when it's really more like a puzzle game, and I'd have to agree with this assessment. Contrast XCOM, where you win by havng good fundamental grasp of tactics - move the squad together so that they can always support each other, get in cover, sometimes it's worth it to hunker down instead of take a bad shot or be on overwatch, etc). You don't always know what missions will throw at you, but as long as you have decent fundamentals, you won't do too poorly. VC is...not like that. Each map is designed like a puzzle with an optimal solution to A-rank (which usually ends up being 'stick a defense order on a Scout or, later, awaken Alicia's potential and run them to capture the enemy base camp for the win) in defiance of all military common sense (don't deploy with a full squad, so you don't have to use an action point to retreat someone when you capture a base; always deploy Rosie and Largo for the extra action points, etc). For the most part, you don't win missions by having scouts run up to recon, and then having snipers clear as many guys as possible, and then having shocktroopers move up to kill the ones they can't, and then possibly moving up a lancer to take any tanks. No, you win by ignoring most of the enemies on the map so you can clear it in as few turns as possible to get a high rank. Now, I understand that there are, at times, valid military necessity to beelining for the objective instead of killing everything...but it's a problem when most missions require this. And the ones that don't...tend to blindside you with things you could not possibly have predicted enough to prepare for. Again, I understand these things happen in war sometimes. But it's poor game design when beating the mission more or less requires you to know what's going to happen. It defeats the idea somewhat of finding an unorthodox strategy to win the battle when the map is designed such that this strategy is the only one that's useful. You're not left with the feeling you did better than you could have, instead you only feel like you read the design team's mind. It's the difference between actually writing a good literary analysis of a work and getting an A on it, vs parroting what the professor says on your final paper and getting an A on it.  My secondary complaint feeds into the first: the deployment and command map isn't useful at all. There's not the option to browse the map and see where all the sandbags and cover and ladders and such are in the deployment stage, and both the deployment map and the command map lack the very important feature of telling you where the insurmountable waist-high ditches are. There are times where you will think you can cut across a particular pathway or climb up a ladder and then hit the enemy from the rear based on the map, only to find that slight elevation changes prevents you from doing so. This feeds into my previous beef - winning at this requires you to read the design team's mind and know what happens.  There's a couple of other things. The port isn't as polished as it could be, so you only select things on the menus screens via keyboard. Also, controlling the tank is *wonky* with keyboard and mouse. Computer will abuse its instantaneous reaction speed to shoot as many interception shots at you as it can, but will immediately enter firing mode once it gets hit by your own interception shots (enemies stop shooting once you're in firing mode to give you time to line up shots). The story's Aesops are a bit...off; there are characters the narrative tells you were bad and wrong except there was literally no other option at that point.  Bottom line, if you're in it for the tactics, play XCOM instead, as it's a lot more 'fair' about assessing your tactical prowess. If you want story, both games will work - the common complaint is that XCOM doesn't have story, but that's actually not true; in XCOM you create your own story of individual soldiers who had their moments of badassery and saved the day. No, where this game really shines is just a different overall experience compared to other games of the genre.  And it should be noted that as much as I hate the things I hate about this game, I still like it enough to go for a New Game Plus."
"One of the Best Story driven, tactical combat games, I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Everything about this game is well done, I find that the unique art work style really helps to bring the story to life and the music does an amazing job complimenting that with a varying degree of orchestral highs and lows. Over all a 10/10! The only thing they could do to improve in my eyes is include a copy of the anime series that was based on this game with purchase."
"A spectacular art driven strategy game set in a vivid fantasy world inspired by 1940's Europe. With endearing characters, traditional good vs evil plot, and an inspiring, symphonized sound score, Valkyria Chronicles makes a good argument for, 'games as an art form.' 10/10"
"In the same vain as portable games like Advance Wars, Valkyria Chronicles adds the element of third-person shooter to add to the interactive nature of squadron commander. Set in a richly illustrated and thought-out world, Valkyria Chronicles is certainly a must add for fans of strategy and anime alike.  However, the story for Valkyria Chronicles is like a tragic war film. It's wonderfully written, yet is also extremely heartbreaking. There's a lot of parallels to WWII, primarily the treatment of the Darcsens people whose subjugation is very much in the same manner that Nazi Germany treated Jews.  There's a lot of dark themes here and -- despite it's deceiving art-style -- I would not recommend this to children."
"An excellent buy, especially if on sale. Valkyria Chronicles is like the 3D games in the Worms series, but made a lot better. The characters and plot are interesting, and the art style is quite unique. The game mechanics and scoring system push you to explore multiple tactics, and beating a level after a lot of experimentation definitely feels rewarding. The only things that detract from the playing experience are having to sit through each enemy turn (at normal speed), a lack of optimization for mouse and keyboard, and not being able to create multiple saves. Overall though, Valkyria Chronicles is an impressive game that has a more than decent amount of gameplay time to it. Highly recommended!"
Excellent port of the ps3 version. Highly recommended!
"Simply fantastic game. The gameplay is mostly turn-based with a real-time 'intercept fire' mechanic where defending units will start firing on attacking units when they come within range. The combat is a little bit unusual in that units can be moved as many times as you want in a turn but they get a movement penalty each successive time you use them in a turn. It works pretty well but makes the combat slightly off-balance since the player will often abuse this by sending Scouts across the entire map or will fire with their Snipers 6 times in one turn but the AI will never really abuse this feature and rarely uses a unit more than twice in a turn even if that leave sthem at a huge disadvantage. Overall, though, the combat is amazing.  The story is equally good, as well. The cutscenes can be quite long between missions but they are broken up into bits so you can save and exit if something comes up. There were times I would open the game after the previous mission, watch some cutscenes, hit up headquarters to prep for battle and save and quit before starting the next mission. That's how long some cutscenes can be, lol. They're very well-done, though, so that's not a complaint.  Overall, I have a hard time finding any real flaws with this game. The porting was pretty minimal and the controls can take some getting used to but it runs really well. I highly recommend it if you enjoy turn-based strategy games. A must-own."
"Beautifully fictionalized alternate WWII plotline. Great characters and an amazing anime/manga art style. The hybridized turn-based/real time battle mechanics are wonderfully implemented! Great RPG and army building elements as well! Sega has done a great job of porting this PS3 title to the PC and the gamepad support is good, unlike other Sega ported titles (Binary Domain, I'm looking at you). This is an amazing game and well worth a purchase!"
Love this game! Support Dual Audio! &lt;3  
Amazing graffics. Great plot ( though kinda stolen from ww2) Characters have importance and its forgiving if you get them killed. well... as long as you can make it to them in 3 turns. Only issue is that it doesnt like to work well with a mouse. I gotta get myself an xbox controller to work it better. Besides teh slight controll interface issues. Great game.  9/10
XCOM for weeaboos 10/10
I love this game! I am so happy that they released this for pc! A game that other games should be rated agains!
The only issue I got with this game is its subtitles. Its f'ing terrible when you actually know what they're saying in Japanese. A fan-subbing group could have done a better job with them subtitles. Beside that its all good. An HD texture pack would have been nice but oh well that's too much to ask I guess. BTW just in case you were wondering the story is somewhat different than the anime. So its worth playing it just for the story even if you've watched the anime before.   8/10
Love this game console or PC.
"Simply put, Valkyria Chronicles is the best turn based game I've ever played. And I'm only 6 hours into the game as I am typing this. Before you begin a mission, you can decide what class of troops you want and where you would like to place them. Once that's done, you start the mission with a map displaying the location of all your troops and or tanks. You then select a unit to use and it goes into the third person shoulder mode you see in all the screenshots above and choose how to use the unit. I've never played a turn based game that let you actually control the units in the way this game has so I am pretty well having a blast. There's tons of other things that go into it (such as class types, personality traits, weapon/tank upgrades, and so on.)   The war going on in the game is obviously based around WW2 with refrences to a prior war much like WW1 common as well. In fact the wars are pretty much identical with the first war in the game focusing on trench warfare much like WW1. And it even comments about how tanks were designed to combat the trenches and were later improved to accomplish other tasks. And not that it really means anything but the main characters tank seems to be based off the Panzer IV the Germans had. Looking slightly similar in apperance especially when equipped with skirts. And just like the germans upgraded the Panzer IV to keep it on the frontlines, you upgrade the Edelweiss to keep it useful. Idk, I just thought it was cool cuz I am a tank guy.  Anyways I am getting off subject so I'll conclude with this: I do recommend the game if you like turn based strategy games. However, as others have said, it is very story heavy. There are quite a few cutscenes in between battles. I would call it 'playing an anime' but I like the story of video games so this is no problem for me personally.  "
"I loved this game and am Happy to see it on steam, but I am saddened that it keeps crashing when you go to book mode after leaving the HQ for the first time. Hope theres a quick fix to it so I can play this gem again"
"So far very fun, wish the sequels were tranlated. worth getting if you like anime style story telling."
"Whenever you think you won a battle, the game punches you right in the feels in the following scene.  10/10 would cry again   Only drawback: Has no multiplayer. MP would be perfect with this game."
A must play for any fans of the strategy genre.
"All was at peace in Ghallia, until the empire attacked."
always goes on sale for 10 dollars pick it up if you can really fun

"Very good game &amp; conversion!  I have already played the PS3 version and the PC version is exactly like it. Using the mouse is even a little more convenient than a controller.  Also, the game itself is just awesome and good value . If you enjoy a turn-based tactics game with lots of action and great storyline this game should be for you. The graphics are timeless and the game runs smooth even on older computers."
"Just as good as i remember, this game never gets old"
"Really nice, a very cool gameplay. For what i saw a really good story of war.The only thing that really grind my gears are the cut scenes, and how long they are. If you can hnadle the cut scenes, i really recommend."
"Just to make it easier for you to read and understand everything about the game in short words. Do you like anime RPG turn-based staregy games, with a very good way of narrating the story and with really fun gameplay? Then this is your game. After 30 hours of playing it on PC + over 45 hours on PS3 I must say this is the most fun turn-based strategy video game I have ever played so far. You can't compare it with other tittles, this one is one of its own.  The most thing you gonna love about it is the recruiting system, different soliders have different virtures (personalities/passive abilities) which gives you the chance of freely recruiting soliders getting them into battles and then deciding which is the best for which battle. Really interesting game mechanics, a smiple passive ability could save the whole battle.  Overall, the game is pretty enjoyable there is also a NG´+ system in the game which I highly recommend doing (very fun) you feel like a god in the early battles xD. Not to make it long, I highly recommend this game, I love it and will keep loving it! I'd give it 9/10, game is not perfect but it is complete!"
"This game is tough for those of us who are way too acustomed to western-style games, it's not so fast paced as I'd want it to be but it's still a great game, I have played enough to say it's an extremely fun and challenging game. The characters are a bit cheesy but they're fun, maybe this game is just worth playing for Jann Walker, one of the most hilarious character's I've ever seen in any game."
This game is great. A great story with great plot and great voice acting. I got it on sale. Well worth the mony. OIder game doesn't mean it is not good!
This game is worth every cent that you will pay for it! This game will make you think about every move that you will make. It is an excellent strategy game. It also has a story that will have you logging hours of gameplay. The best part of this game is that all of your soldiers have their own distinct personalities. I find myself nervous at the begining of every mission because I actually care about these characters and their wellbeing and dont want to lose them.
"If war is made up of long periods of boredom, punctuated by moments of sheer terror, then Valkyria Chronicles is similarly partitioned. Not by boredom and terror, but by story and gameplay, silliness and solemnity. Valkyria Chronicles is a JRPG, and it fully embraces that. It's full of cutscenes, expressive characters, and generally has an upbeat and cheerful sense of adventure. The main story is less about war, and more about love, and the ties that bind us. This surprised me, because I was expecting a more grounded story, based on the small amount of exposure I had to the game prior to playing it. I knew it was set in an allegorical universe based on World War Two, and the tone of the trailer and introductory cutscene seemed to indicate a place where history would be analyzed through the lens of the fantastical.  To be sure, there are some very serious concepts and historical events brought up. From concentration camps, to the cost to the human soul during wartime, to the morality of weapons of mass destruction, this game is about as shy in its utilization of allegory as C.S. Lewis. But those are placed directly alongside standard JRPG fare like fanservice beach parties and cute animal sidekicks, which makes it hard to give them the scrutiny they deserve. This disconnect can be very jarring.  The year is 1935, and Europa is entering its second continental war of the century. Fighting over a precious resource which is the backbone of industry, medicine, science, and the military, the Autocratic East Europan Imperial Alliance has instigated hostilities by crossing their border with the Atlantic Federation, an alliance of democracies in the West. Caught between them is the nation of Gallia, which has always striven to remain neutral. Reminiscent of Belgium and the Netherlands (it even gets its name from the name of the Roman province that inhabited those very lands in the real world, Gallia Belgica), they rely upon a balance of power and a policy of universal conscription to keep them free. However, their rich stores of that precious resource prove too tempting for the Empire, and they seek to add Gallia to their conquests. You take control of Squad 7 of the Gallian Militia. As an underdog in a nation which is itself an underdog, you'll have to make miracles happen if you're going to win.  Gameplay essentially takes the form of turn based tactical combat, much like Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, or Xcom. However, it modifies that combat by shifting the focus from a top-down overview to an over the shoulder third-person camera. You manually control your soldiers as they run for cover, flank the enemy, and open fire. You take aim at your targets, and you will need to balance the extra damage of headshots vs. the reliability of body shots.   Also unlike most tactical games, the enemy is able to harm you even during your turn. Every unit is essentially on overwatch, and if you enter their line of sight and weapon range, they will shoot you. This simple alteration adds much complexity. You'll find yourself crouching behind cover, waiting until the enemy runs out of ammo and has to load a new clip, which gives you the opportunity you need to assume a stronger tactical position, or an optimal firing point. You'll discover the joys of providing forward cover with your tank, and of shattering your enemy's defensive lines with shell, cannon, and machine gun, leaving them open to your supporting infantry.  Outside of immediate combat, much of the gameplay revolves around visiting your headquarters on a regular basis to upgrade your squad's gear, level them up, unlock their special abilities, and to customise your roster. Unfortunately, there are very few choices to be made here, and it largely becomes a checklist that you must go through every time you complete a major mission. While the game is a JRPG, it does fall flat when it comes to upgrades and customisation. There are few options, and thus there is little investment. On top of that, the UI is obtuse, and rarely gives the information that you'll want to make an informed decision. If you're trying to min-max, you'll need to resort to third party sources.  Overall, though, the gameplay is highly engaging. It offers visceral tactical satisfaction, while also rewarding forward strategic planning. The battiefields are detailed and varied, making each mission a unique and memorable experience, and the stylized graphics really bring them to life. Resembling a watercolor, the engine does an amazing job at painting a colorful world that draws you in.  Amidst this combat unfolds the story of Squad 7. You'll follow and author their story as they clash against the Empire. Nearly exclusively following their operations, rarely will you be shown the larger scope of the war. Focusing more on the drama and relationships of those under your command, this is, at heart a love story. Despite this, the game still attempts to interlace moments of gravity which have relation to actual historical events and this, in my opinion, the game's biggest flaw. The tonal shifts are breathtaking, and the game shows no signs of awareness.  The most indicative example I can give is in one of the squadmates. You recruit some of them randomly as you progress through the game, and it behooves you to rotate your roster so that you can unlock their potentials equally. At one point, a new character pops up, and I slotted her into my active team. When this occurs, a corresponding entry is made into their personnel file, giving you some basic story and character traits. I took a look, and what I saw there blew me away. This character is twelve years old. In the standard fantasy worlds that JRPGS tend to inhabit, this is nothing too concerning. In a game that is styling itself as a facsimile of one of the most horrible, costly, and scarring events in the entirety of history, it's just jawdroppingly inappropriate.  If she was put in as a metaphor for the state of desperation and determination that a modern nation in arms has to be brought to in order to achieve victory, then it makes sense. The call to resist until the last, putting children and women in the line of danger is something that is all too real. Instead, the game is blissfully unaware that there might be something horrible in handing a twelve year old girl a rifle and sending her to the front lines to fight for Queen and Country.  It was at this point that I realized the game wasn't really trying to be more than a JRPG, and I should accept it for what it was. I began to enjoy it more and more, and as of the writing of this review, it is one of my absolute favorite games. Through a combination of engaging tactical combat, an endearing story, and a beautifully artistic graphics engine and design, it won me over. I was drawn into its world, and I accepted it, quirks and all. If you're also willing to do so, then I highly recommend Valkyria Chronicles."
"Brillant gameplay, corny yet engaging narrative. 10/10"
The game you must get. great story and combat. Great First Person Shooting Role-Playing Game!!!
really nice game. wonderful time killer
"Valkyria Chronicles is so amazingly fun. Even if the strategy genre is not your thing, you still may like it. I mean, they're definitely not my thing, and yet I'm in love with this one. Gameplay, story, characters, all are excellent. And the campaign seems long, 20+ hours in and it doesn't look like it will end that soon, which for me, it's a pretty big plus."
Great strategy game that harkens back to the day when Sega really knew how to make good a good RPG/Strategy
"I have more than 50 hours in this game on ps3, and i'm gonna play all over again cuz this game is incredible *0*"
"A surprisingly good Turn Based JRPG from SEGA with a beautiful fantasy WWII setting. The story may sometimes be overly dramatic and rely too much on old anime cliches, but it's still very well told. Add to that a great cast of memorable characters and you'll most cerntainly be invested on this tale from start to finish."
"X-Com meets a JRPG in a very well done PS2 port. Pretty, decent story, good gameplay. Not recommended if you hate a lot of cut scenes."
"Gonna keep this short and sweet. I love this game as much now as I did when it first released. Top... 3, at the very least, of my all-time favorites."
StoryTime/10
this is game is so much fun and addicting i only just cracked the game but i can tell its goipng to be a fun game i hope its long
"I came into this game with high expectations for quality gameplay for a turned based game and what I got out of it was much more. This game includes the previous DLCs from the ps3 version and so much that I didn't expect. The visuals are impressive and very much so because the art style is watercolor (I believe so), the story and depth of the characters are very compelling and its not hard to get attached to some characters. There are bios for each individual character in the game and backgrounds that you can build up and update over time. The gameplay is fun but might take a while to go through a match. Perma-death is an interesting concept for the non-main characters. Theres so much to talk about when its Valkyria Chronicles but I think its better if you were to try it for yourself. If you like fire emblem, JRPG, turn based, deep characters, an interesting story, strategy, then this game is for you."
I got arrested by a cute girl for drawing a fish.  10/10 would draw fish again.
"This is one of the best turn based strategy games I've played and has one of the best plots. Also only game I know that actually pulls off story book presentation WELL. It's as if Advance Wars, XCOM and Fire Emblem all came together to make an amazing game with a dash of Fallout with the potential to make an army of waifus. Only issue is framerate occassionally drops for no reason.  Game of Year. Tank comes out of river."
"Solid 60FPS, DLC included, fully customizable controls (keyboard, mouse, and controller), 4K resolution support, and virtually no loading screens. The port is phenomenal. I actually had to go make sure the game was actually saving because it happens so fast.  As far as the game, it's a blend of turnbased with real time. Where you get points to spend each turn and you then control each unit real time (One at at time). I bought this blind and have not regeted it. Some basic tatics are needed, like not runnning your units in front of a tank loaded with cannnons and machineguns. But you're learn quick enough.  Would highly recommend upgrading everything you can, the extra hp and gear helps. As a well as aiming for the head (Grabbing a sniper for most missions is amazing also, ♥ Marina Wulfstan)  So toss down 20 bucks and give this game a shot!"
I like it. You have to be very precise. It is so chill to play this game.
"long, drawn-out pacing. still a beautiful game tho with tons of waifu material"
"Long story short: This game is amazing.  Short story long: This game is amazing because of many things. The art style is beautiful, the gameplay is very action packed and tense, the strategy elements are deep, the voice acting is (surprisingly) good, and the cutscenes are like watching a movie. If you are looking for an insanely good strategy RPG, check out Valkyria Chronicles. You won't regret it.   10/10"
Great game !  Luv the story and the graphic as well.  Can't wait for VC 2 and VC 3. XD  
"It's like Fire Emblem meets Xcom! You command a small ragtag militay squad as you tactically fight against the invading, gigantic empire, in a fantasy WWII-ish setting. Being a strategy game, making careful choices about what units to bring to battle, equipment, unit placement, and when to perform actions will factor into your victory or loss; your people can die permanently. Every member of your group has unique traits, from their class skills to their personality and interests. The art and story is presented in an sketchbook, anime style; it's very pretty.  Some gripes I had though include when units are in proximity to opposing units, they'll be fired upon until they perform an action. This can kill your guy if you stand around planning your next move or just get distracted. The aforementioned anime-like presentation may seem goofy and out-of-place to some, especially for a game that's like WWII.  Had to deal with a technical problem too; when I first played this game on my laptop, the video was incredibly slow and choppy. The game by default does not recognize your gaming video card, but this is fixed easily. However, if you play this on a laptop with only the intergrated video card, you're screwed."
"This is such an awesome game, i still love this game even though I perfected it everything on the PS3 version. I played the @nd and still love the series. i tried playing the third one but I was waiting for the US version sadly it never came. But I was so happy it came to the PC.  Still best game ever! 10/10"
"Really fun gameplay, great story, good music and great style. You should definitely get this game, you will not regret it."
"In the name of the empire this game IS THE BEAST!!!!!!!!!!!! it has a wondefull, enjoyable story line that is easy to understand, the combat is very well crafted and the characters are divine is their own rites!!!!! my favorite characters are some of the empire's generals :D. the illistrations are amazing, mixing water colors with anime stylized graphics, absolutely genious!!! this game is my number 1 of all time and shall be my most played, EMPEROR BLESS"
Great Game! Amazing story and excellent gameplay. Missions are very hard.
"A fantastic experience in the vein of xcom or fire emblem if they were told through an anime story book. If you arent a fan of anime, don't let the art style put you off from experiencing a great game, the story is solid, the characters are well developed and the actual game play is rather interesting and difficult. the game has also aged rather well for a game that was originally on the PSP and PS2/3, I hope they release the sequels to steam as well."
"This game was a sleeper hit on the PS3 back in 2008. It's gameplay is a mix of turn-based and 3rd person shooter, called the BLiTZ (Battle of Live Tactical Zone). To back up the gameplay its storyline is a grand tale of an underdog contry, Gallia, trying to defend itself from becoming Imperialize by the Empire. You get to handpick your squad from around 30 different members and they are each voiced acted. Anyway go buy this game to get SEGA know that they need to make another one of these games on the consolse and PC! I bought this game 3 times now (once for the PS3 and twice for the PC). ;D Yeah it's that good!"
"Waited to get the game on sale. Went on sale, got it and loved it :) Brings me back memories when i played it on the ps3"
"Valkyria Chronicles is not a game that I would usually buy for myself. It was gifted to me when a friend recommend that I give it a try. I will say from the outset I was skeptical but the gameplay is fun. The story is conventional but entertaining, and the premise is rather enjoyable.  The pros of the game is that it's easy to play through a quick mission or two and then put the game down for awhile. You don't have to have a lot of time investment and you can save between episodes. The episodes are a unique feature that's part of the game engine and the watercolor graphics make the game a real joy to watch played out. The music is great and the dialogue barely grazes camp, and tries to treat the material somewhat seriously.   The cons of the game is it isn't as customizable as advertised. As you level up the unit types they unlock random abilities but you do not get to choose which. In addition there seems to be no point to leveling the units except to unlock those random abilities - and not all of them are beneficial. In addition, it is hard to quantify weapon and tank upgrades. How they impact the damage you deal out and receive. The only variety between characters within a single unit type are their personal backstories which sometimes influences the kind of abilities they have.  Lastly, while neither a pro nor con, the missions themselves are based on a graded system that seems to punish the player for defensive play. Within the first ten missions, on more than four of them the only way to earn an A rank would be to do a scout rush to the final objective with such tight command point limitations you can lose the whole attempt with poor accuracy when shooting down vital targets. This could be considered the challenge of the game, but most combat episodes have a 20 turn limit. This would not be an issue if the money and experience you received to level troops and buy upgrades were not tied to this grading system. A second play of the game I ran with my tandem A ranked game, found the classes and the upgrades considerably lagging behind because of a lack of exp or money."
Squad 7 ROLEOUT!!!  10/10 would roleout again.
"I was pleasently surprised....I saw all the great reviews, so I thought I take a chance. and wow what a great game. I recommend to everyone"
"An excellent game, would recommend to any fans of games like advanced wars."
"Defend the Anime Netherlands against Russian Nazis, and overcome magic with the power of friendship. And tanks.  As a fan of Fire Emblem, XCOM, and anime in general, this was a must-buy for me. Fifty hours later, all of my expectations were realized. This is an excellent title, with a good mixture of story and gameplay. With the addition of a New Game+, the replayability is also excellent, allowing players to try out as many different strategies as they want.  In conclusion, Alicia is best girl."
"I played this on the PS3 five years ago, and it hasn't lost any of its charm. It is a JRPG in the Fire Emblem/Final Fantasy Tactics style, but with more fluid control over each unit. The World War II-esque setting is engaging and makes tactical choices much harder than the fantasy games that usually fit this mold. The art style is incredible as well.  I cannot recommend this game highly enough. 10/10."
"This was one of my favorite PS3 games because it was so unique and innovative. I played through it several times. It is a masterpiece in terms of art design, sound design, gameplay, performance, and story telling. This new version supports 1080p, removes the framerate cap, includes all previously released DLC, and it even has trading cards and achievements (the original never got PSN trophy support.)  The story draws inspiration from World War II and really shows the horrors of war and prejudice from the perspective of the regular people. It tells a compelling story with very likeable characters who actually grow and change during it's 25-30 hours. Somehow, this game manages to make war seem much more terrible than the more realistic looking war games, and it does it without all the gore and profanity. While the anime style cel shaded visuals may not appeal to everyone, and the dialogue is a bit awkward at times (no complaints about the voice acting), the tactical combat is where the game really shines. You get to put together a squad of 20 members composed of 5 different classes that can all be leveled up. You can purchase better gear for your team. You get a letter grade at the end of each battle based on how many turns it took you to complete the objectives, which determines how much XP and money you get. Characters that like each other can perform powerful combo attacks. There is an intricate system by which each squad member has passive skills that trigger under certain conditions. For instance, if you make a character with allergies walk through tall grass, they lose some of their effectiveness; a character with the lone wolf trait performs better when no one is near them, but worse when they get too close to others. Oh, and did I mention you get a TANK? So I can definitely recommend this to people who like games like Shining Force, Fire Emblem, and Disgaea, possibly even XCOM: Enemy Unknown too."
Awesome Turn Base Strat game. There's not enough of these. There's also a heavy Visual novel base element to it. If you like games like XCOM you'll love this. It's simple and engaging. One run through took me 30 hours.
"XCOM meets Anime the game.  Nice gameplay, good port overall and not expensive.  Go for it!"
WW2 + Anime + fancy stuff = Valkyria Chronicles  Pro  -Nice art style -Fun deep strategy game -Tons of contains. -Create a squad full of your waifu(or Bara hunsbando)   Con  -Turns take too long -Not a good pc port -Menu is confusing  -Not enough moe waifu (or muscular bara hunsbando).
One of my favorit game on PS3. A solid turn base strategy RPG with decent story and art style. The pacing might be too slow for some due to the nature of being a turn based strategy game.
Selvaria's gun is my waifu
I LOVE IT BEST GAME EVR IT GAVE ME EMOTIONS AND INTENCE AND SUCH i am sad the game ended and the otehr 2 games look like poo but this is the best game ever but there is one annoying thing the tanks movment if i was to move my tank sometimes the screen willand waist alot of my AP but bersies from thast BEST GAME EVER
"(Played the PS3 version to completion)  This was one of the best RPGs last generation, if not the best. I just purchased it a second time on steam because I loved it so much on PS3. Everything about it is great, story, characters, graphics, gameplay, difficulty, game length... I have zero complaints about the game. Keeping my fingers crossed that they port Valkyria Chronicles 2 as well."
"Pros:  Art direction good. Mostly playable without sound. Gameplay is overall fun. Sometimes difficult. Some characters well thought-out, albeit one-dimensional.  Cons:  A million ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cutscenes that require player input to load one at at time.  Mediocre voice acting. Main character is an artistic weirdo and profoundly unlikeable.  The pre-battle maps are cartographically poor -- basically you have to load a battle into the battle to see what the battlefield even looks like to decide how to deploy.  EXP and DUC you earn after each battle rewards methodical play while battle rank rewards quick mission completion.  Windowed mode does not run in background.  Menu controls are directly ported from console and are therefore clunky.  Story is an incredibly anodyne moralist adaptation of World War II."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a bizarre anime retelling of WW2, with all the players mixed up. You are Latvian Switzerland being invaded by Russian Nazis, so your humble squad of conscripted militia takes arms and put their compulsory military training to the test. Thank goodness your dad left you a freaking tank.  The story is anime as hell, but its not bad. It may be melodramatic and cheesy but its also sincere, and at times it even gets pretty damn dark. The fights are just the best though, absolutely some of the most entertaining tactical combat I've ever played. Nothing beats setting up fields of fire and watching your enemies die trying to push through. The combat is fairly deep, and the weird focus on characters, personalities and interactions adds some fun opportunities to really kick some ♥♥♥ if you build your team right.  I've played through this game twice on PS3, and lord help me here I go again, definitely one to check out if you missed it. The port is solid, it runs great and the graphics benefit from being fairly stylized so they don't come off as dated as they might otherwise."
10% Waifu War II 20% Anime Xcom 15% Playing 'Guess That Voice Actor' 5% Wow the main character is a nerd 38% Wow I love every character anyway though 12% WHY ARE THERE SIX PEDALS IF THERE ARE ONLY 4 DIRECTIONS 100% REASON TO BUY THIS GAME
"I don't normally leave reviews for games, but this one is special. I highly reccomend this game for the story and the unit tactics including leveling your soldiers and research and developement. I wish the the developers had licenses for Warhammer 40k. The style of the animations enchances the story and the combat. I found it when it was on sell for ten bucks. I bought my daughter and a copy. She is a big anime fan and enjoys the game."
"A very fun game at first, certainly got a good bit of play out of it, but ultimately repetative. The game has difficulties making missions more challenging, and tends to simply hike up the numbers (health, damage, number of foes) rather than mixing up the difficulty with challenging AI and enemy placement. The biggest issue with this is replayability. Since the best and only effective strategy to get the best rewards is to use your fastest units, you end up rushing past everything to capture the enemy base in less than 5 turns, ending the level. The voice acting is hammy, but not awful, and the story is cute, and has some genuinely fantastic parts, so it's certainly entertaining.  I would recommend to someone who likes anime-drama and very 'japanese'-game turn based mechanics. Would not recommend this to someone looking for an intense squad-based shooter/strategy game."
"So far this game is amazing. Yes, the story is a bit heavy handed at times but is overall fairly endearing for a war drama. The combat is unique and fresh. Fun and well worth the price."
"Loved it when I first played it on ps3, still loving it now! Heres hoping 2 gets ported to PC as well."
"Just got Valkyria chronicles in the steam sale, and oh my god, best game 2014, in fact probably best game since something like Mass Effect 3. It's like XCOM and real time strategy had a baby, sent it back in time to an alternate universe, it developed good characters, an interesting plot and fab music and then its life story was recollected in a unique and beautiful art style. Seriously, stop reading this review and just buy it, trust me - you will not be disappointed... or if you are then you either hate strategy games or are a moron. Seriously, buy this game, buy it NOW (or when it's on sale, either way works)."
Only a few hours into this game im on chapter 6 and so far I am drawn completely into both this games story and gameplay. So glad this game came to PC since ive never been big on Playstation but haved always loved certain titles. All in all this game is a serious 10 so far i have wanted to play this one for quite some time now and its definitely not dissapointing so far. I suppose ill come rewrite this review at endgame but for now im sold on the world Valkyria Chronicles drawn you into and the unique gameplay it provides.
Excellent strategy game that holds up perfectly to this day.
"This game was the reason I brougt PS3 not long ago, but I was dissapointed when the game was not available as digital download. And now STEAM releasing: Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1 and soon DW8 Empires which basicly kicking my NUTS for making that desicion.  By the way the game is exelent as I expected, there's alot positive to talk about.   The game is a turn-base strategy. In short you get the experience like you're playing X-Com, but have stories, characters and less punishing (your squad can get permanent death). one battle can last 20-1 hour (if count re-loading game) beautyful art-style graphic, etc.... The English voice acters is fine, if you don't like it you can change to japanese.  But I'll point out something that's bothering me: - Cutsceens/events are play by choosing frame (like comic style) and all pictures in the frames are not hidden but are weak no-colored-transparent, which give you the hint of what could happend and thous can spoil/ruin the tentions the stories try to build - Cover mechanic is clunky and limited - Hit-Box can get frustrated  Overall Valkyria Chronicles still a very good game since launched in 2008"
One of the Best Gsmes That i Have ever played
"Technically excellent, with exception of no 'Exit to Windows' ability for when you are done, despite this being a port for PC. Don't know why anyone thinks leaving that out is ok.  The dialogue is how adolescents talk or even younger. Jarring when the characters are military. Anime Girl Giggles for a paranoid officer is totally out of place.  Control side of things is fine.  45 minutes in &amp; its seems 60/40 Story/combat. Story side is good appart from adults talking like kids."
I really want to attend a school which teaches'armored vehicles class' as well. Lovely game
"In a word, this game is AWESOME. I'd leave the review there, since that's what you need to know, but some of you out there are sticklers for detail, so here's my pocket review:  At its heart Valkyria Chronicles is a squad based tactical RPG. The backdrop is the war between the tiny coujntry of Gallia and the evil empire. What is refreshing is that it is based around conventional weapons, and you get to drive tanks. Your squad members are split into classes, each bringing their own abiliies to the fray. There are varied missions in terms of terrain, opponents and objectives which will require you to use everythign in your arsenal.   The PROs:  -The setting is awesome, a real feel for the characters and the story, it is immersive and you actually care what happens - The graphics are refreshing, an interesting style -Intuitive and thoughtful gameplay -Replayability potential is major. Even once you have finished the main campaign, there are new events to unlock, classes to level up and achievements to be got -The campaign can last 40-50 hours, so represents decent value in itself -This is a great port and the full package, all DLC from the console version is included -Full Japanese Audio CONs:  -I seriously can't think of any. Even at full price this is worth every cent  Buy it. You won;t regret it  "
"This is not just a game. It is a life experience. I laughed and cried while playing this game.   To actual review, this game is turn based action. If it isn't your cup of tea you won't like it. If it is then you'll absolutely love the gameplay and story."
"It's definately a fun game, also forces you to think of more intresting tatics to avoid lost rounds or chracters for better rating on a mission. The story is well done but somewhat predictable at times, really well rounded game with fitting sound track. The pc version is a little odd going through menues, with mouse as the 'enter' though your real enter key is the start button. Even with those flaws still one of my favorite games I've palyed single palyer."
"An innovative and compelling turn-based strategy game that was originally released for the PS3 in 2008. The catch here is that you must play every unit's turn in real time, as a third person shooter (albeit a remarkably simple one). High praise has been lavished upon this game's story, but it didn't do a whole lot for me. Felt like your hackneyed anime plot, and the writers certainly made a point to check every old, trite anime cliché from the list. But that's the unimportant part - the game itself is of an unusually high quality and just bursting at the seams with creativity. I was quite impressed with the game mechanics and main gameplay loop. It's one of these rare games that renews your hopes for the medium, one which proves that the old 'everything has already been done' adage is simply not true. This game will fan the flames of experimentation and munchkin-like system exploitation in you, it will make you catch yourself devising strategies for it when you're not even playing. Plenty of collectibles, customization and unlockables ensure high replayability, as does the variety in tactical possibilities inherent to the game itself. Difficult too, especially if you wish to obtain A rank in every mission, skirmish and challenge. This game is a mandatory purchase for fans of strategy/tactical games, and I happen to believe it is just good enough to instigate a veritable conversion in those who aren't."
"Great game, simply wonderful! Beautiful graphics, interesting characters, good plot, GREAT combat system, and epic cut scenes. I have finished all the game plus the Skirmish Battles &amp; the DLC in 76 hours, and my final rank for this Masterpiece is 9,2/10.  I really want to suggest SEGA to make a PC port also for Valkyria Chronicles 2 &amp; 3. I'll buy them for sure, if my PC is enough powerful for them."
"This is a simple, but, well done tactical RPG with a fanciful WWII theme.   Pro's:  Good story You won't max tech or toon levels mid game Thorough Creative   Con's Not an anime fan, so, the cut scenes started killing me LOS issues - this is my biggest complaint! "
"Great game. I have this game for the PS3 and decided to get the Steam Version. First off for folks that say that the control sucks my suggestion is to get an Xbox wired controller for the PC. The controller works WAAAAAAY better than the keyboard controls.  If you like anime, xcom, strategy, character rpg elements this is the game for you. Great gameplay, storyline with cool cut scences, and character developement make this game a classic. Only downside is that some missions/chapters can take a LOOOOONG time to complete and can take multiple attempts. One of my favorite games on the PS3."
"There is not much that has not been said about this amazing game! The story is one of the better stories of war and has it's dark momments and delievers it in a respectable manner. Character Devolpment is excellent with each squad member truly feeling unique since everyone has their pros and cons. Learning to pair friends and keeping enemies apart manner and this one of those games where placement manners. The wave of customization is plentful and the rewards of killing specific 'Aces' aids to the fun factor of the game! Music is well done to the touch of the game and fits in with every turn. If you think Anime is not this thing this game might open you up to it since it is more than just a third eprson shooter RPG/RTS! It is a way of caring for everyone and making the Operation a success! 10/10 Do not delay, buy the game and enjoy!"
"A good old fashion strategy game that has a pair of tanks to fight of almost invicible goddess of battle. Saving a country is hard work, but keeping your people alive while fighting off tanks, and motoring shooting railroad cars is something in itself which I find enjoyable as well"
best JRPG ever made!!! SEGA should have more JRPGs like this! the story is so good it could compete with the last of us!!!!!!!! :D but there is some glitchs but it's forgiveable so 9/10.
Port 8/10 Graphics 8/10 Gameplay 9/10 Story 9/10 Character Development 9/10 Historical Accuracy 1935/10    Subtitles Translation 1/10
"I was surprised by this game. I expected something halfway decent, and then my expectations went down a bit upon seeing the thinly veiled references to WWII, but this game delivers beyond any expectations. Deep storyline that doesn't make the same hackneyed references to historical events other games fall into, and a fantastic cast of voice actors that I recognized even from other games such as Dawn of War II! If you've got the money to spend and you're wondering about what to spend it on?  Buy... This... Game...  Don't think twice about it. Just buy it. It's worth every penny."
"What an absolutely beautiful, and original game! I love the mix of a turn based strategy game with the action game format of the individual moves. Port seems flawless so far. What a game! 11/10"
"This is my first review of a game, which means I've actually taken the time to write one that this game deserves. This is my first JRPG game I've played and might be the 'gateway' game to draw me into the genre. I can honestly say this game is worth it's 10/10 rating on Steam. It's been awhile since a game has gotten me glued on my chair for hours and hours. The gameplay for me was very fluid and I didn't encounter any bugs despite it being a port over from the PS3. The story was fantastic in my opinion, although it had a few extreme moments and ideas, it seemed like a pretty realistic spin-off of WWII (obviously not meant to be taken literally realistic). Although each main character had a solid story behind them and development, the side characters weren't really emphasized. I noticed this when I was picking squadmates and didn't even know half of them existed. That being said, they are not entirely forgotten because this game provides the player all the lore content in certain sections to keep the player well informed about the world they are playing in. I wasn't really one to judge the graphics since that wasn't the key thing I was looking out for, however I personally think the graphics were on point the way they are since they are trying to make a 'storybook' look to the game and my computer ran it fine. THE SOUNDTRACK WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING, from the mildly intense battle background music to amazing violin pieces, the music was right on point. I definitely recommend this to my friends and other people as well with a solid 10/10. SQUAD 7 MOVE OUT!"
Good game and a good story. Controls take a bit to get use to if you arent using a gamepad but even with keyboard and mouse it is very managable. Ranking system is a bit silly because it rewards reckless gameplay and capturing a base or defeating a specific enemy asap. Though it is very possible to beat the game your first playthrough without grinding or getting the best ranks.
"I picked this game up on a whim, as JRPG type games aren't always my thing, and I was plesantly surprised by the ease with which picking up the game mechanics was while still providing a pretty decent challenge. With the resurgence of games like XCOM: Enemy Unknown back into the mainstream, this is a pleasant game with a little more backstory to it.  The battles can be quite long, but they balance it out with the storyline - cutscenes into the lives of those participating in the war - what every war comes down to, the men and women on the ground. It's definitely heavily JRPG invluenced, but combines aspects of Turn based strategy into it as well. And the graphics are amazing - I mean I enjoy just watching the detail of the artwork that was put into the game.  There are some glitches, sure, with the tank controls sometimes being finicky, but the pros of the artowrk, storyline, and combat challenge outweigh it in the end. And the music is pretty good as well, although the voice acting can be a little flat at times.  I would definitely recommend this game to those who are fans of XCOM and don't mind the occaisional step away from normal western video games to latch onto this JRPG-Strategy combination."
Very fun combat and challenging challenges leads to sometimes long and rewarding battles.
"Wonder mix of Anime, WWII Turn-based Tactics and light FPS. You'll enjoy watching the story unfold as much as fighting your way turn-by-turn through the battle field."
"A great, beautiful game that stands solidly within the turn-based strategy genre.  Valkyria Chronicles is a heavily story-based game that revolves around a fictional reinterpretation of Europe during World War II, in which the protagonists fight for a small nation surrounded on all sides by giant neighbors at war. In the course of fighting for their country, Squad 7, a militia group, takes on a variety of missions in order to safeguard their home.  Key features of the game include a brilliant art-style that permeates the game, the result of Sega's CANVAS engine in effect, a unique way of bringing about battle in Command Mode, and unique squad members whose personalities can provide a much needed change-up in how you approach battlefield scenarios.  Make no mistake, the story is the main feature, here, even though the missions themselves are enjoyable: Cutscenes will be frequent and many. Unfortunately, this can leave some variation to be desired in terms of actual gameplay, as the notable battle system used in missions tends to be drowned out by highly predictable events and AI, even to a fault, which sadly does tend to leave the replay value rather low. Still, as a parcel, the game is unique, endearing, and something that definitely deserves at least one playthrough.  PROS: -A unique approach to Turn-Based Warfare -beautiful artwork and style that evokes watercolor painting in motion -an overall engaging story with many chapters -unique squad members whose personalities and traits change how you play -a solid, single-player experience  CONS: -most battles are somewhat predictable; most A ranks can be achieved through rote memorization rather than skill -little to no replay value, despite a new game+ mode  I sincerely recommend this game for the asking price of $20 (at the time of this review). A single playthrough might be all you get out of it, but it will definitely be worth it. I hope that SEGA will realize the potential profit to be had, here, and also port the following two titles to Steam, as well."
One of the best RPGs on Steam. It is a good value with all of its DLCs included. Highly recommended.
"If you like single player campaigns with an extremely rich and unique story and style, yet, you like to be challenged and, you have patience to sometimes need several tries until completing a hard mission, then this is the game for you.  The game starts rather easy, progresses to hard towards the end, but it is well worth it."
I love this game. a little different then the anime but very good none the less
"It's a rpg tactics game thats pretty awesome and hard, until you you found out about how OP a certain character is..."
Amazing! Wait 2nd and 3rd part.
"Back in school you always heard the stories about the Civil War and how they got younger men to join the war by having them put a slip of paper in their boot reading the number '18' and then asking them if they were over 18... Boom, it worked.  Now imagine this same process except its built into the very foundation of a middle school.  'But sir, I'm only 13 years old.' 'Can you hold a gun?'  '...Yes?'  'WELCOME TO WAR, SON!'  Ten oudda ten."
"This is an amazing turn base JRPG, the pencil draw gameplay so just so sexy lol"
This game make me happy inside.
"A tight, well-crafted game. The animation and aesthetic is gorgeous, and at times, soothing. The gameplay is well-rounded, unique, and requires you to think tactically and make smart decisions. The story and characters are both endearing and fun to watch. However, there are many unecessary cutscenes and micromanagement flaws out of combat that only make you thirst more for a refreshing firefight. Overall, Valkyria Chronicles is a wonderful strategy game full of heart and addicting action, but is also riddled with menu difficulties and a few other quirks."
"A fun game, emotionally-involving and deceptively tricky. The difficulty horrifically spikes around chapter 5, when you face the first real 'boss' - a tank that can pretty much insta-kill any unit and is almost invulnerable.  The art is beautiful, and the voice-acting good, if a little cringeworthy near the beginning.  So, if you want an XCOM-style game that's also a World War 2 allegory with a beautiful art style, this is for you!  Note: There seems to be an unavoidable crash at the beginning of Chapter 3, but it can be avoided by following the steps here:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/294860/discussions/0/620696934087592574/ "
"Some kid threw a hissy fit in the forums about the tank in the second level and wanted a refund.  Don't let the tank get you down, just walk past it.  "
"GOOD:   Great Art, Great Story, fun turn-based, squad based, game play, forgiving system requirements (plays perfectly on my I5, AMD Radeon 6xxx series with 8GB system ram)  BAD:  Nothing. EDIT: OK, one thing: Some missions can be a bit obtuse. I don't mind difficult, but I do like to know what tools I have, how they work (thinking elevators here among other things), and what I'm supposed to be doing. Another example here would be sandbags working to crouch--but counter-intuitively you can take advantage of them from flanked as well... things like that.  COULD BE BETTER:   Could be a little deeper strategy-wise, and movements of characters could offer more chance for fine tuning (talking here about trapping characters behind others, getting shot because you wanted to inch up to the edge of the wall not going past it, etc.)  BOTTOM LINE:   9/10 Excellent, if no-frills, port which plays just fine with keyboard and mouse. Insane value if you get it on sale, still great if you don't. I also suggest you check out the anime. It's fun, but the art is even better here in game!"
"A truly great adventure and story, even with the great gameplay aside its reason enough to get it. Plus there's a revive system unlike X-COM so you don't freak out if someone makes an impossible shot that kills one of your squad."
I always wanted to play the first of this series. It was never released on other platforms then ps3 now I can finally play it!
"There is a very unique turn-based/live action hybrid combat system buried under the neverending anime cutscenes.  My only gripe is that you have to completely ignore it and suicide rush through battles to get high ratings, and the cash&amp;exp with it. That is a baffling design choice.  Good buy at 50% off."
"The story is a fantastic bit of anime cheese with some heavy moments that are actually pretty decent, but you'll only really like it if you're ok with the pacing and style of an anime story. It'll take a while to get into the meat of the game as there are many, many unskippable cutscenes. If you're looking to dive right in, look somewhere else.  Many of the negative review complain about the difficulty of the combat. These people have clearly never played Xcom. This game is OVERWHELMINGLY forgiving compared to other turn-based games, Xcom chief among them. The combat is a fresh mix of third-person and tbs shooting, where the damage of your shots is calculated with the distance and range of your weapon. Refering back to Xcom and how comparatively easy this game is, if you're right up on an opponent in Valkyria, you will hit them.Sure they can shoot at you during your turn once your in range, and your troops can only retaliate and shoot when they're moving on your turn, but the computer needs that advantage. Once you've elite troops, they'll shrug off most damage as they approach units and easily mow them down.   The only frustrating feature is how ♥♥♥♥ed the tank movement is in the port. I've read reviews saying it was 'finicky' and I'd have to say that's not the whole picture. Quite simply, moving a tank in this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, nor is it ever properly explained. When you have to make a critical move and your tank is spinning in place wasting its action points, you'll be properly ♥♥♥♥♥♥.   Otherwise, combat always feels cool and the story won me over, despite how cheesy it is."
One of the best games I've evered played. Solid art and story. Great mechanics. Only thing I would have loved to see was multiplayer.
"First off, this is a visual novel/movie. I did not see that tag on the Steam store, but it absolutely applies. You make no choices at all, but watch the story unfold as a spectator. The only time you actually 'play' is during combat, where you take control of your troops. You can also buy upgrades for the troops. That said, the story is decent and the combats are fun to play.  The artwork as the Steam store reports, is hand drawn. The result looks very different from most games and visual novels. The art itself is quite good, but the animation quality is poor because of it being hand drawn. All of the dialogue is voice-acted, and this is pretty good too.  The game has several crash-related bugs which are talked about on the Steam forums, and I have experienced as well. The game is playable, but you will probably crash at least once or twice during your playtime. I had to use advice from the forums to get my game to play again, since it started crashing every time I tried to load the game. So this can be frustrating.  Overall, I am having fun with it so recommend it since it is entertaining and catchy. But if you hate visual novel types of 'games', stay away. If you do buy, a few tips: 1. Always bring an engineer to combats since the game is over if the machine dies (you'll see what I mean). 2. Your lancers are armed with lances, but these shoot- I mistakenly thought them melee lances and caused myself some frustration. 3. Always bring a good mix of troops to your fights- you never know what you'll encounter."
"Great Game, Amazing Port using the mouse to aim is fast and accurate it is so much better than a controller."
"Game is amazing. Completely worth your time. No regrets about going on this ride,"
"It has been a long time since I played a JRPG, so I decided to take the plung into this game to see how good it is. Bought it when it was $10 so I figured I was going to at least make it worth that much, but boy was I surprised by how fantastic this game is. The story, game mechanics, and amount of content it provides is more than enough to justify a full priced purchase. I completely fell in love with the characters and game play, as well as the visual style, which is another reason why I wanted this game. I have a large library of realistic looking games, enough so that I felt it was time to indulge in something with unique visuals and Valkyria Chronicles fit the bill!  I highly recommend this game for those that enjoy JRPGs, anime, or fairly challenging games that are pretty similar to XCOM: Enemy Unknown, yet another reason this game appealed to me."
9.5
"Not like others, this is squad command with a lot of cutscenes. Characters are funny, setting is great. Too much anime cliches for my taste, but that an anime game, what did I expect ? Combat is very interesting, A ranks overrated, story ok."
I remember that one day I didn't play this game. I felt dirty that day.
"Yes, hands down. This is prolly one of the best games I have ever played. I will come back to it again and again, for both the story and the turn based combat. the only thing I didn't like was that I could not read the 'articles' I purchaced from the Chronicle on the Wall. Oh, and stay through the end of the credits. It's worth it. I just wish it was longer."
Super Solid. Would like to see more turn based strategy games like this.
"This is probably the best JRPG I've ever played so far.. though this game can be somewhat frustrating...It took me like almost an hour just to finish one battle.  The art style is so unique &lt;3, never seen one like this before.   buy it, you won't regret.."
For Anime-lovers a really good and an entertaining game. Apart from a really slow narration and slow conversations between the ingame-characters the game does give enough challenge for strategy fans and a lot of variations are possible to try in term of the squad one wants to play with or the equipment for example. I have not finished the game yet but it never gets too boring and I really do enjoy it. All in all it is definetily worth it!
"This game is unique! is kind of a masterpiece that i've never seen before in games, unique experience with rich pieces of art based on japanese anime. the most interesting thing about the game is the movement based on turns. you have to think on what you'll do otherwise is 'game over'. reminds me Final Fantasy tatics from Square Enix. but on third person, more innovative and beatifull with a deep story that will keep you playing for hours without getting tired..."
"Valkyria Chronicles is an excellent example of pc anime games. interesting story, variety of characters, squad customization, and more.  I'll find myself in moments of 'wow, that's somewhat funny!', 'The hell?'. In each chapter, I can't help but not be bored of the dialogue, this including the arguably stupid/silly moments scattered throughout the game. I love the combat as it gives a similar feeling to Fire Emblem.  Some bad points to make would have to be the 'here and there' dialogue that doesn't feel like it fits the moment. These sort of slap you out of the immersion of the game; not that it's hard to get right back in of course. There are some units I feel are obviously not suited to be played, which sort of limits the characters you can play as a whole. Also I feel pressured to use the main characters over others in their class that are statistically superior. One last small complaint is that I wish you could fast forward through some animations during battle, but it only takes an extra second or two a few times each chapter.  As far as final words go, I recommend this game enough to write a legitimate review about it. Suitable to those interested in strategy, story, anime-like. Not for people looking for mmo-like, in depth and complicated, open world lovers.  My rating, taking all tags into account, would be 9.5/10 and deserves a definite look by everyone interested in purchasing."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a superb turn based strategy along the same vein of X-Com whereby you command a small rag-tag militia group defending the peaceful nation of Gallia during an enemy invasion. The game consists of two play modes (a la X-Com); turn based third person action in the battlefield coupled with book mode where troops level up, new weapons are manufactured and the large portion of the story is told.  The variety of levels is also impressive, with new mechanics introduced at a decent rate. Additionally, the visual style is stunning, and the characters are really developed to the point where it’s very upsetting to watch in individual perish. I’m at 30 hours gameplay time approx and I’ve heard the game generally lasts about 50-60 hours, so it’s definitely worth the money! My only criticism is that you cannot skip the enemy turn animation, but that certainly does not detract from the overall enjoyment I’m having with this game. I recommend this to fans of turn based strategies, anime, tanks, or just decent games in general."
Loved this games on the PS3 even better on PC
"A charming little game. Amazingly written, if cliched, storyline and engaging gameplay mechanics make this game a must buy. The wannabe artsy side of using cell shading and a constant 'frame' effect may annoy some but after playing a bit, it shouldn't noticeable.  To those trying to figure out what the actual gameplay is like, it's sort of a more loose/action version of a tactical game like XCOM. The classes don't act too much of a rock-paper-scissor type, they are more like specialists and specific characters will have traits that trigger when certain conditions are met (allergies, for example). There are no set 'grids', running around will require dodging rifle fire, and there are sectional damage, so aiming is a must. Credits and experience points earned after battles can also be used to upgrade unit types and weaponry."
I really love this game! The game has a very good story and gameplay. The art style is pretty cool to gaze at and the performance is very stable with its upgrade to HD and 60 FPS.
Fantastic game on PS3 so when I saw it out for PC I had to get it again. The art style of the cutscenes is unique and really brings forth the feeling of it being a novel (which essentially the game is). The strategies can change to suit each players style and still obtain a victory.  For anyone looking for a good single player strategy game. This is a good one to have in your library.
"this game has an awesome art style, its challenging but nothing frustrating, has an amazing story, and its just fun to play."
"This game is the most enjoyable SRPG I have played since Final Fantasy Tactics. Standard genre tropes are here like conditional permadeath and turn based combat. What Valkyria Chronicles brings to the table is an action point/movement radius system that makes the game feel like a tabletop war game.  The port itself is excellent. I had no technical issues during my entire playthrough.  Only gripe with the game is that the AI does not feel agressive enough and is very predictable after a couple tries on any scenario (the cutscenes can also be a little much). Other than that, it's fantastic game."
"Overall.. I'd say it's really great! I'm not too into it, but all in all, everything's pretty simplistic, it's fun, the visuals look great, and the plot's pretty top-notch! Also, the story is pretty well made. Over all, I reccomend it whole-heartedly, from my stand point."
"If you enjoyed FF Tactics, you will be right at home with this game.  Instant classic."
"Well, pretty good game and battle system :), but the story is kind of slow :("
"Yes!  I love Valkyria Chronicles. It was one of my favorite PS3 games, heck I'd go as far as to say it's one of my favorite Video Games ever. The story is great, the gameplay is fun, I love the characters, it's just an all around enjoyable experience, and I can honestly say that the games move to the PC has been a good one. This is a high quality port for a high quality game and I have no hesitation in recomending that anyone who enjoys Tactical RPGs and similar titles pick this one up."
"Mix Fire Emblem with XCOM, and add a dose of terrific RPG elements, and you get a truly engaging game."
Still heavily more enjoyable than any PC Strategy/RPG last 3 years.  PC Games industry is a huge let down last 3 years. Really fuss me alot. thats is why lots of console port is coming to save us.
"I actually wasn't expecting it to be that good. The story is one of the best I've seen in a while (English VAs are meh though). Great character development. The game play is really fun too, however some of the classes are mostly useless. Scouts and Engies are really really powerful."
I love this game. I love the Anime-style I love the Charakters I love the Story I love the battles  I love all of the game  10/10
"I've fallen in love with this game so quickly it still amazes me. It's a great and well-balanced mixture of story-telling and turn-based action/tactic fights.    Valkyria Chronicles   is a Japanese to the bone action RPG, though it feels more like an interactive anime. The setting and story are interesting and I haven't skipped a single cut-scene since the beginning. Our main task is to operate with Squad 7 during imaginary Total War in setting similiar to Europe's 1930s, every soldier has a unique set of potential skills, likes and dislikes that influence each battle. Co-ordinating these potentials may change the outcome of every battle.  It's a unique game for me and I'm really happy I stumbled upon this little jewel. Definitely worth a try - especially if you like anime atmosphere and turn-based battles."
"While there are some annoyance stemming from the fact that this is a console port, such as the control of the damn tank, it's still an excellent game. Highly recommended."
Fun turn based strategy third person shooter game. I've never enjoyed a turned based game so mucch!
"POV - 15 years US military with 8 years living in Japan. Burnt out from 'fan-service' anime turned to resentment.....and I went through a full bottle of 'Vinho do Porto'.  First impression....Loving tactical games but despising anime, this game was a gamble. So far the classic japan-not-really-understanding-the-outside-world is easily ignorable. There seems to be a very good strategy/FPS in this game that I will play the hell out off."
"For a start, Valkyria Chronicles is a brilliant strategy game that combines both tactical decision making using the map and correct maneuver control when out in the field. It's unqiue gameplay and rich story is enhanced even further by the great graphics and low requirement to run the game smoothly. So, if you are a fan of strategy games who wants a bit more action packed content, I will ensure you that this game is a worthy buy."
"Great game, well worth the price and looks pretty good for how old it is.  Be prepared for a good story and solid gameplay with some insane difficulty put in for good measure (until you either grind your way to godmode or figure out the proper use of orders)."
"This game is INSANE....LY good.   Pros: Great character development, story, intense-deep-complex gameplay, high difficulty  Cons: Very little skip options with dialogue, and you have to wait and see the enemies every single move which makes missions needlesly longer, it gets alittle tiring and boring at times (especially if you're redoing a mission)   GET THIS GAME IF YOU LOVE TACTICS."
"This is a great game for everyone who likes tactical based combat. The characters are also very likable. The battle system is enjoyable, and makes the overall gameplay really fun. Plus, soundtrack is amazing!"
"Having completed the PS3 version, I considered this one of the greatest games ever made, and easily my favourite of all time. When I found it on steam, I wanted to know how it fared on the PC.  And I can safely say it hasn't changed one bit.  This game still plays brilliantly. It didn't take long to adjust to the change in control scheme and the story, music and art style are still beautiful. A bonus, at least in my book, was the addition of the two DLC packages.  Anyone who enjoys stratergy games owes it to themselves to have this absolute gem of a game. 10/10"
The Story is Amazing and the game mechanics is like playing a warhammer tabletop game. Love it
Awesome game! They need to release part 2 on Steam.
"An epic tale of how a tiny, insignificant nation stands up against the might of a military giant. You play as the Squad 7 of the Gallian militia that has to go through a journey of war, love, sadness and intrigue while trying to save their country. This game will make even the most melancholy of hearts really feel, whether it be joy, anger, sadness or other. I genuinely cried... a lot, on several occassions throughout my playthrough and that is a very rare occurrence otherwise. If you want a game with a great story and very solid RPG/Strategy mechanics, then you should get this game!"
Holy crap this game is awesome. Unique play style and great characters. The artwork and cutscenes are sights to behold. I reccomend all strategy and rpb lovers to pick this one up.
"This is THE best game I've played since Star Wars Galaxies.  It's a mash up of FF Tactics, an FPS, Anime, and WWII. Both strategy and tactical gameplay here to enjoy.  I never review games on this site, but I though this game deserved one."
"This game is so much fun. If you like turn base this is for you, if you like anime style this is for you. Great game 10/10"
I do not write a lot of reviews on Steam but I had to for this game. Valkyria Chronicles is a Tactical Role Playing game that was originally for the PS3. The port you see on steam is one of the best ports I have seen in a long time. The only real identifier left that it was not originally a PC title is that the game still runs 'best' at 30fps with some weapons have fire rate issues when it plays at 60fps.   All in all the game is a wonderful port with fantastic gameplay and outstanding graphics. 10/10
"Its like a FPS and RTS put togther , bought this game for ps3 then saw it come in on steam instantly bought it again  "
"This game is so amazing. I laughed. I cried. The game's story is the best I've ever played. The gameplay is challenging throughout the whole game. I had a friend tell me about this game when he had played it back on the PS2(3?) and then the next day I searched for it and it was day of release for Valkyria Chronicles of Steam. The timing was perfect. Due to a busy schedule, it took me over 3 months to complete the game. I celebrated, when in actuality, there was at least a dozen more operations that I had somehow missed. I still have not achieved 100% completion, but this is a game I am devoted to getting that. You will love this game. You will laugh. You will cry. The combat will be intensive and forboding, but the desire to fight through to see the outcome will drive you on. Buy this game. Play it."
Very fun strategy game with a great story.
"I played this when it was on the PS3. I never got to beat it though. I quickly learned fter I picked it up that this game is magical. I sat at my computer for sixteen hours straight, absorbed by the entirety of it. My legs hurt for two days after. Play responsibly."
"Love the art work. Gameplay is smooth. Also recommend watching the anime, I believe only 25 or 26 episodes, too short. T_T"
"AMAZING game! I found some glitches though, the Lancer seem to have a few model problems and other characters as well. Please fix this, it would make the game so much better."
"Game is heavily driven by plot; however, the battles are immensely fun. Fire Emblem/Xcom Enemy Unknown style, but with more flexibility and customizations."
Awesome game!  Very good and original Gameplay mechanics.
Thumbs up !! Nothing else.
"A game i somehow got confused with another game, great pickup esp if you can get it on sale."
"Good but keep a Nerf ball around when you want to throw something. 3/5. Originally I would have given it a 4/5 but it was some the pure frustration in some missions that hurts it.   PROS +Command &amp; manage your own squad +Ok story +Turn based strategy with single unit live action control +Fantasy WWII twist anime +Lots of Bosses +Fairly open gameplay on how you want to approach the battles +Lots of characters +Open deserts, closed in forests, and even trench warfare  CONS -Frustrating. Unforgiving. Some missions really lock you in a certain way. Sometimes the only strategy is trial and error to know what enemy units to take down in what order like a game of sequence. A lot of the time they throw you into battles and although you get to choose your units (most of the time), you never have any idea what you will be facing. Start mission, fail, then figure out what you need, fail, then trial and error.  -Almost every mission is you being always outgunned, out manned, out maneuvered, facing impossible odds.  -Lots of Bosses -Most of your sqaud couldn't hit a barn door even if their gun barrel was resting on it.  -Poor tank control -Poor acting -Feel like just throwing the dice a lot instead of strategy   It is a good game. I only really started getting frustrated toward the later missions when you feel like a one man army against the entire empire who also has invulnerability on their side and only it gets more ridiculous every mission.    "
Brilliant game loved it on the PS3 and love it on the PC. this is a great port. I had many hours of fun playing this the story is interesting. The only down side i have is the fact that 2 and 3 of this game were PSP ports which is a shame as this is a hidden gem that deserved better than what it got. However if your looking for a nice RTS game with turn based elements this is the game for you
"Good story line. Good gameplay style. Good illustration. Good tutorial.  Haven't finish this game, but it is worth to play. =) More of this kind of game ( story line ) should be available in the world."
"Great game. Fun, challenging, good tactical battles. Great art and even the storyline is pretty strong."
"Incredible and captivating in story, graphics, cinematics, and gameplay. Consistantly adds new mechanics without feeling bloated or forced, and guides players to just the right extent without hand-holding excessively."
"The gameplay itself is great and unique. Played it originally on PS3, and hoping for HD remaster on PS4. PC port is not that great as people make it sound, yes frame rate,loading times and everything is better but after few hours of playing my units started to sink underground and the buggy Tank controls caused my Tank to move less than usual. Ruining A-rank runs and forced me to save every turn, which is ridiculous. (Gonna play with the controller that's for sure) Most characters in this game are meh..(Third has better)And most of the cutscenes are boring because they only show characters' faces while showing little emotion. Hurting the story a little bit. Both English and Japanese voice actings are good.Difficulty in this game is not that great either because of the enemy AI, even on Hard and EX Hard enemy actions are pretty stupid in some situations, you can leave your character standing open to be fired and they still won't shoot em only running towards to your camp or something else.. I gave PS3 version 8.5 so this PC port gets a 7."
"A true masterpiece of a SRPG, it looks beautiful and plays uniquely. The narrative has its hiccups later on, but is overall solid and engaging, if formulaic. Loads and loads of characters done right, a long campaign, and tough, rewarding strategic gameplay - Squad 7, move out!"
"Great artwork, good gameplay, decent storyline. A bit buggy with the tank, but in general, it is a fun game."
"This game is a great turn-based strategy RPG. It is my wifes favorite game of all time, beating out the original Zelda and Link games. Okay, she now saying Ms. Pacman is her actual favorite, but you get the picture. I am also very fond of this game. This is one of those must-play games from the PS3 era.   We have it for the PS3, and were very disappointed when the sequels were not released on the PS3. When I saw it on sale here on steam I was just... *shocked* and inspired so I bought like 5 copies for me and a bunch of friends. Fingers crossed they port over number 2 and 3 if this one is successful.   The trailer gives a good sense of the artistic style - just picture it in an alternate WW2 scenario. The story is focused on a militia squad in what would be Estonia/Latvia/Lithuania who defend against an overwhelming force from the east, say... Russia. Anyways I don't want to really say too much. It's a story of love, friendship and hardship in a time of war.  It is kind of hard to really explain how to the game plays. People familiar with the X-Com games will find familiar elements.  Try it out!   "
good story nice game mechanics and the lovely art style (but avoid the english dubbing)
War is Moe
Anime Xcom. Would buy the sequel if it gets ported to PC.
"Although I've never played the original version, I must say that this game is very interesting. Not something you'd normally expect our SEGA.  +Pretty nice soundtrack - not memorable, but pretty good. +Fair developed storyline - had potential to be improved. +Unique and diverse characters - secondary characters could use more significant roles. +Decent and original gameplay style - can sometimes be a little harsh/cool. +Fair performance on PC - could use some fixing. +Gives you the feels and intenseness - just my own opinion. +Good battle support systems - could be improved. +Interesting background and reference - could use some references in Asia.  +/-Long-term chapter battles - could take up to an hour, sometimes hard. +/-Lacks short and simple missions for players to do - needs constant gameplay. +/-Behavior of enemies can really benefit you/get you killed - could vary.  -Terrible accuracy of explosive-based weaponry - a serious bring-down. -Save system only allows one save slot (Saving on a DLC will get you stuck there forever unless you make a New Game and save there) -Cannot change initial difficulty - could be good or bad, depending on you. -Sometimes feels repetitive - another bring-down. -WAY too many cutscenes, not enough to balance between gameplay - read a lot of complaints on that. -Characters can act a little stupid at certain points - unneccessary racism. -Some anime cliches - too common in any anime franchise.  Overall, despite   some   flaws, the game turned out very well developed to a certain degree and I do recommend it those who have played it before and those who would like to play in an original gameplay style. Still better plot than the anime!  As for my rating: 78% 'Good luck and happy hunting.'"
"Great art, great voice acting, great game.  Hint: Always use Jann. He is fabulous.  Hint2: You are graded solely on speed. This means, run in like an idiot, leave your troops all at 1 hp (or critically wounded), and bum rush the objective. You have no time for tactics or field advantage. This is my one grumble with the game. If you don't care about the grading however, by all means, play it tactically."
"&gt;Great story , has Nice anime art style &gt;Unique real time and strategic gameplay &gt;Challanging/addicting &lt;fun&gt;  &gt;Lots of cute girls :D  &gt;Great with controller  &gt;able to customize your squad &lt;cute girls&gt; to your liking &gt;More Cute Girls :D &gt;Good Music &gt;Girl that makes you bread  11/10 Would want to recruit More girls :DD "
I will cry when i finished this game..  10/10 must have..
"I haven't played many turn based strategy rpgs, but I dived into this one because it looked cool, and it came highly recommended by many people. I can also recommend it with some caveats. So here's a realtime gamer's perspective:  I'll start with what I liked about the game. As I already said, I think it looks gorgeous both ingame and in the cutscenes. The localisation is very good: it's voiced by many veteran anime voice actors. The music is superb, and I liked the story a lot: it's a beatiful fantasy take on wars in general, with a bit of world war I vibes. If it were just a simple world war game, I would have been turned off (a dime a dozen), but it's an altered, fantasy version of europe and it's nations which makes it unique.  The gameplay is definitely slow paced for someone like me who plays realtime games mostly. I guess it's an acquired taste, as in the later stages of the game I came to appreciate the slow, strategic approach of defeating the enemy. With that said, there are some problems with difficulty in this game: one or two spikes in the difficulty throughout the game almost made me stopped playing it entirely. Imagine losing immediately to a cheap shot from the enemy AI after an hour and a half of slow paced battle...Unfun. And in that particular stage, that happened to me like 4-5 times, which made me feel the game did a bad job of making me ready for that battle, or miscalculated my skills at that point. But maybe I'm just a noob. It doesn't help, that the battle music is always the same, and it's super annoying! (unlike the rest of the entire soundtrack, which is awesome)  I did manage to come up with a winner strategy for that stage, and the rest of the game was a breeze. It was definitely worth it to finish the game because of the story, but it does require a lot of patience, and time."
Fun game with neat art style.
Mindblown at how much depth is put into this game definatly need to try it.
May be one of my top favorite games ever. I love it! Port Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 (Althougth they are PSP games) to the PC and I will buy them for certain. I will take them straight as is even.
This. Game . Roques
"War is hell, onii-san."
Very fun game with a challange and nice story driving it.  I can only picture how much harder this game is going toget via the story missions to clear for A ranks on missions o.o
"When I first saw this game, I didn't really think much of it at the time. After doing my research, I found out that this was a port of the PS3 version, and then I was now under the impression that it would be a horrible port, but I was wrong. This game managed to surpass my expectations many times over. It manages to combine the elements of a third-person shooter with a turn-based strategy game rather well, and it is backed up by a well written story filled with likable characters. The only complain I have about this game are the the god-awful, f♥♥♥♥♥♥ tank controls! They always f♥♥♥ up my strategies every time I try to move them around the f♥♥♥♥♥♥ map!! Anyways, putting the butt-hurt aside, this game is a must-play.  9 Flying pigs/10"
+Lots of content +Decent VA +Real time fighting +Requires thought in actions  -Looks okay
"Fantastic Game so far.  Really enjoy the whole story, the graphics and the gameplay. Everything seems to be in good order and I would highly recommend to anyone that like story driven rpgs to give it a crack."
Already played it on the PS3. It also has an excellent Anime. But the cartoonish look is a trap - behind this clever disguise you will find a die-hard strategy RPG that stands its ground among the giants of the olden days. The first few missions are fun. You control 3-5 guys and shoot in the general direction of the enemies until you win. Then the game introduces its army base mechanic and suddenly you control 20 guys. You also realize that unless you get a flawless S rank on all missions you will not have enough research points and money to properly upgrade your ragtag militia.  The later missions will make you commit Sudoku out of sheer shame. You will feel the lingering presence of a disappointed Asian ghost dad slowly shaking his head at every move you make. How did you not anticipate that a tank will burst through that wall 30 minutes into the mission? Why didn't you plan ahead?  Shame. Shame. Shame.  If you ever played the original Z then you know how addictive these games can get.  Buy it and cancel all your Christmas plans.
"i love this game so much ^^ i beat it a couple of times on my ps3, and im so happy to see that the steam version is exactly like it! i hope sega would import more of their timeless classics on steam &lt;3"
Good points  Combat system  Personalities of the characters have an impact on the game Wide selection of weapons and upgrades Art style  rebindable controls   Bad points  Glitches which aren't game breaking once you know to compensate for them. The two most noted are the tank control going wonkie and the avatars falling through the map. Around a third of the story is just plain bad. They added completely stupid things in some places and messed up on others.  10 bucks is the most you should pay for the game. Half price is more then fair with the glitches and the annoying story bits. If they ever fix the glitches (I highly doubt) then 15.
"I have admittedly only played about an hour of Vaklyria Chronicles however, in just that one hour, I was completely sold on this game. The graphics are pretty top notch, the characters in the game have deep histories and back stories that I've only seen a glimpse of in my short playtime but I know from friends that the storyline is indeed a rich and long story. Being a fan of turn based strategy/rpg games I knew I'd like this game but the turn based system is one of the best I've seen. The options of different squads or characters in their fighting styles are pretty damn cool too. If you're looking for a time consuming turn based strategy game. You've found it if you buy this game. It's a great game and any fan of the genre will agree I'm quite sure.  Overall Rating (based on my limited time I may change the rating and review a little later on.): 9/10"
"Valkyria Chronicles has a very well written story that explores war (specifically world war II) from the viewpoint of the militia. Because of this, war isn't ever glorified throughout the story of the game. The game also explores racism and concentration camps throughout it's narrative. The gameplay is enjoyable and never feels punishing as you are almost always able to recover and learn from your mistakes. There is also a wide cast of characters to recruit and use, all of whom have very one dimensional personalities. I found the characters very charming as they shouted out their various catchphrases, sometimes joining in, as I played through the game. The one major problem I had with the game is that it has some inconsistency with it's difficulty. I found that some missions were very challenging for me, but they would then be followed by missions I would just barrel through, rather than there being a slow incline (or steep incline) of difficulty.  If you are in the market for a JRPG or a turn based strategy game, I can not recommend this game enough."
"Abslutely amazeballs. Very good game plenty of re-play potential, strong gameplay, excellent story and characters."
"the story is a bit old styled but still moving and attractive. expert mode skirmishes are insanely difficult. there will be a feeling that you believe more content could be included into the game to make it more complex and playable, but overall it's already a pretty good game"
40 Hours Of My Life Well Spent
The glitches in the game make me laugh and Marina best grill.
entire mission rides on you making this final shot shell comes out of the tank barrel at a 45 degree angle and misses completely  (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻  all in all it was pretty quality game i r8 8/8
"Pros - Great mechanics intertwining turn-based tactics with first person aiming. - Great art style (if you're into Anime). - Lots of actual gameplay even if you skip the copious amounts of cutscenes. - Very satisfying to take out enemy soldiers and vehicles. Great sound and visual design help a lot with this. - Your squad members have a lot of individual character and flavour. - Both English and Japanese dubs.  Cons - Story is a little cliche and melodramatic. - Copious amounts of cutscenes. - Has some game-flow issues, such as making you double confirm a move or double confirm going to barracks. (Gets annoying after the 50th time it asks 'are you sure you want to end turn?') - Enemy turns can't be sped up. In some scenarios their turns take longer than yours due to game-flow issues. Ideally we'd be able to turn off/speed up enemy turns. - Excessive loading around non-battle scene transitions. E.g. going from squad barracks to weapons upgrade takes way too long. - Console-gamepad type menu controls and navigation. Could have used a lot of work to include mouse driven menus. - Driving the tank is really sucky with mouse. TIP: Use your NUMPAD along with WASD. Leave the mouse out of the equation."
"It's not often that a game reaches deep down inside you and pulls at your gut like Valkyria Chronicles does. The art is amazing, blurring the lines between hand drawn and animated, blending the best parts of a visual novel with the motion of anime. The voice acting is superb, featuring well-known artists such as Fred Tatasciore (Incredible Hulk), Nolan North (Desmond Miles, Deadpool), and Laura Bailey (Serana TESV). The story is gripping. It depicts the small, resource-rich nation of Gallia torn between two military superpowers as they try to remain neutral. You watch the polar-opposite characters grow into a tight-nit family as they are called from their humble daily lives to the seemingly unassailable defense of Gallia as Squad 7, 3rd Regiment of the Gallian Militia. In the midst of a humble video game story set in a fantasy world, you will find yourself reexaming your opinions toward the second world war, allowing the story to open up venues of understanding that you may have missed the first time around in history class.   All in all, this is a game that I can unequivocally recommend. It's both familar, and new. Do yourself a favor: buy all of the special reports from the embedded reporter and play them as you go. Also, watch the credits through to the very, very end. You will not regret it.   'Isara, your dreams live on in us all.'"
"There's a lot to say about Valkyria Chronicles. Amazing story, great combat, great side stories, and amazing character development throughout the entire game. I've played it for hours upon hours given how long it took to beat it, but it was worth every single minute. Once you get used to the combat system, it is amazing at what you can do with it. You can give orders to give support to your units to help them survive! The turn-based system was odd at first, but when used to it, it's amazing. If you finish a turn without spending CP (Command Points) you save them for next turn! I recommend this game to anyone who wants an amazing story and combat."
"This game was awesome. I like strategy games and I like action games. This game combines both really well and the story was really good too. I wish there was a sequel on steam for me to purchase. Get this: + If you like strategy games and action games + If you like story games + You liked games like the Front Mission series + You like getting creative in your strategy  But not if true: - You don't like menus and want to kill with a gun with no strategy - You thought this was Dynasty Warriors where you mow people down and they run up to you for said purpose. - You don't like upgrading a team, a tank, or even equipping stuff. - You don't like making decisions in your games. - You can't read and your hearing is impaired or you find stories to be boring."
"I have not finished the game. Yet i love it. Why?   First up is the one negative i have about the game. Which is something i did not know or find out about until later after i bought it and started to notice something off. The game slowed down, horribly, sometimes. I found out that it suffered an issue similar to a need for speed game i had seen around. Now what happens in VC, is that when the frame rate goes above 30, the game slows down for some reason, i do not know why. I do know that to rectify this, turn Vsync on and just live with 30FPS, it will not kill you.  Secondly, the story, one of the best positives of this. The story, with no spoilers at all, is fantastic if you give it time to get rolling, also helps that its fairly cool too.  Thirdly, graphics. A minor gripe is there are not very many settings, but there are enough to keep it tolerable. BUT, major but, this is one of the reasons i love this game. The graphics are beautiful for its style. It all looks hand drawn and detailed and really really good. I love it.  Fourth, and probably final. Gameplay. Seemingly simple, little difficult in practice. But, do not fear, for all of you who want a good challenge, give VC a go. It has some tricky moments and can occasionally require some thought at the very, very least for all you veterans out there.  Final verdict: 9/10. I will probably update when i finish, but its one of the most enjoyable games i've had the pleasure to play, its difficult enough to keep me challenged, it's got a good story, and to top it off, to make me extremely happy, it features a fantastic art style. That runs on an office laptop.7  Edit #1: Dont do the 'Edy Detatchment' DLC, its ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. And has effectively ruined my time with the game as i no longer want to see what other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t crops up as i continue.  Edit #2: Minus the Edy Detatchment DLC, the game is brilliant....And i have returned to playing and enjoying it.  Edit #3: all the people complaining this game has difficulty spikes are right. I am so sick of it at this point that i have purged it from my system and it will NEVER return, there is no trace of it. And it will stay that way. I recommend anyone with a functioning brain stays as far from this god damn mess as humanly possible. It really is not worth your time."
"Valkyria Chronicles is amazing and very unique game with beautiful art style:  - The port was very well made. - Very good story (its a fun take on ww2 and ww1) and characters. - Talking about them, the game have lots of charming characters with dinamic personalities which affect them on the field. - Amazing combat system, mixing both turn base strategy (and even a bit of wargames, since it somewhat uses activation rules) and a bit of fps.  "
"damn this game is great. fantastic port, hard as hell, and the art is fantastic. gameplay on point too."
"Despite it being set during a world war, this game shines through it's story-telling rather combat. By far a great emotionally crafted story to tug on heart strings when needed. However this is not to say that the combat is sub-par in comparison. It can be varied due to others opinons but combat has a Fire Emblem-esque feel to it but also blends third person shooter mechanics smoothly. I will say however that the game doesn't bring out certain situations to its full potential, which I feel (thankfully) the anime covers in its stead. With that being said if you do play the game, I would highly recommend to watch the anime to gain the full experience out of each chapter."
"A decent movie about anime teenagers going to war, sometimes interrupted by 20 minutes of gameplay"
Bought this title twice for console long ago. It's a title I keep revisiting playing through about once a year or so. After a couple play throughs the number of cut scenes can get old but the story is enjoyable. A little multiplayer would've been a nice addition to this title but all in all a fun game to jump into.
"I'm not that into war games, but the strategy tag and the great amount of positive reviews had me interested.  And i'm glad they did. The feels.  This is a great game with a cool style of gameplay and with an amazing characters enrolled in a emotional rollercoaster of a story. At the beginning I found myself rushing through the cutscenes to the actual gameplay while in the end it was the other way around. It doesn't get boring since you always upgrade your weapons/traits, allowing for some more versatile turns with more AP/range. Strategy is always a strong weapon in every single stage, so position your units well.  Overral I really liked it, would certainly recommend it as a war themed strategy game with a great story.  And I'm a fan of breads, would love to try some of Alicia's bread."
Chapter 7 O_O
"Valkyria Chronicles is a really good JRPG strategy game, with a 40h+ gameplay time. If you like strategy games with good plot, that's your game. I really enjoyed every single moment of the game. Also I wouldn't recommend this game for people who doesn't have a lot a spare time, but if you do, I promise you'll enjoy the hell out of this game."
"Valkyria Chronicles initially appealed to me with its classic turn based tactical gameplay and beautiful animation. I had no idea what I would end up loving the most about it, though, was the passionately beating heart of its characters and story.  Gameplay 8/10 Graphics 8/10 Audio 9/10 Story 10/10  The voice acting is excellent, I might add, and greatly assists in immersing the player in a world that they care about.  It's true, this game can get a little campy at times, but I find that only adds to its charm.  Ultimately, I find it difficult to walk away from Squad 7. Like Welkin (the main protagonist) explains to Alicia, his 2nd in command: he considers Squad 7 to be a part of his extended family, and by the end of the game, you will too.  I only wish we could get some proper sequels (and have them released on the PC), so that we could continue our adventures with these loveable characters in this amazing fictional universe. There is so much potential here and it really feels like the creators went out of their way to flesh out the game's universe - I wish we could have some manga or anime to expand upon that.  P.S. Make sure you pick up the DLC 'Behind her blue flame' that expands upon Selvaria's story. It's some of the most worthwhile DLC I've played in awhile, even if it is a little short gameplay wise."
"Love it! A refreshing take on TBS with a bit of Third-person shooting on the side. Add some deep story and very well developed characters and backstories, and place it in sort of parallel universe WWII Europe, and you have yourself Valkrria Chronicles."
"A third person, turn-based, strategy, RPG that has a pretty good story.   You know you like a game when one of your characters dies and you can't get them back without started the game back from your last save.   The music is really good and the gameplay feels really good when you accomplish the long, hard faught mission. A really good game and I would highly recommend it for anyone."
"A unique thing about makes Valkyria Chronicles good is the BLITZ system which makes some of your soldiers attack enemy soldiers on your opponents turn and in turn lets them do the same on yours. this defeats the idea of storming an objective without shooting anyone. however I must point out a glitch in the retaking of ghilendio, that whenever you try to climb a ladder on the wall the soldier you use simply falls though the surface and makes the soldier useless for the rest of the battle"
one of the best storys ive had the pleasure of playing 10/10 would recommend
Scout Rush Chronicles.
"It's like knitting, frustrating to work on but satisfying results."
I recommend this game because it is good.Worth every money and time spend on this game.Storyline and game control good.Pratically a good game.
Not being able to afford a PS3 back when this first came out I always had it in the back of my mind as a game I wanted to play at some stage. The blend of third person shooter and turn based strategy makes this a very unique gameplay experience that I would recommend to fans of either. The only real issue I had with it was the lack of autosaving after the battle stages. I really hope they port over the psp releases at some stage.

"I was a fan of this game until they decided it was a good idea to put an invincible unit into a mission who could run across the entire map in two turns and has retaliatory fire that can instantly kill anyone on my team, and then defeat any efforts to rescue them. To me this seemed like overkill, and an easier way to make the mission more difficult without actually designing it better.  Character art is fantastic, voice acting is great. These are easily its two greatest strengths. The combat is simple and fun. I think the fact that your own units can fire more than once per round while the enemy is limited to just one each is another weak implementation and could have been designed better. Why handicap the AI so much?  All in all, I'd say this is an average game for 7 dollars, but don't expect anything amazing. The game pretends to allow you to add customization, but all you're really doing is wasting time clicking to upgrade everything before the next mission. Then you watch the story for about 15 minutes, then you fight. Rinse and repeat. Little equipment variation. Potentials are automatically applied and there's no strategy in how to build a person, only how to use them, which rarely matters at all. Soldiers are not random, but in exchange you get better custom character art and voice overs.  It's a very arcade-style strategy game, and this plays to SEGA's strengths.  Game play - 5/10 - Dynamic where 3rd person is concerned, but everything else is overly plain and pretends to carry depth where it really has none. Upgrades for soldiers and equipment not only are minor, but they are unlocked over time, and there is only one path to upgrade through. No customization, no ability to get ahead.  Art/Story - 8/10 - Please, can we get more art like this? The way the camera pans into a new scene before bringing in the characters is awesome. Just minor attentions to detail like this go a long way. The story is compelling enough to make me want to know more. Welkin is one of the best and most interesting characters I've seen in awhile. The rest are generic tough guys or overly senstitive tryhards, as expected from anime inspired games. Soldiers not involved in the story seem like they would be more interesting than Alicia, Largo, and Rosie.  Overall - 6/10"
Rich with story but all unskippable cut scenes. Excellent anime styled PS3 graphics. Turn based unit control combat without the depth of xcom but you get to POV each character you move which is pretty neat.   7/10
"A little slow at first for those new to RPGs, but picks up speed nicely. Without spoiling much, it is a great story, more then enough details for each character, even the minor ones. A few epics fights and a couple dozen hours worth of gameplay."
"Gameplay is awesome, story is dumb, and the story-telling makes me want to puke. Despite the story being so vomit-inducing, Id still recommend this game just for the gameplay.  What I love: 1) The gameplay is super fun. Its turn-based gameplay with a twist. Directly controlling the characters I’m sending to their death actually makes me care about them rather than strictly their 'numbers'. 2) Experience being applied to the entire class of fighter rather than individuals gives me less reason to throw furniture and start foaming at the mouth when one of my troops dies.  What I hate: 1) The game is TOO LONG. Even the super fun gameplay dries up after a while. Playing through just the main missions made me quit the game long before I finished it. 2) The grinding necessary to level my dudes up is infuriating. Again, gameplay is fun, but dries up when grinding through the same map you already played in the main mission 10 times to get experience and cash. 3) The story isn’t terrible, but it’s so cliché and predictable. Granted, that’s kind of par-for-the-course in JRPGs. 4) ANIME! I like me some complex anime (i.e. Death Note and Ghost in the Shell), but the stupid anime that survives entirely on repeating itself 1000 times (i.e. Dragonball Z), weird reactions of characters (i.e. FMA Brotherhood), and THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP OVERCOMES ALL (i.e. Pokemon) really exacerbates me...and this game is a whole lot of all that.  What I want to take behind the shed and put a bullet through its head: 1) Push-button-after-ever-line cutscenes. Forget about starting a cutscene and sitting back to watch; you have to keep pushing the button after everybody talks. This is compounded when the characters go back and forth 5 or 6 times about making a single point. (i.e. 'I got an idea' *push button* 'What’s that Welks?' *push button* 'I know how to get across the river' *push button* 'How do we do that?' *push button* 'I need your help to modify the tank' *push button* 'What’s this all about?' *chew off arm*) 2) In what parallel universe is it acceptable to split a single cutscene into 4 or 5, where you have to go back to the chapter select screen in between each one to select the next? This fact literally made me throw the controller across the room more than once. STOP WASTING MY TIME! The game is too long as is without this stupidity adding more garbage. 3) The voice-acting is surprisingly good for an anime-like game, but the script they had to work with...ugh, makes me want to puke.  Ill recommend this game, but I’ll also recommend skipping the cutscenes and grabbing some cheats that grant unlimited cash and experience so you don’t have to grind through the extremely tedious 'side-missions' a billion times."
I am reccomending this game however...It causes my PC to blue screen..This is a very serious problem that I hope gets fixed asap.
"It's something different from all the other anime related games, but it's also a good pick as well if you want something different."
Shot a person on the head With a tank shell And he's still standing lol legit game 10/10
An interesting take on SRPGs. Definitely worth the buy if you're looking for something beyond your standard grid-based combat.
"This game known through the Playstation finally comes for a release on Steam.  For being a bit old the art style and graphics are as beautiful as if it was released today. It is stable on the PC and does not need the best gaming rig to play.  The story is intriguing and thought-provoking with parallels to real history, characters are interesting and not repetetive. The music sounds amazing. Voice acting is relativly well done, although some voices might be quite annoying (for example Edy's, lol that voice though).  Above all of these reasons why one should buy this game is the gameplay itself. The gameplay is very well thought, complex and in depth. It reminds a little bit of Fire Emblem. It is quite addicting once you get into it while being easy to learn but hard to master.  Ultimately for this price this game is a steal that you should not miss."
This is a must own game. One of the best games I have ever played. It's a pity Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 weren't released for PC.
I cannot recomend this game enough Pros- - Has Developed Characters -Has good animation and art stlye  - Has jappenese voice options ( Recomended) -Has great Combat sytem  -Has good voice actors on both sides english and jappenese  - I could go on but I wont...  Cons- - No support for mouse in menus  -No auto saving -A.I. can be lacking in places.
"Interesting point of view on the IIWW from Japan. Only for those, who like manga style."
Great game.
Really enjoyable tactical squad combat with lovely Anime stylized graphics. I was expecting it to be a bit JRPG/grindy but it's not at all and the pace moves along quite well.
"I bought this game on sale for under $10 and it has been well worth it. In fact, after playing it, I likely would have purchased it at full price. The art style is cool and the gameplay is unique and easy to pick up. It also has a fair amount of replay value. I'm a huge fan of JRPGs and Strategy games like Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics. And although this game is nothing like those, it's still fun in it's own right, and should hold me over until the next Fire Emblem arrives. If this game is still on sale, buy it. Even if it's not on sale, you should still probably buy it."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a Japanese Turn Based Role Playing Game that is very story-rich. The PC port is good and the controls are very fluid. The story is very interesting which features a military war-like genre. The story mode however, can get very difficult and at times require skill and thinking (unless you search up a walkthrough). Overall I'd rate 9/5/10."
"A very good game with an interesting mix of 'free-roam' and 'turn-based' combat. The only thing I would say sours the game a bit is the confirmantion needed after, I kid you not, EVERY cutscene. I like the book as a frame for the story, but having to pick and confirm to play a cutscene can be jarring and feels like a 'New Game +' feature meant to let players get right to their favorite scenes or opperations.  All in all, I rate this game 8/10 because immersion really is worth 2 points to me. I whole-heartedly recommend that you buy this game, but wait for a good sale."
it's like playing chess in weaboo version..  69/69 weaboo intensefies.. 
uhh tanks and jiggly boobs. Good plot.
"Great story, great gameplay, beautiful graphics. 10/10"
"It's an enjoyable game. The sucky part is that I love strategy games, but I'm absolute rubbish at them.  10/10 would get my ♥♥♥ handed to me again"
"Like many strategy games, this one loves to blantantly be cheep on your ♥♥♥ to make it more difficult, and it only gets worse the latter you get units get better, including enemy aces which will doge probably 90% of incoming fire. Playing this makes me want to play games like Company of Heroes or XCOM which like to deal fair hands instead. So I'm going to go down that."
An amazing wartime rpg with an anime art style. 8/10
"I may have limited play time for this game but I've actually played the second one on PSP, so here we go...  It's not a JA2: Unfinished Business, or an Xcom, however it's a solid story driven turn based/real timeish tactical strategy game, the story is conveyed beautifully, the characters are interesting (noone is a Fidel or an Ivan Dolvich thou, or Magic, or Scully... seriously go play JA2 as well) the tactical aspect of the game is fun, easy to learn, moderately hard to master, also includes a tiny bit of customization, all in all a good game but I cannot recommend at full price, wait for a discount and give it a try, if you are a TBS fan, however if you didn't play JA2 yet, go play that one first :)"
"Very enjoyable story, character development, and turn-based battles. I played this on my PSP years ago and am happy that it is availble on the PC. I hope we see Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 available on Steam in the future!"
"One tip: Set language to japanese, the subtitles are English regardless.  The english voice acting is bad, the voices don't have any impact at all...  I didn't really like the game, the gameplay turned me off, t feels too awkward..."
If you like games like FIRE EMBLEM you will LOVE this!
"This is a very good game. It has a very enriching story.  The game play is something of an emalgamation of FPS, RTS, and turn based game play. It sounds like an odd mix(because it is a very odd mix) but however blends very well in how they do it. The Movement is turn based but combat is FPS/RTS as the enemy/player get to react to one another during the combat. The attacker/mover turn gets to pick its targets and aim at those targets. The defender/off turn automatically returns fire if in range or visible.  I'm not going to deep into reviewing as others have. All I can say is that I really enjoy this game and is worth it's price with a decent voice cast."
Got my ♥♥♥ beat by a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan. 10/10 would die again
"Fantastic art style, wonderful story, great gameplay. what more could you want? I will admit the port is a little clunky, but it's not even an issue once you get into it."
"Great game, although sometime u will mad at those ppl who stupidly miss a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shot."
"Beauttiful game, setting, story, and gameplay. I'm only a few hours in and I'm fully emersed in the story. I care about the characters, their country, why they fight, and understand their relationships with their fellow troops. Don't expect this to be one of those games you just play from beginning to end. Everything has layers.   While the turn based/FPS format is interesting as it is unique, it can be a bit clunky at times. Simply stopping enemy troops from 'free firing' after your aim phase would've resolved the issue. Instead, you can get stuck taking unecessary damage when you simply want to end your turn or reposition yourself after attacking.  The cover system is a bit flawed too as you can only hide behind sand bags and hide in tall grass. (Assuming the unit in question doesn't have allergies.)  Even with its shortcomings, combat is complex, fair, and deeper the more you progress. Every unit type has their given usefulness, strenghts, and weaknesses. All of which can be modified further by their potentials, relationships with other units, and the layout of the given map you're on. One aspect that I really like is that progression is streamlined, allowing you to allocate experience points to an entire unit type. This cuts prevents power creep and the need to grind levels with less favorible troops. Everyone levels up at the same time and when you want them to. I actually hope to see a growth/progression format simmilar to this in other turn based strategy games.   I'd reccomend Valkyria Chronicles to JRPG and turn based strategy fans. If you're both, then you probably already have it in your library.   9/10 (Docking 1 point for the post attack phase blunder and specific cover system)"
"A strategy war game with anime girls that has rpg elements to it, some units are obviously overpowered. You will progress through a story mode where you push a large overwhelming army out of your home. You are outnumbered and outgunned but with your spirit and tactics you will prevail!  The story mode is kinda easy and the additional maps are where the real difficulty is at, theres an additional side campaign where you can play as the opposing force prior to the events of the game, these are quite a bit more difficult than the main story as well.  After the first few easy story missions you can replay a few of them if you are stuck as well and needing a little extra exp to level up your units if you are having difficulty. Making this game good for people that would normally have difficulty with strategy games.  With a charming story and fun game mechanics along with a colorful cast of characters you are pretty much guaranteed a good time."
"I always hated turned-based strategy games, that is until I found this gem during the summer sales.  Deep and thrilling story  AMAZING music  Awesome gameplay   Vyse is the bomb  10/10 would save Gallia again"
"iam an ex-infantry soldier, that being said, i want to say that this game is definitely a must have for anyone who wants to play a game where not only you get to play an individual squad based combat experience but you also get to upgrade your indvidual squad members and also not only upgrade your tank (btw, is a bad ♥♥♥ killing machine), you get to choose which troopers to take with you on each misssion. you play in an alternate WWII setting which makes the game even beter because sometimes the old standard WWII gets a little stale. i give this game a 9/10"
"This is the most Japanese turn based game EVER: anime cliches, cheering teenage girls, epic story, voice acting weirdos, funny and ridicolous moments. Overall, it really is a masterpiece."
very nice story and port for PC with fully voiced conversations
"A masterfully creafted strategy game with a great story,excellent character developement and fantastic artsyle,on top of that,the Steam version comes with the 3 DLC story arcs from the console version already included in the base game free of charge,lastly the games runs at 60 FPS and it's resolution is unlocked. I can raccomand this game to anyone without reservations"
"Bought this game because I love strategy games, not by any means an anime fan. I signed up for this shooter/strategy hybrid but what I got was a god damned feels trip.  Pros:  -Unique take on the strategy genre by having you aim your soldier's shots. -5 classes of soldier so you can mix and match your squad to your liking. -Well written story, watch Squad 7 go through the (emotional) twists and turns of fictional WWII. -Each level felt really unique, the game felt like a real challenge to win some maps. -The upgrade system leaves a lot of room to customize your weapons and vehicles. (Focus on accuracy? Firepower? Defense?)  Cons: -Some voice actors were defintely better than others, sometimes broke immersion for me.  Verdict: 9.5/10  This game is defintely a trip, if you don't particularly enjoy anime (like myself) don't let that stop you from trying this game out. As a fan of both strategy and challenging games, this was totally worth my money, especially on sale."
10/10 killed the final boss with one (double) attack.
"A good port of the PS3 game. Nothing much changed; it's still a brilliant SRPG, the difficulty curve is still pretty sharp, and getting A ranks all but requires exploiting AI shortcomings and glitches. And it's still great fun, now mostly at 60fps.  Not an easy game by any stretch, but that's the closest I have to a complaint here. It's quite satisfying when you finally make it through a mission, and I swell with pride when I manage to get an A rank, a feeling that would certainly be diminished were the game easier.  Not to mention you still get cameos Vyse and Aika from Skies of Arcadia."
Even better than I could have imagined
"Girls und Panzer meets the Holocaust.  Seriously, this is one of my favorite games of all time, and to see it get a good PC port makes me so very happy."
"Awesome game, it has amazing voice acting and animation, great plot, long story, nice battle scenarios ( you dont get bored since the layout and situations keep changing), you have a decent amount of different weapons and characters. Warning be prepared for long cutscenes between battles. I would recomend this game to fire emblem and anime lovers, you'll have a blast at it. totally worthwhile."
Save WWII-era Belgium from Nazi Germany in a tank. Now with battle waifus!!!
"Saw this game a while ago and put off buying it. I finally decided to get it and fell in love. A truly unique gameplay idea. If you're thinking about getting it, you definitely should."
Great game! You'd think people in the game industry would know how a gun is held when fired though....
"I can not say enough positive about this game. Do not let the time played on Steam fool you. I got this on the PS3 years and years ago and have played it there endlessly. I picked it up AGAIN on Steam and am enjoying going through it once more.  A real-time turn-based strategy rpg with an art style that I fell in love with and wish more would get done in it (or maybe bring VC2 and VC3 to Steam!) A quaint story about some recruits from a small little town and how they made a difference. Almost an alternative history, but not exactly. It mirrors some of the ideas and the locations of WWII, but obviously isn't wholly that.  I was writing a couple of paragraphs about the game, how it plays and realized, that it was a long, laborious slog of a read that while it might tell you a lot about how the game works, would likely turn you away from it because it was so dull. Do NOT ignore this game because my writing skills are not superb. Rather take the plunge and play one of the best games of the last decade."
"Great sketchy, watercolor artstyle, I love how the game managed the shading.  Characters are likeable and pretty well fleshed out, including the villains. While only the main characters have scenes in the game, the side characters have their own personality and background that you can learn while playing. All characters have their good points and flaws.  The gameplay is pretty similar to XCOM, you order characters on a battlefield, dodge enemy fire   and miss every second shot from five meters away   actually, your shots are easier to hit because you get to aim them yourself. The real deal about missing is how far you are shooting, how well the target is visible and are they behind cover.   You also have the risk of getting your troops permanently killed on the battlefield. And I mean they can be executed by the enemies if you can't rescue them in time.   It takes a moment for the story to take off, but it is pretty damn good.   In a world of   Europe   there is a war brewing between   NATO and Russia   the Atlantic Federation and the Imperial Alliance over limited resources,   oil   Ragnite, that people need for their everyday needs along with other purposes. You live in a small, neutral nation,   Belgium   Principality of Gallia, where The Imperials set their eyes on due to the high amounts of ragnite there. You start defending your home and attempt to push the enemy forces out of your nation's borders. There's also people called   jews   Darcsens that a majority of people blame for all the bad things in the world.  The story has alot of cliches, but they should be pretty tolerable.   Also, the subs for the game are mediocre. Some people might spot how the japanese dialogue is different compared to the subbing, but they get their point across.  TL;DR  You can order a bunch of minors slaughter your enemies, doing triumphant poses after each kill."
"Quite a good game with nice story line. Despite the system requirement mentioned, I can still run this game quite smoothly on a laptop w/ 64 mb vram and 4 gb ram."
I hope Steam can upload Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 (*^-^)*
""
Awesome game. enough said. wishing for similar games though (not the sequels just different games)
"Do you want a WWII game that is basiclly anime? Do you want a strategy game that is actually quite difficult at time (Try the expert skrimishes)? Do you want to destroy tank with a rifle? If yes, then by this game now. The only problem that I had with the game is the graphics card that I have causes some problem with the character models."
"It's a really good game - that is, if you like an visual novel/tactical RPG hybrid.  The story revolves around Squad 7 of Regiment 3 of the Gallian Militia, in a time where the Empire and the Republic are at war on the continent Europa (in a lot of European languages that's the name for Europe), where the Empire decides to invade the independent nation of Gallia (roughly situated about where Latvia is in real Europe - the Empire spans roughly modern-day Russia) because the rare resource of ragnite is abundantly presented in Gallia's soil. While this stays the main storyline, during the story there comes a second plotline along which reveals more sinister details about an past race which once ruled over the whole of Europa.  You play the game by selecting 'chapters' in a 'book', which then get narrated and animated - or it launches the combat module if you've selected an fight. It works pretty good, it can be sensitive sometimes though.  The combat itself turn-based but with control points for controlling the amount of units you can move, and movement points for how far an unit can move in a single turn. At first you'll need to adjust perhaps to it, but you'll get quickly used to it. It works flawlessly and can be fun to play.  Something to note here is the game doesn't shy away from touching historical happenings: the First Europan War for example happened because the crownprince of the Empire got murdered, akin to the murder on crownprince Ferdinand of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire which caused World War I. (The game takes place during the Second Europan War) It also doesn't shy away from touching the treatment of Jews and Gypsies in Europe during the first half of the 20th century, nor does it shy away from the horrors of war. I can only commend the creators at Sega for this - although it isn't the first time the Japanese dare to touch subjects which European and especially American studios are quick to turn into mindless stuff.    Tl:dr: "
"I finished this game a few times on my PS3 years ago and decided to play it again on my PC, and who wouldn't want to play again just to experience a addictive gameplay and tale-telling charming story?   Valkyria Chronicles is a turn-based RPG real-time (In a way, it's a hybrid) taking place in alternative WWII where you be giving orders to individual, each of them who happens to have their own dialogs, background and actual character. And as a player will be leading, you'll find yourself to immerse into the story before even noticing it. The story alone is 30+ hours, excluding side stories, DLC extra stories (which is free btw), training your troops and upgrading your tanks and weapons as such and if you're like me, you can find out more about your units in the 'personnel files.' IMO, VC is one of the best games of PS3 generation and it is no suprised that it has been rewarded with so many positive reviews and ratings.  Even if you don't watch anime, this game goes well with general audience. I'd highly recommend this."
"selvaria's the hottest and alicia's the cutest,maybe that's the main reason why this game titled as the valkyria chronicles"
It's like Advance Wars in 3D that went full Manga.  Also there is a race of people in the game called Darcsen. And everyone hates them because they have dark hair. Pretty messed up.
Great strategy game that is challenging but not too complex. Still holds up for a 7 year-old game.
Pretty much most of the things i wanted to say alr told by other reviewers From IGN to normal review Anyway like many I recommend this game. Why? -unique and fun strategy games ive played -Awesome story plot  -Unique Art style -Baker x Nature Lover  -lighthearted  -Probably one of the legendary Ps3 games  Hmm This maybe be short but still i really recommend players to try out urself.　 
"Sega did good. This take on WWII took me quite a while to get into, I wasn't sure if I liked it. As you progress you unlock more expansive management options that make that battles a lot more diverse and enjoyable. Once you get used to the battles and characters it becomes a lot of fun.  Little anime girl shocktroopers are amazing.  The tank can be stopped by a small rock in the road and controls terrible.  9/10 get ready to skip a LOT of dialogue and wait for your turn!"
"What happens when you combine World War 2 with Anime? Ancient forgotten weapons, cute girls in military outfits, raceism against people with purple hair (???) and a School teacher / environmentalist who becomes a war hero.  Gameplay 8/10 - The game mixes turn-based strategy gameplay with a splash of real-time and pulls it off excellently. From trench warfare to tank combat, the game manages to keep it fresh with each new map and although the combat system is far from realistic it still manages to be lethal enough to keep it interesting. You'll need to flank fortified positions, use grenades and tanks to tackle opponents in cover and stay out of the enemy's line of fire at all times. Enemy tanks prove to be an almost insurmountable foe for any soldier not equipped with a rocket launcher, even they have to tread carefully around them. Meanwhile your own tanks prove to be excellent sources of mobile cover for your squishy infantry, the overall gameplay is satisfying and fun.  However, there are a few gaping holes in the gameplay balance and most maps can be cleared easily with 2-3 soldiers once you know where the exploits are. This wouldn't necessarily be a problem if not for the new game plus expert levels basically requiring you to use exactly those strategies to S rank them. This put a pretty big damper on the replayability of the game but the 1st play-though was fun from start to finish barring a small number of poorly designed maps.  Story 9/10 - The game is full of colorful characters. The core cast is full of shonen stereotype characters but even so the execution is excellent. Even the characters who are out of the spotlight of the main story are enjoyable. Every soldier on your squad is a unique person with their own quirks that come though their voice acting and even their gameplay before you ever bother to read their personnel file that contains their backstory. Don't expect any grim and gritty war-drama, the overall tone is absolutely a Shonen underdog story with the main character overcoming impossible odds at every turn. Still, in spite of the overall positive tone when the characters have those ups and downs you feel it along with them.  Graphics and Sound 8/10 - The character models and objects aren't particularly high-polly so there are some jaged edges visible occasionally. Aside from that though the game pulls off the anime/manga asthetic perfectly with vibrant colors and clean, crisp visuals. Explosion, smoke and bullet effects are intentionally cartoony looking, not particularly impressive but they fit with the overall theme. Muisic and voice acting are also solid.  Overall – If you like turn-based strategy games, tanks and shonen anime, you'll love this game."
"I am on my third playthrough and still going strong (first two were on PS). Excellent story, great characters, strong graphics, fun achievement system and a nice, lightweight game mechanic. Would absolutely recommend for Disgaea / JRPG fans."
Sequels on the psp Still platinum mad
"A enjoyable story with twists at each turn. Gameplay is amazing, easy to grasp, and hard to initiate. A good fun challenge for people who enjoy strategy, war, and rich stories. Definitely worth full price if you don't want to wait.  [Edit 11/29/2015] So before I even finished the story, I decided to check out the anime. I do say that the anime was also good but a bit too much drama for me. There is a lot of stuff put in anime that wasn't part of the game but I think that was the good part because the game didn't have that much detail with the plot. The game however, has incredible gameplay that will leave you wanting for more along its great story. However the one thing about the anime I didn't like was its ending because it left me really empty thinking that there should of been at least something more to finish it off. So this gave me resolve to finish the rest of the game. I skipped doing homework and studying for finals just to find the satisfying ending this story deserves and even got stuck for hours on the last battle. But in the end, I was rewarded with the ending that I wanted to see. It made me sedimental like anime story should and my hole in my heart was fulfilled after I finished through the last scene after the credits.   I fully recommend this to anyone was wants to enjoy a good romantic story with fun gameplay that matches to story."
So weeb even the tank is covered in belts 12/10
Excellent and memorable tactical RPG. Controls may be iffy sometimes but it is a good port and it is quite pretty for its age because of its grapical style. A pretty good story to wrap around the unusual but fun gameplay mechanics and looks.
This game is a very good game.  I love this game because of its graphics and beautifull art design and gameplay style and its storyline about how war effects everyone not just one person or one country. This game is also fun to play if your looking for a paid game which involves turn base 1st-3rd person shooter drawn anime-ish style game.  10/10 would reccomend
"A unique take on a tactical RPG, this game has fantastic presentation and is a ton of fun if you like ordering troops around. Anime meets WWI/WWII in a solid PC port. Keep 'em coming."
"I just started playing it (several hours into the game) and I really like it. I usually go for complicated games like pillars of eternity, crusader kings, kerbal space program, etc. I bought this game on sale to try something new. If you want what so far is a truly different and enjoyable game with a pretty good mix of story cut scenes almost completely voiced and simple strategy gameplay, give this a try. I don't play lots of different games and I'm surprised and happy I'm enjoying this one"
"The action system is revolutionary and refreshing until you play enough and get tired of it, which will not be too long.  The story is childish with unreal dialogue, just like many Japanese games/anime. I'm not saying this because it's fantasy genre; this game is unrealistic as fantasy.  Also, the voice actors (English) do their job as they are dying.  Overall, this game is so boring that I don't want to spend my time fishing it. I could play Skyrim or other games which give me more fun time than this. I can't remember how I got the game, but it's not worth $20 for sure."
"A game that I think will suprise you. It is definitely not for everone, but if you enjoy strategy games, anime, and a decent story this is for you. Heck I would recomend it even if you don't like anime. It has its flaws and the stroy is not nearly as good as the fan boys claim it is but for fans of turn based strategy this is a classic you can not ignore"
"Valkyria Chronicles is a very good turn-based strategy with elements of third person shooter. While playing i compared it a lot of XCOM, and while i still prefer XCOM for sci-fi style Valkyria is definetly something else. I've beaten the game like a hour ago and man that last fight was intense... And now there is a New Game +! Damn it!  Anyway there is probably 1 disadvantage that i can name - very anime-cliche story. So much cliche that oh my gosh... Seriously, it's not fun when you can predict what's gonna happen in next 2 acts of the story. Though probably blamed on game's old age.  Anyway: good game, buy it, play it, win yourself a war. Than play Spec Ops: The Line to remind me yourself some things that you might forget while playing this one."
"This will be the first review I've ever left for a game, and it's simply because this game was too awesome not to leave one.  I'm a big fan of the Fire Emblem series, and after researching online for a game that played somewhat like FE did, I purchased this. And I've never looked back. Fire Emblem-like games have mostly been disappointing for me, but this one delivers with great gameplay and a strong storyline.  While there are certian elements that are vastly different - the leveling system, skillshot aiming, etc, - the feel of the game is very similar. The differences that do exist between the series are done so well that it was rather refreshing for me.  If you're looking for a turn-based strategy 'chessboard' game, I would highly recomment this game. It takes a very unique outlook on this rather systemized, repetive genre of game."
"A bit childish story imo, but fun overall.  The controls are definitely a bit clunky. Personally, I would recommend playing with a controller."
game system is good story fun i want valkyria 2 and 3 on steam too
"I love this game, great story, characters, and gameplay so great even Nintendo decided to rip it off."
"A pig's mom got noscoped by the enemy      10/10- one of the few games you find out there, where bad guys don't have bad aim"
"First let me start by saying this, I am no where near completing this game. I've had an overall great time but there have been a couple of things I think buyers need to know.   1 The game is slow, I read or browse my phone inbetween turns sometimes, it gets old fast.  2 The tank which seems awesome at first conrols are completely wacked, This gets frustating fast. 3 While realistic, there are times where you are winning then BAM a triggered event happens and you die becuase you werern't prepared. This is supppeeeerrrrr annoying,  Still recomend the game though.  "
"This game is gonna hit you right in the feels. Hard.   + Great character development. Far more than I was expecting + Solid plot. Sure its got the over-the-top-Japanese flare, but I enjoyed it. + Combat manage to stay fresh. More than just shoot to kill. There's a surprising amount of variety to the missions. + Love the art style. Gimmicky approach, sure, but they pull it off very well. + Approaches themes like racism and the ugly nature of war on a level that will make you think, rather than just some silly stereotypes.  - UI is more than a little clumsy and over complicated. But, for a JRPG vet like me, I'm used to it. - Combat controls get sticky sometimes when using mouse and keyboard. - Tank controls are a downright NIGHTMARE, again, sometimes. Just try not to get stuck. - The difficulty can be off putting for people who aren't major fans of the genre. You really have to sink your teeth into this one to get the full effect.  ( 65% complete. Will update as I progress. )"
"This has to be one of the best RPGs I've ever played. I have always been a big fan of anime-styled games, but when my friend told em about this one, I immediately had to get it. When it came out on Steam for pre-order, I bolted for it.   All I can say is this:  Pros  1. It was the best purchase I ever made 2. The graphics are stunning and the atmosphere is well portrayed because of the art style this game has 3. The mechanics are well balanced and engaging (at least I found them engaging) 4. The narrative for the story was great; not too deep, but was intriguing enough to want to know more and not skip tons of dialogue 5. The cast of characters within the game's world are all unique in their own way and with how the mechanics work for this game, it makes all the difference with what characters you itneract with  Cons  1. This game is a massive time squeezer so hours will be drained away 2. It may play at a pace of your choosing, but some missions are ungodly amounts of hard if you aren't keen to detail 3. Attachment to characters CAN happen in this game and can lead to heartbreak if a character you love dies; for me, I had three chracters I adored, bot one stood out the most for her quirky nature and amazing stats in game - Edy. Due to my attachment to her, I was so focused on keeping her alive until my end game, and that led to me losing out on a nice few character choices.  Art Style - 9/10 (It is great, and for the style of game it is, it fits. Can't give it perfect rating cause logically, art will have its flaws) Mechanics - 10/10 (Mechanics to me were amazingly placed and for a game of this type, it really had me going and thinking every single time I played) Narrative - 9/10 (Story in the game was great, albeit turning out dry in SOME areas, but not enough to make the story intolerable. Was engaging and fun, as well as fitting for the world and game it was made for) My Personal Score - 10/10 (Absolutely loved this game, and would never stop playing it ever!)  If you are an RPG fan, or just want something int he RPG-Shooter hybrid range, then Valkyria Chronicles is the game for you!!"
"The most impressive thing about this game is the battle system. It is surely unique, and requires quite an amount of strategy to pull it off in a satisfactory way. The story is pretty good as well to keep the player into the game. The art is pretty, the characters likable and there is quite an amount of customization options, depending on your affinity with certain classes of soldiers."
10/10 would finish half of the game in one run and not remember to save and start over again
"Although I haven't gotten too far into the game, so far it has been an amazing experience!  From the music to the characters and the story, everything (well.. most things) are top notch and you can feel that the devs. put a ton of time into this.  I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys RPGs, memorable characters, and a satisfying story!"
I wasn't sure exactly how a turn based shooter game would work out at first. I must say: Surprisingly well.
"LET'S DRIVE THOSE IMPERIALS BACK OUT OF GALLIA.  SQUAD 7, MOVE OUT!"
"I love the style, the gameplay, and the story :)"
"One of the best turn base strategy games I have ever played. It needs a good computer to run on and the voice sync in the cut sences are a bit off. But overall this isnt really a anime game as you could think. The story is very enaging and the battles are challanging. Overall this game is great for anyone to play, the only thing i suggest is to get use to the controls and set the setting to get atleast 40 fps everywhere.   I'd rate this a 9.5/10"
"Concerning the differ from American &amp; Asian, I may not recommend to much on the plots. Yet this is absolutely one of the greatest strategy games I've ever played. The mode is kinda like XCOM: Enemy Unknown, (Sorry, I haven't played other XCOM sequencies, not knowing if the previous games have the same features.) but a better strategy view. As a commander, focusing on a map is much more real than watching a lively combat from a 45 degree like a God. The difficulty is designed properly, since A rank is always not easy to obtain, yet completing a mission is another story. I tried my best to get all missions Rank A, therefore, replaying a single mission for several times made me struggle. By the way, the translation somehow isn't the best, but bearable. I was playing with the Eng sub and Japanese Audio, some minor differences can be found here and there between the audio and sub title."
Great animation design and drawings
great game but the batymos battle is unfair
It like an anime that you can control it. Enjoy your to watch and make your chioce.
"Seemed like a fun game, but it keeps crashing before I can beat the prologue. At least I only wasted 6 bucks on this not the full price."
good game would recommend 
"Kill nazis, save jews and eat bread"
"Brilliant Gameplay, Unique artstyle, In-depth story, Fantastic combat system, Memorable Soundtrack.  Only negative I've found is the camera is a bit slow at times and they way the move thier hands is a little weird.  9.5/10"
"Amazing game , lovely graphics great story ... similar in a way to Xcom which was a great game too."
Fire Emblem with a side of holecaust.
Great game. Plays like a 3rd person Fire Emblem. The level with the Batomys(?) tank is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tingly difficult though.
"What a great turn based rpg! It reminds me of table top versions of Warhammer and Heroscape, which I love. It's well balanced and can be played aggresively or meticulously."
"Maybe it's just not my style, but didn't like the story or the tactics or anything about this game. The animation is nice though."
Came for the gameplay. Stayed for the soul wrenching story.  8/10 would aquire tank conrtols induced PTSD again
"Worldwide, as a Frankenstein slave, usually at night, you go to nearby hospital or  camouflaged miniature hospital van trucks, you strip naked, lay on the operating table,  which slides into the sealed Computer God robot operating cabinet. Intravenous tubes  are connected. The slimy vicious Jew doctor simply pushes the starting button, based  upon your Computer God brain on the moon which records progress of your systematic  butchery. Your butchery is continued exactly, systematically. The Computer God operating  cabinet has many robot arms with electrical and laser beam knife robot arms with fly  eye TV cameras watching your whole body. Every part of you is monitored, even from your  Frankenstein controls. Synthetic blood, synthetic instant-sealing flesh and skin,  even synthetic electrical heartbeat to keep you alive are some of the unbelievable  Computer God instant plastic surgery secrets. You are the highest, most intelligent  electrical machine in the Universe."
"If you enjoy Fire Emblem like I do, you will most definitely also enjoy Valkyria Chronicles.   The story is not as captivating as Fire Emblem in my opinion but I like the gameplay here a bit more than FE, it's a unique spin on the turn based strategy title in my opinion."
"Amazing, besides a few game breaking glitchs, and meah controls it turns out to be an outstanding game."
watched the anime already and cant hold the urge to play the game too bad I bought it before sale lol
"I've played the entire game on ps3, I finished every mission, every challenge and have almost 2000 hours in the game...  AND I CANNOT RECCOMEND IT ENOUGH!  Now, It's a bit bias since this is my favourite game of all time, but who cares???  P.s: Wavy is best militiaman :D"
"One of those games where you will go back and do the first few stages over and over to get the top rank. You'll feel basically untouchable.  Then you get to a part in the story where everything changes and you feel completely insignificant. A lot of people quit at that point, either because they feel the spike is unfair or because they don't want to risk their Waifu/Husbando falling permanantly in battle. Don't. Every stage you overcome from that point on will make you feel awesome.  PS3 gem revitalized for PC, great buy."
"-looks pretty -turn based with a little bit real time with counters while near -each character is unique and has its pros and cons -you have a tank -tank kills everything -enemy has tanks and by the end, they are pretty op -snipers, scouts, anti-tanks, troopers. engineers and tanks, providing variety -really hard if you have a fire emblem mentality"
"Porcavian Winged Pig saves the day, such an amazing tale 10/10!"
took me a very long time to get into this game... worth the effort. this is a very good game thats worth the price especially if on sale.
"This game, right? It's genius. It's great. Fantastic. As close to flawless as possible. I'm gonna explain:  In this game they succesfully mixed action gameplay and strategy together. SUCCESFULLY. There is just the right amount of 3rd person shooter to not feel bored while playing, and the exact right amount of strategy to feel like a genius when you simply take down a foe or two. It is genius, I tell you, I've never ever run across anything as balanced as this before.  And if you're the type of person who likes to have a mountain of characters that each have their own, quirky personality, you'll love this game. I'm not gonna say a lot about it, I'd rather have you find out what I mean about that yourself.  The graphics are in an attractive anime style, and there isn't really anyone with rainbow coloured spiky hair with a million ahoges, they all have quite normal hair and look like humans, and the sexualization is very, very, VERY (like REALLY) low. We're talking extremely low here, about 2%, maybe even lower.  The world it takes place in also looks and feels appealing; the houses, the plants, the streets, the covers, the tanks, pretty much everything is appealing to look at. It might not really have the dark and angsty atmosphere of real war, but it is a blast to run around in while shooting enemies.  And then the story. The character's relationships to each other are a bit too quickly to form, especially in the start. While some people would probably be impatient if the intro was any longer, I still think they could have made the prologue a little longer and deeper; it kind of only scratches the surface of the characters, and it seems slightly forced. The overall plot is also SLIGHTLY cliché: two big countries fight over an energy source and war begins. A small country in the middle of both those two big countries gets attacked because it is rich in this energy source. A guy (the protagonist) conviently has a tank that his father left him when the troops of the enemy starts attacking his village and with the help of this tank and some of his friends, he succesfully drives out the enemy before leaving for the capital and becomes a leutnant, because anime protagonist. And I still think it is interesting. War stories are always interesting, no matter how overused.  Anyway, buy this game. It is worth every penny, or cent, or whatever currency you are currently using. Just buy it, for gods sake. I would have paid the full price for this game (if I weren't such a cheap ♥♥♥♥er)"
Worth a shot if you haven't anything against turn-based World War-esque video games. (Survivor guilt might be included.)  9/10
"Bought this because it looked like Fire Emblem, I'm not dissapointed.  gg SEGA"
"I was impressed with the animation on the game, every chapter and events has animation and is voiced pretty rare to find this on japanese games. and the gameplay is unique with lots of different map it's suprising that the map are not repeativite considering how large the maps are."
"The unique action turn based concept drawn you in but you stay for the story. After a while you realize that you are often punished in the ranking system by using logical tactics instead you must rush if you want to score well. If you don't care about achievements and would rather play the game how you want, there is a skirmish that unlocks later that you can complete in once phase that just rains xp on you. The games advice is often wrong I suggest playing with two saves. One to go and explore the map and another to load back to so you can actually understand the mission.   Overall: Gameplay and feeling rushed gets old but the story is strong enough to keep you wanting to play."
"I've been waiting for this game for a while with high hopes and expectations. These hopes and expectations were not met.  I thought the artwork, graphics, battle-gameplay, and troop management were done rather well. The game had a currency that awarded you depending on how well you did on the battle scenarios.  My main dislike lay with it's storytelling method and the character simplicity. The story is told through episodes which allowed you to replay short story scenes. This form of storytelling felt extremely jagged and the story content did not help this. The way characters thought were extremely simple. Some life changing events for some characters only got several lines of dialog to settle the issue. I honestly felt that this story was catered to a younger demographic than myself.  Anyways. I would rate this 7/10. Great graphics, artwork, battle system, and troop management system. Disappointing story, storytelling methods, and character development.  7/10."
"A Great game, which also sucks you into the story of the trails and tribulations of Squad 7, 8/10"
Havnt played it that much but i really love it.
"I really like this game. The graphic is unique and the gameplay is interesting. Every character have his or her personal traits and that really add flavors to the game as you have to use different approach for different set of team... For me, this is one of the best strategy game I've ever played. It doesn't feel repetitive at all because each level requires different tactics. Intelligently made game."
My roommate told me off about my terrible tank parallel parking skills as I tried to engage General Jaeger the first time.
"What a terrific game! A strong story and simple tactical gamplay make for a winning combination. Reminds me a bit of Fire Emblem, without all the coupling and babies..."
Do you like JRPGs? Do you like 3rd person turn based fights? then why are you reading this... GO BUY IT NOW hours of fun and a great story to boot
"Absolute Masterpiece of a game. You really have to enjoy the play style though and if you dont like turnbased strategy games, you are not going to find this good.  Love the look, love the story, love the gameplay 10/10 from me."
"A really good JRPG (10/10) :)  -The story is great and you will find youself wondering how things will turn out. -The music is really beautifull and suits right in every scene they made. -You will fall in love with the characters due to their personalities. -The gameplay is easy to learn, a very basic turn based game so even if you havent played any JRPG, you wont get youself lost. -The graphics are beautifull!!! They are perfect for this game, I guarentee you wont be disapointed.  Sorry for this sloppy review I hope I was of some help!! :)"
Highly satisfying experience. Graphics and style +++ Gameplay and control +++ (very unique combination of turn based strategy and real-time 3rd person action) Story ++  The game is quite challenging at higher difficulties but it does not force you to progress or harshly punish you for previous mistakes (unlike XCOM or certain versions of Fire Emblem) so I consider this game quite accessible to players new to this genre.

"I'm not into strategy games much but the gameplay is surprisingly fun with well thought out mechanics. Choosing different units and then actually moving them in 3rd person view and aiming their shots makes for a more engaging experience than if you only watched from above like a godly commander. The level maps are really well designed as there are often multiple routes and you sometimes have to coordinate separate teams to achieve a goal. The art style is really nice to look at but a bit too clean for the war theme at times. Music is very good but the limited number of tracks start to feel a bit repetitive after a while. The characters are likeable and the story has enough twists to keep you playing. Its combination of war and fantasy is a bit goofy but mostly works in a JRPG context. This is one of the few games in recent memory where I skipped sleep on a weekend because I just had to play one more level.  A slight annoying thing is the lack of a quick restart option. Loading a game is fairly quick so it's not a big deal but the extra button presses to do it could've been avoided. I often restarted because when you start a level for the first time it becomes obvious very quickly if you didn't choose the right units or if you made a really bad move that you won't be able to recover from. It's also bit of a drag having to watch the computer play its turn at normal speed. A fast-forward option would've been nice. There are also some minor control issues like rotating the tanks and one outright level bug where climbing certain ladders in one of the later levels causes your character to fall though the floor endlessly. It can be avoided though but it's bothersome for sure. Generally though the controls work well with a gamepad.  I recommend the game but I can't say much on who I think would enjoy it most. Based on reviews and videos I saw, I really wasn't sure if I was going to like it. I've enjoyed a few JRPGs before but more for the stories and less for the gameplay. The story was engaging for me. I won't say it's the greatest story ever but I think it does enough to get you to care about the characters. Luckily, I enjoyed the gameplay just as much if not more than the story. I've already begun speculating how this game could be played by two players cooperatively and against each other. That tells me that the strategy gameplay is one worth exploring more in further games."
Pretty cringe-worthy dialogue. Fun gameplay with a decent grind/upgrade system.
"If you wanted to try something different than FF and is a bit more challenging, you should try this game. You shouldn't doubt the story since it has been adapted to an anime. The anime adapted from this game have 26 episodes (If its boring they won't adapt it at all) and there are also some manga adaptation from this game too, it even have two, yes two sequels (playable on psp) which I hope that they would bring it to Steam too.  If you like to shoot fully armored people right in front of their face while taking more damage than you deal to them, and take down a tank with only a rifle (which is possible when you're playing as she who have the biggest oppai in the game xD), you should try this game."
"This game is fun. For a remastered port from an old Playstation game, the graphics are quite nice, like an anime. The gameplay is where it gets tricky with how you, and the enemy AI can be both smart and idiotic(not saying anymore incase of spoilers). Out of the 5 main classes and your character, the scout is pretty overpowered in certain open areas where they can rush in, capture an objective and posibly kill a hostile. With only one scout, you can finish the first skirmish in two turns."
"Classic J-RPG with a very wonky combat system and the world's dumbest AI, but well-thought out and very detailed. English subtitle translations are very loose, verging on rewrite at times, but the Japanese voice work is first rate, recommend it in the original."
"Incredible mix of turn-based tactical combat, squad prep, and pseudo-real time FPS, all wrapped up in a JRPG version of WWII. With tanks. It's probably the most fun I've had in a game since Final Fantasy Tactics. The water-color inspired graphics are beautiful and make it seem like the game hasn't aged a day. I wish it had been 2-3x longer, but that's games these days."
EDIT: Finnally tracked down the issue with my mouse. The game will responsed to controllers even if you don't have the controller setup with the game. I have vjoy installed so that I could remap a joytstick for the X series of games. For some reson this driver was causing a single direction input that the game was responing to. Other games that I have that use joysticks have no issue. Still would have rather got this for a console now that I have messed with it so much to get it to work for PC.
anime world war 2 starring autist Mcanime and anime ♥♥♥♥
"Don't get me wrong, I've played all three VC games and watched the anime. So forget my actual playtime. Valkyria Chronicles, or VC, is by far my favorite alternate ww2 like world that i will always love and cherish. Not only do i support the game because of anime, but also my endless love for this story especially. The first VC truelly had a story worth tears from a manly man such as myself, filled with trials, triumphs, racial acceptance and the feeling of loss... Oh the feeling of loss. So here are my PROS &amp; CONS to better brief you my lovely players on the game Valkyria Chronicles!  Pros - 1-Story - Whether you are saving private Ryan or gathering your band o' brothers, this is a definite 'must experience' No high school reunion romance senpai simulator here. The story will grip you by the balls, and make you grow another pair just in case. 2-Art - Art has always been a nitpickky thing for me. And when i first saw the game for VC i thought, 'crayons?' Boy was i wrong as the sketched like art of VC was Beautiful and Immersive to the story and setting of that world. 3-gameplay - Ever played and loved fire emblem? Well this game is like Fire emblem and battlefield had a baby to smack you full o' fun. You control your squad, which you get to pick who you want prior to mission start, and go on a turn based battle where you control your characters movement and attack. Whether your rushing towards defensive sand bags under enemy fire or risking it to get behind the enemy tank and fire a salvo, you control your characters in a turn based fashion in a real time environment. Moving around infront of enemy troops will have them turning you into cheese if you mess around.  Cons - 1-A few bugs here and there. Crashes can be terrible so save often.  Conclusion - I'd still buy it if the price was 60$, and now its 20$ so even better. You'll be bonding with characters as you get to know them more, while fighting a war. I really recommend this to those who love anime, fire emblem, turn based tactical shooters, etc and even those who feel like giving a new game a try. This has story elements, but really good core gameplay mechanics as well so dont write this off as some visual novel. I cant wait for them to release the other 2 for steam, and i hope this review helped you in spotlighting this game in a new shine.  Yours sincerely, The Arctic Wulfe"
"To sum a lot of things up in way too short of a review, Valkyria Chronicles is magnificent. The only thing you might not like about it is the anime-esque take on some of the characters, which really doesn't matter a whole lot. The number of cringe-worthy moments are few and far between with only one or two which have any real effect on the story.  That's about all there is to say is wrong about it. Pretty much everything else was done right. Valkyria Chronicles got me to question my hatred of turn-based games. I'm a long-time racer and real-time strategy player, but VC was good enough to get past that. Plus, it happens in a 2nd World War of the VC world. Everybody loves WW2, amirite?  11/10 would question time-vs-turn preference again.  Also, it commits the rare action of addressing the Holocaust, unlike a lot of other World War 2 games.  Valkyria Chronicles is something else, completely worth it."
"A classic on console. If you like strategy with a touch of rpg (character specs) than you can certainly do much worse than Valkyria Chronicles. Snipers were nerfed a bit (three shots and shortest AP; whatever) for balance purposes but overall a great game. It's even fun just to replay the maps to get monies and exp. Not necessary but a good way to beef up Galia's finest. The story is fairly predictable but enjoyable. A bit anime at points for my taste, but overall the world and people are interesting enough that you actually care to finish the (at times dark) storyline. And the art style, while offsetting to some, is actually quite beautiful and stands up throughout the entire game."
"This game is absolutely beautiful but also hits you big time in the feels. The story is amazing and the character development is above par. The game is also a fun change from the norm, especially if you're used to first person shooters. A must have if you've never played it, or if you owned the original on PS3."
"I didn't think I would like this game, and yet it captivated my attention for a good long while. A lot of the weird things in the game like the flying pig that you pick up along the way would normally have me shutting down the game and moving on, but still Valkyria Chronicles pulled off enough entertainment to be very good. It's kind of a mix between xcom, and battlefield 1942. Thats probably the best way to describe it. xcom, and battlefield 1942 had a baby, and raised it in a JRPG."
Good game with XCOM like gameplay. Lots of anime themes which will either make it or break it for you
"A strategy game set in an anime WWII universe with an interesting take on the usual turn-based formula.  It's not perfect, but it's fresh, it's fun, the story is decent, and the characters are likable enough that you'll want to make sure you keep them alive throughout the campaign.  ... It's also the only game I'm any good at sniping in.  *Sigh*"
"Really enjoyed this game. Why?  + Good story + Nice characters, with some surprises + Different tactics applicable + Not all battles are the same, some are really different to each other + Found the combination of short story parts with the battles inbetween well combined ~ To get all achievements, multiple play throughs are required  So if you see this game on sale, give it a try, I promise you won't regret it. Would even say definetly worth it's current full price (20 €). Made me do a full play through with all achievements (nearly finished) which I normally don't do, because I enjoyed it so much."
amazing game. wish it had the class depth of its sequel tho
"Such a beautiful game.   For anyone looking for a great strategy game, with cool characters and an enjoyable story, this is the one.  10/10"
"This game is a gem.   I had heard about it a lot during the ps3 days and never really gave it a shot but I finally did and I'm glad.  It's not the most detailed TBS game i've ever played but It's simple enough to allow it to be complex in terms of strategy. The game will punish you if you take it lightly. The anime flavor is actually pretty endearing, I'm sure some people will hate it because of this, but for me I think it really works. Each soldier you recruit has their own backstory, traits, comrade preferences, specialties. As you use them more, their story is filled in via the personnel files. I absolutely love that. But at the same time, the more you use them, the more you risk losing them in battle and forever. The stakes are high, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Just like real war, you have to make tough decisions and sacrifices with your troops.   The story is pretty good, up until the very end which kind of just wraps up the game kind of quickly. Most of the story covers things about war and other controversial issues like racism and genocide. There are lots of WW2 parallels in this game.   My only gripe about this game is not being able to skip or fast forward through certain things. Such as the enemy turns, sometimes they just take so long that it stretches the game out a full fourth more of the time that it needed. I also encountered a bug in the game where one of my soldiers would randomly fall through a hole in the level floor and sink into an abyss, yet still be part of the game. I couldn't remove this soldier and neither would they die, so they would just take up a slot on my squad for the duration of the battle and I'd be handicapped.   Otherwise, the game is a 9/10 for me. Great art, great story, great gameplay, great game."
"I liked the characters and how the dialogues and stuff went, the combat here is very unique, it is different than any other games I have played. Worth the money for anyone who likes military games and stuff"
"This was one of the best all-around games I played this year. Amazing soundtrack, smooth gameplay, good performance.  The only thing that will throw you for a loop when you start playing is the scoring system. The scoring system values only 1 stat: time to completion. I.e. Can you complete Mission X in Y time for the S ranking? It doesn't put value at all in efficiency, execution, or casualties; only in how fast you complete the mission. It's a bit disappointing at first, but you get used to it the more you play.  Beyond that, I had no complaints! One of the best purchases I've ever made on Steam."
"Great strategy anime game for those who love or maybe heard about X-COM. Prepare for spending the majority of the time u play on hiding ur tank from bad emperial guys. Ok, just kidding. The game. Graphics is awesome (lemme shake artist's hand). What about plot? In general it's quite good but sometimes main characters are stupid jerks/ and it made me laugh. Dont wanna spoil u everything) Just buy this game and see it yourself!"
"Awesome game. wonderful story and music, and a must have for every anime fan. 3rd person turn based tactics, first person AP based rounds, resourcemangement with every unit, every unit is a individual person with their own peculiarities, different classes such as trooper, scout, sniper aso. Tanks with mods baby! equip your units with different weapons and stats. A lot of different locations, callenges and enemys, also bosses. Oh and I totally forgot about the valkyrians..."
Great tactical RPG. One of the best I have seen in a long time.
"This game is excellent.   The game blends real time action elements with turn-based strategy to create a unique style of combat that I haven't experienced in any other game. The battles are challenging, the story is engaging, and you will find yourself becoming attached to the members of your squad (in some cases, even in spite of traits that negatively affect their combat abilities).   One issue is that I think they got the mission ranking system wrong. You receive a ranking at the end of a mission based on how quickly you finish the mission, and not on any other factors. Thus, in order to get A rankings, you often have to resort to cheese strategies or to otherwise put your soldiers at great risk in order to complete it fast enough (send one Scout through hordes of enemies just to capture the main enemy base, spamming orders on that unit etc.). I would prefer to see rankings based more on how thoroughly you wipe out the enemy's force compared to the casualties you sustain, with some consideration for speed (and not have speed be the only factor in the ranking).   The first playthrough will take ~40-50 hours, and it won't seem anywhere near that long. Haven't done a new game '+' yet, but I'm already looking forward to it.   Enjoy   Romans 6:23"
"TLDR: Glitchy and Poorly Designed Game Mechanics - More Frustrating Trial and Error than Fulfilling 'Strategy'. Do not recommend.   1. Too Many Cutscenes I'll start with the smallest gripe I have. Most of the game is wasted on cut scenes. Although you can skip them, actual gameplay is few and far between. Unless you are a fan, I definitely would not recommend this.  2. Glitchy Gameplay and Lack of Actual Strategy Gameplay is glitchy and mechanics are frustratingly wonky. There is little actual strategy as the game functions like an overly complicated version of rock-paper-scissors styled combat; this is unacceptable for a strategy game (explained below).  2a. Inconsistent and Unreliable Mechanics Which Foil Any Attempts at Strategy Gameplay mechanics are inconsistent and unreliable, resulting in a reliance on luck and trial and error rather than actual strategy.  Units that are specialised for certain situations rarely work in practice. Snipers miss that crucial shot 60% of the time, Anti-Tank units miss huge tanks 50% of the time - these penalties do not apply to enemy units who hit almost 100% of the time.  The entire 'counter-attack and return fire mechanic' is inconsistent and undependable and cannot actually be relied upon in positioning your squad or setting up kill zones because you can never be sure if your units will counter or get slaughtered. Or whether that sturdy looking rock counts as cover or if it would magically allow bullets to fly through. Each turn therefore becomes an exercise in trial and error. Summary: Imagine playing rock-paper-scissors without being able to control your hand, now add a blindfold. I would recommend saving your money and just playing rock-paper-scissors with a friend instead.  3. Poor Controls and Navigation Controls are poor with the tank (your most powerful unit). It is difficult to move around the map because the keyboard and mouse controls were lazily designed. You'll find your tank moving in circles, using up your precious movement resources, and then inexplicably getting stuck in the groundmesh while exposing its weak spot to the enemy. You then get one shotted, costing you the 2 hour battle you were until that point winning since you lose immediately if your tank is destroyed.  The lack of visual cues for what actually counts as cover has been dealt with above - but this is further complicated by the fact that path readability and mapping are not always clear. This is extremely frustrating since you get a limited number of steps per turn. You'll find yourself wasting entire turns attempting to run towards that 'crack in a rock' or that log which looks like it could be stepped over only to find an invisible wall mesh, wasting a turn trying to snipe through a crumbling building only to see your shot get blocked by more hidden wall mesh, or even running across flat ground for a backstab only to suddenly encounter an inexplicable 'No Entry' message and being forced to waste two more turns going back the way you came.  4. Lazy Mission Design and Explanation Each mission is poorly explained and becomes an exercise in trial and error rather than actual strategy. Poor mapping of the navmesh and visual readability (explained above) aside, you'll find yourself doing 2 hour 'trial runs' to figure out the intricacies of vaguely hinted at mechanics which are crucial to a successful mission. Once you realise what is required you will have to restart and replay the entire mission over again. This is a pain since most missions take more than an hour.   Example 1: You will encounter vague plot points without any actual notification that they will affect the mission in any way. For example you might get a conversation in your second turn of a 20-turn mission where you are told that 'the enemy is crossing the bridge!'. You chalk this up to dramatic effect and continue as planned. Suddenly you find out on turn 7 that you have only 3 turns left (instead of the originally displayed 13) because now 'the enemy is almost here'. By this time you probably would not have enough time to finish the mission objectives because you had been planning based on double the number of turns instead. So you end up having to restart and ignore the mission briefing which still says '20-turns'.  Example 2: There was a desert mission to cross a large span of open space under fire by enemy snipers. After about an hour of slow and steady work moving meticulously from cover to cover, the screen fills with flying sand and the game tells you that a sandstorm is happening and 'now is your chance to run across'. So you start rushing your entire squad out from their cover before the sandstorm ends - only for everyone of them to get shot dead in the next turn as if there was no sandstorm at all.   I actually had to google this one.  Turns out the game meant was that the 'sandstorm' would reduce accuracy for most units - which generally doesn't help when you have 4 snipers trained on your team; essentially the 'sandstorm' was a lie, you were still supposed to stick to cover but you could now try to hit the more exposed shorter ranged enemy units rather than running across in the open. Which begs the question - why would the game tell you that 'now is your chance to run across' as if that was what you were supposed to do?  Bottomline: Congrats you get to start over on 2 hours of blindfolded rock-paper-scissors because the game neglected to explain this rather important distinction clearly. This was the point that I quit playing entirely."
An absolutely splendid game. The game mechanics are simple but leave a lot of room for creativity and the story is very absorbing
"Nice RPG, menus UI could be better optimized to player workflow"
"If you like strategy games with a little more variety in gameplay, you will love this game. I also suggest this game if you are a fan of the Advance Wars series and the Fire Emblem series."
"Pros: 1) This game is a very good game as an introduction to the strategy genre. I find it amazing how they set up the system for selecting soldiers to bring with you into combat, and I love how they make it so that each character has their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, a teammate may be powerful, but they have allergies, so they can't hide in tall grasses. Or, a character might feel comfortable on roads, which increases their attack when their on sidewalks and streets, but they don't like being around nature, so their attack would go down if they were near grass. 2) The combat mechanics are nice. Basically, each turn, you can move your troops a certain amount of times. What units you move, and where you go with that movement is up to you, but you have a limited amount of stamina, so you can't move around forever. You can shoot enemies during your movement, and depending on what part of their body you aim at, the amount of hits you get on them and the damage you dish out are different. 3) The art style is fantastic. Everything looks (and I'm pretty sure it is) handrawn, and it makes everything ingame look beautiful. I also find that this artstyle helps to broaden the amount of details on characters and models. All of the troops that you can add to your squad have unique designs, and that includes small details on their faces. It's amazing how great this style is, yet SEGA hasn't used it more often.  Cons: 1) The gameplay of the game doesn't start until 5-10 minutes ingame. Although I do enjoy the cutscenes (mostly due to the artstyle), I find that they can get to be quite long. I wouldn't mind this if there were less cutscenes, but it seems like the cutscene-to-gameplay ratio (at least up to chapter 2) is 3:1. Again, if you do not like story in games, and just want to get this for the gameplay, I do not recommend this for you. 2) Nothing. Really, I try to keep my reviews even so I have an equal amount of positive and negative points, but I can't see any other glaring issues about this game. It's that good.  So, would you like this game? If you are interested in the strategy genre, and don't mind lots of story, I'd say that the answer is a definitive, 'Yes!' However, if you aren't really interested in any of the story and just want to play it for the strategy parts, be forewarned that a large majority of this game will shove story down your throat. However, there are side-missions that you can play that have no impact or relation to the plot whatsoever, if that strikes your fancy. Overall, I'd say that this game is worth getting, just to try it out."
This game was really fun and enjoyable. Also has some really cool place names for lore and such.
Susie is the most hardcore son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ I have ever seen
"Really enjoyed this title, it's different to most things I've played before - I guess the most similar title I can think of is XCom. Well worth playing."
Simply amazing story and thought-provoking gameplay. Valkyria Chronicles has become one of my favorite games to date. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves turn based strategy games.
"If you like tactical turn-based RPGs, look no further. This game is definitely for you. You would most likely enjoy this game if you've played games like Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy Tactics, Vanguard Bandits etc."
Game about war and protecting one's land. What I love about this game are the art and the light hearted feel you get from playing it. The battle mechanic called BLiTZ (Battle of Live Tactical Zone) is really fun for me.
"Great story, great gameplay. The turns are a bit long sometimes but that's the only problem."
"Are you one of those individuals that want to be an awesome real-time-strategy (RTS) player but are either bored to death or so bad at RTS gaming that you no hope of obtaining victory. Valkyria Chronicles solves these problems and I consider this game to be one of the best buys of my gaming collection. This anime themed game brings both the story and experience to you while keeping a realistic RTS system in the mix. In addition, I found the game to be very player friendly for those that are not use to RTS playing. For those advanced gamers, don't be fooled by my description, this game has much to offer in challenging you to think beyond. In conclusion, if your wanting to add a game that will give you a ton of fun while also giving you a challenge, search Valkyria Chronicles."
"Story is a bit weak imo and the mechanics feel kind of unpolished, especially the tanks.. But the concept is great and the artstyle awsome! A treat for the eye and gameplay consept making me want more. If you think it looks fun you will probably enjoy it."
"I put off playing this game for quite some time despite it being recommended to me over and over. Something about it being a console port and ‘Yet another game set during WW2’ put me off. I was deeply mistaken. This is one of the best strategy games I’ve played, as far as the style of play goes it is very similar to X-Com: EU but the story and characters resonated deeply with me and I played it more for the story than for the battles themselves (which are nonetheless great). Only a few minor things give away that this was originally a game for the PS3, the port is very well done although I know some people dislike the controls. The graphics have aged well; the watercolor style which permeates the game is beautiful and the higher resolutions that modern PCs are capable of do it great justice. The game also runs without stutter on my weaker non-gaming laptop.  Interestingly, while I would normally never consider watching anime in anything but its original language I found the English script of this game to be superior to the Japanese, the latter is quite dry at times and I feel the English voice actors are actually a better fit for their respective characters. And the story and characters are really what make this game stand out. Games that go out of their way to elicit strong emotional responses never make an impression on me, but this one did. As we follow the story along, the characters are occasionally thrust into situations where they must do battle for one reason or another, this using a delightful combination of strategic top-down and tactical first-person gameplay that few other games have tried. While not especially realistic, it works well and you feel very in control of your soldiers’ actions.  In the broader perspective however, Valkyria Chronicles’ depiction of a large 1900s military conflict from a squad’s point of view is very realistic and includes a number of scenarios that ring familiar to anyone used to games set during WW2 – the dramatic beach landing, an assault on an unassailable fortress, a liberation of a small town, a sneak through the forest to avoid detection, and so forth. The considerable variation in battles keeps the game interesting and it never felt like a grind to me. Eventually, supernatural elements (the titular Valkyria) are introduced and the story kicks it up a notch into epic territory. Few games these days become so noticeably better the more you play them.  As for negatives, I don’t think the game is very enjoyable if you focus on getting the highest possible ranking from every encounter, as this rewards speed over all else. A few battles are nearly impossible to win on the first try without prior knowledge about what challenges await you once the mission starts, meaning you may find yourself having to start over with a different strategy. The game lets you save both between and during battles, however, so this can usually be alleviated by simply backing up a few turns. There are fairly few achievements and they range from trivial to almost impossible; a few more in the middle range wouldn’t have hurt. I also dislike the fact that you have to play through the game twice to access some content.  Summing it up, this game is fantastic. It combines all the elements of a good anime and a good turn-based strategy game, with enough of its own flavor to be unique and spectacularly enjoyable. My main problem with it is that it only took me about 45 hours to complete and I fear the next game I play won’t be nearly as good.  10/10."
"Played through this game twice on the PS3. One of my favorite games, and the game that opened me up to more turn-based games like XCOM. If you enjoy XCOM, play this, it is fantastic."
"I bought the game expecting myself to regret it later, but I played it for a good 3 hours not even thinking of any other games. Valkyria Chronicles is one to surely bring you right into a rich story and also providing satisfactory gameplay that is a mix of strategy and a 3rd person shooter, buy the game like right now. IT'S ON A STEAM SAAAAAAAALE   10/10"
"A very fun (and difficult) turn-based game. The war technology feels sorta WWII-ish, but it is fantasy, so there are some magic things going on there and the setting is way different. The storyline is nice, there's a lot of variety in the missions, plenty of progression and challenges. The game offers a lot, and it does it well. The visuals are also really appealing in my opinion."
"Bought for the cute girls, stayed for cute girls, played for cute girls."
"Nice story, nice gameplay, nice soundtrack. Now, to honor this game, i'll sacrifice a lettuce and eat his heart."
Possibly one of the best looking turn based strategy titles ever. Fans of anime and sure to love the story and characters. A blast to play. One of the best things about the PlayStation 3 on PC? Yes please.
"A great game, cool composition between strategy and FPS, Nice story and interesting characters (the cut scenes are some time too long but it worth it for the story)."
"Like XCOM without the hit percentages, you will learn to love certain units and hate when they miss kills at point-blank."
"This is one of those games where you wished that you could forget the story and experience it again. Besides a great story it is an interesting mix of genres. You can make it a lot of fun by making the whole squad consist out of girls (except for your tank(s) and an occasional forced anti-tank unit) and enjoying the victory poses after each kill.  The game does have three weak spots but the first two are not such a big issue. The first is the map interface (I occasionaly ended up selecting the wrong unit or selecting an unit instead of ending my turn). The second is that in some levels there seemed to be an invisible wall which made sniping some units impossible from certain locations). The last is the AI, it behaves rather predictable and relies strongly on strong super units. But still can be challeging (the first run of the campaign took me 30 hours)."
Good storyline and fun to play.  Though sometimes a little slow to progress.
You should get this game                                ♥♥♥♥ing buy it NAW
"In 30 words or less,  An enjoyable and rather unothodox turn-based, strategy, RPG whose strengths in its characters, story, music and art design compliment one another, and stands tall aboves its faults.  In about 20 words or less, I thought the canvas border was annoying at first, but its easily overlooked by everything that happens within all throughout.  In 3 words or less, I love it."
Fantastic RPG setting; Overall a great game.  10/10 will kill multiple tank with a rife anyday.
Terrific game! Great story. Gorgeous art style. Well thought out squad personalities and dynamics. 10/10 Would recommend to anyone and everyone I can!
"If you like Fire Emblem you will like this game, there is no choice behind it, you will like this game.  It has story, strategy, TANKS!!! You will like this game.  Why are you still reading this GO BUY IT DAMMIT!!!"
"If you love stories and strategy games, this is the game for you. Nuff said."
"Inovative, fun, interesting, challenging. I think it's a must have for people who like to test a new kind of stategy."
Alicia is too OP after you order her around a few times. Plz nerf.
Good story cant make up for god awful combat and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting.
"Dood omg, this game is so good. It's pretty great if you like JRPGs and Strategies and what not. I recommend setting the language to Japanese btw. And just as a side not, don't save over your main story campaign when playing the DLC that comes with, erasing ALL progress in Book Mode. It's especially bad when you have over 63 hours logged and you're still playing New Game Plus. Don't do what I did kids."
"This game is a very fun gameplay experience for some very light squad based strategy. It is horribly unbalanced, and a good chunk of the missions boil down to memorizing enemy tactics, but it is still worth playing through for the fun of being able to wipe out an enemy squad.  Each match will take you 30 minutes to an hour unless you are rushing a skirmish. With appropriate levelling and a relaxed pace, you'll finish the main campaign between 25 and 30 hours. Wait until New Game+ to play the DLC.  DO NOT buy this for the story, realism, or balanced gameplay. All the characters are single note with no depth. The plot is bogged down by tired anime cliches, lazy writing, and an otherwise derivative narrative, all of which get worse and more apparent as you approach the ending.  The reward system is totally out of balance, and essentially necessitates the 'Scout Rush' tactic if you want a decent grade and the rewards that said grade entails. The only way to play this game with any real challenge is to force yourself to use a scout only once per turn, and even that gives you a significant advantage if you are keeping up with levelling.  One of my requirements for a recomendation on a PC game is the ability to customize system settings. In this game, you can play with controls, volume (sound and music seperately,) and sensitivity (an Xbox controlelr is highly recommended for unit movement.) This is more than many PC ports will do, which is a point in its favor.  In summary, if you can tolerate a sacharrine, anime storyline and a less that balanced gameplay mechanic; and you enjoy JRPG's and strategy games; then Valkyria Chronicles is worth your time, especially for the price."
Manly tears were shed. Great game! 10/10
Weeb wars where cute girls strike a pose after nailing a man in the skull.   11/10 would strike a cute pose again  great game though
"If you like turn based strategy, class RPG's, tanks or a good story then you will love this one."
"Good game, it's just sometimes hard without being able to guess correctly in 1 go."
"Another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port that sullys a great game. There is horrible interface, full controller support is a lie because you cant remap them, the save system is archaic and the developers shouldn't be allowed to money ♥♥♥♥♥ like this anymore. They make a piece of ♥♥♥♥ port that has ps1 style save system and the game crashes when trying to get to the save menu because low and behold you cant just save anyware or have a an autosave feature because this was ported in 2014 and that would be ridicoulous to expect developers to put effort into a game instead of just releasing a polished turd so they can get paid. Common street walkers have more class then this."
Pros- Amazing turn based strategy game.  Addictive game. Original animey drawn graphics. Great story that gets you involved with the characters. Many different ways you can beat levels. Replayability with skirmish mode. English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Progression for the classes and tanks. Fun and rewarding combat when you take someone out Reminded me of Final Fantasy Tactics a lot. Much Nostalgic. Very Strong. Wow.  Cons- Battles can take a long time if you don't use guides and learn them yourself. Restarting a level sucks after you invested time into a battle. 
Recommended for friends and family. 10/10
"valkyria chronicles.... its super fun, i have only been playing it for a short time but its been a blast. highly recommended for a strategy game fan."
It's a fun game and anyone who has played the old sega game skies of arcadia you can find vyse and aIka as recrutible charecters to your army the game is engaging beautiful to look at and puts a nice spin on classic turn based tactic games. I highly recomend this and pray the sequal gets ported in some time soon
"Imagine fire emblem with guns, and if you've never played fire emblem, well imagine counter strike but turn based. Very good stuff."
"There's not much I can add to the many people who have positively commented on this game. The art style, music, story, voice acting and gameplay are top-tier. The intorductory montage that runs when the game starts still bring an occasional tear to my eye.  Look at the review by user ownosourus, (s)he describes the game and the things it does so well much better than I can.  I got this game recently during Steam's end of year sale for less than half its normal $20 USD list, and it's one of the few games where I can say that I (almost) wish that I had paid full price for, because the quality of the game deserves it.  About the only negative thing I can say about the gameplay is that its mission-scoring system (e.g. how much experience and currency you get for completing missions) emphasizes speed (number of turns played to complete the mission) way too much over any other element. If you take your time to move your squad carefully through the encounter, minimizing your own casualties while simultaneously trying to inflict maximum damage to the enemy, you're likely to get a rather poor mission grade and not much exp/currency. On the other hand, if you use the semi-exploitative 'order-buffed scout' strategy to make a bee-line to the oubjective (e.g. base capture) you'll score high, even if actual damage to the enemy forces was minimal. I started playing the game with the mindset of a prudent military commander, and found myself gradually getting outclassed by the enemy forces as I progressed throug the game because I was getting 'C' and 'D' scores on many of my missions, even though I was doing substantial damage to the enemy force and keeping my casualties low.  Another minor negative is that most of the game's settings, including key/button bindings and A/V settings are set by an application that runs outside the game. You can't adjust game controls, sound or video settings within the main game. Fortunately, the game does not have a huge number of controls, and the default mappings are for the most part intelligently assigned, so you probably won't have much of a need to change control mappings in-game. However, when I'm learning a new game, I'll often use the keybinding UI as a reference, and the split nature of the settings vs. game apps preculdes doing this.  Don't let my few negative comments dissuade you from giving this game a try - they are just a few fairly minor negatives in an otherwise outstanding game. "
"Valkyria Chronicles 'Valkyria of the Battlefield: Gallian Chronicles' is a tactical role-playing game developed and published by Sega, another masterpiece created by sega. If you like XCOM. this is ANIME XCOM. Seriously!"
"Fun as hell, does a unique combination of Third Person Shooter and Tactical RPG. It can be repetitive though. Although it's very anime, it's art style is unique. Selvaria best grill."
"This game is loads of fun. Great story, great combat, and a great art style makes this game one of my recent favorites. If you're a fan of games like Final Fantasy Tactics you'll definitely enjoy Valkyria Chronicals!"
"This game is actually preety great, i walked in expecting a realistic world war 2 stratagy game, and i walked out with a giant ♥♥♥♥ing death godess who 1 shots tanks and is invincible, but to be honest, if that doesn't bother you. you'll enjoy the game a huge amount, the art style while ovbiously being very anime influnced, actually magages to look quite preety at times. The voice acting (in english) is like, really good for a dubbed over cast, top of the line work was clearly done. and the pc port while not perfect (not a massive set of options here) seems to get the job done without to many issues.  Really this game just comes down to a game that feels a lot like xcom, but with more anime to it. if you like xcom, you'd like this."
- Anime - Stupid anime waifu ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t - Awful high pitched voice waifu stuff - Dumb tank controls  + Pretty fun gameplay!!!!!!!!!!!!!! + The music 
10 out of 10. One of (if not THE) best PS3 games is now on PC.
I love Ite
"Valkyria Chronicles tells the story of an alternate Europe. You're set within a small country that is caught between two large empires that are about to have an all out war. The small country Gallia is not known for it's military strength but for their large amount of ragnite minerals. Ragnite is the source of power for the whole continent. As a player you're commanding a small unit trying to survive in this bloody conflict and getting dragged into political affairs. Valkyria Chronicles is a tactical role-playing game, which allows the player to command every unit and also carry out their attacks. The game is a little bit slow and it takes time to get into it. Especially when failing a mission or loosing some important character means starting the last mission all over again. Therefore the difficulty can be frustrating at times.  Nonetheless It's challenging without being unfair, tells a very touching story and has a beautiful art design. Definitely a gem worth trying for everyone who likes JRPG and wants something a little bit different, than the usual amnesia, silent hero character that goes on to save the world."
"Really dumb mission with a giant tank, glowing lady killed half my team and almost forced me to restart the long-♥♥♥ mission over again. Lost 2 of my best waifus."
"I love this game! The art style is unique and makes it feel like you're playing a comic book. The missions are a combination of Turn based strategy and a puzzle game and I really enjoy the story.   Honestly, the game is great and it's worth the money. If you find it on sale then you really have no excuse not to get it! Do yourself a favor an play Valkyria Chronicles."
"Command your army of Waifus while you give orders from your armored tank. What's not to like? Oh yea, great port, 60 fps, no issues."
"I'd been wanting to play this game ever since I saw it first release on console. It's arrival on Steam was something I celebrated mainly by bingeplaying the heck out of this game.   A lovingly detailed world, colourful characters and an absolutely amazing soundtrack! Gameplay keeps you thinking and wanting your soldiers to survive the fights, even though some missions can be more tedious than others (especially if you goof up), the game kept me hooked all the way through. It was an amazing experience and I'm glad I got to play it.  Do I recommend this game? Yes. I think I do."
"So the scout class is entirely OP, if you level that class in the skirmish mode you can basically 1-2 turn every mission. That aside I loved the animaiton and design choices in this game. The story was a bit weak but I couldn't get myself away from it. I think for the price this game is a must play for fans of the genre."
yes i recommend
"Great game,Great Port"
"In a first glance there is nothing not to like in this game. It has story, it has gameplay, it has beautiful graphics (not top notch, but beautiful).  But after some time, the combat part of the game gets repetitive and the story is, even though it shows war, is childish and doesn't develop fast enough. The characters are shallow and we don't get to know them well.  After some time, I was playing just to get to see the ending and the story was hampering it.  I think it's not worth the money. If you like anime like games, and you don't really care about storyline, buy it. But it was a big letdown for me."
Beautiful graphics and story. Highly recommended for JRPG fans.
Outstanding art style.   Innovative strategic gameplay that combines turn-based and real-time elements.  Interesting story and aesthetic.  One of my favorite games.
I feel bad buying this game on humble bundle... Because the developers deserve so much more!
"'Valkyria Chronicles' is a noteworthy take on the whole 'JRPG Thing,' mostly because it's unafraid to take its own, quirky road through the territory.  There are elements of the ever-so-common fantasy-scifi-mashup, but they're actually pretty muted overall. That is, those elements are used to drive the plot at key moments, instead of being a core part of the gameplay. Mostly, 'Chronicles' is World War II in an alternate setting, so pretty much everything you encounter will work in a familiar way.  The game is presented in the form of a book, where different sections are offered for information, a sort of mission hub, and actual progression through the action. It's a unique twist, but it's sometimes clunky and strange. It's particularly odd that between-mission story elements are broken up in such a way that you have to manually advance through them - although it is nice to be able to save and quit more often than you could if the presentation was different.  The tactical combat is enjoyable overall, but it can also be frustrating at points. 'Valkyria Chronicles' is not a game which is particularly forgiving of mistakes, and there are lots of mistakes you can make. Especially as the title reaches its end stages, even seemingly careful movement can result in a squad-member getting picked off or overwhelmed. A battle can turn against you suddenly and viciously, and digging yourself out of a hole can be nigh impossible.  (I strongly advise saving your game after every combat turn that seemed to go well, and make as many separate saves as you can in case an overall strategy turns out to be unworkable. Battles can take a while, and being forced to start one over from the very beginning is not much fun.)  One thing that may not be clear at the outset is what the game values for combat performance. Hint: It all comes down to speed. This really is NOT a 'play the way you want to' sort of affair. If you want the maximum amount of XP and money for soldier and equipment upgrades, you have to win each engagement in the fewest possible turns. Nothing else seems to matter to the battle evaluation system. In some ways, it's understandable, but it also seems somewhat lopsided and bizarre - and it's not explained or justified 'In Universe,' that I can remember.  The game's behavior as a piece of software is sometimes exasperating. Enemy soliders are great at interception fire, or the act of putting rounds downrange at an approaching enemy. Your soliders, on the other hand, seem to be quite spotty at it. Further, enemy tank-mounted machineguns can chew up your characters in moments, but your own anti-personnel gunnery is anemic. Your soliders face a hail of ongoing fire, while enemies get a few, barely effective rounds fired at them...from a TANK! It boggles the mind.  There's also an 'on-again, off-again' problem with potential abilities for your soldiers. Some potentials engage with a 'micro-cutscene' that interrupts soldier movement. It's neither great nor terrible when it happens on occasion, but it's a cause for teeth-gnashing when several potentials activate in close succession. It completely breaks the flow of the action you're trying to perform, and can be disorienting in some cases.  Even with some issues rearing their heads, 'Valkyria Chronicles' has a good reputation because it's a very well-crafted piece of work. Not every design decision is brilliant, but the game is still very engaging and definitely worth a try."
When you deliberately get one of your squadmates in critical condition so you can here the special dialouge when you call the medic using a friend.
it's good.
"Spin gave it to me, so it has to be weeaboo garbage. :^)"
"Excellent turn-based tactical game with anime aesthetics. If you liked X-COM, you must like this game. It is a fresh and different take on the genre."
"Its a good game .... story is okay, and it is easy to get attached to characters. Gameplay is fun, though it will feel weird at first, this turn based pseudo-shooter. There are some funny imbalances, such as the unstoppable Goddess Alicia rush, and it feels pointless to explore other strategies since the grading of performance on missions is purely on speed rather than any other stat such as casualties, damage dealt, base captured, etc."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a story-driven turn-based tactics game originally released for PS3 in 2008. In 2016, it's one of the best games I've ever played, competing with Jagged Alliance 2, XCOM: EW and Xenonauts in its category.  Positive - The story is what I loved about the game. Perhaps standard for JRPGs, I found it unusually compelling among video game stories though I cannot explain why. At its very core, it's a romance story between the lead characters set up by a mortal conflict.  -The setting is well developed. There are extensive backstory materials available as the game progresses in the form of a glossary. Weapons you develop and encounter and your personel are also given setting and personal context. -Each soldier is unique. As in Jagged Alliance 2, each troop has a set of talents grounded in their personality. Though base stats do not vary much at all, every character will get buffs, debuffs, or triggered abilities depending on what happens in combat. On top of that, they also have interactions with other characters, making them more likely to assist their friends or even receive a debuff from proximity to a disliked character. -Though most characters(those you can elect to use in your squad) are not involved with the story, those that are are developed sufficiently to care about their individual character arcs, giving impact to story events. -Gameplay is satisfying and challenging with a good difficulty curve. The unique fusion of TPS and turn-based tactics is something I've never seen before and is effective. -Armoured warfare is interestingly applied to gameplay. Tanks require more points to use, but have tactical uses beyond what a tank typically does in a strategy game. There are not enough games with small-unit combined-arms gameplay that works. -References to history are interwoven into the setting. Those familiar with the two World Wars and what caused them would likely appreciate them. -Some decent plot twists that I don't think I would have seen coming if I were not spoiled beforehand. -The game is told in the style of an artsy book, with cutscenes between each story mission telling most of the story. The episodic nature of the chapters give it a TV series feel. -The game has a lot of content. I've played through the game twice almost back-to-back, giving me a solid 50 hours of enjoyment. -R&amp;D of weapons and tank components is directed by the player and can be tailored to the player's needs. Added status debuffs, magazine capacity, and accuracy are examples of things you can choose for your infantry weapons. Defeating enemy elite units and getting high mission rankings will award you with special weapons to use as well. -Voice acting is generally very good. Some rather large names are attached to the English dub. -The music is great, especially the final boss theme. Some of the tracks give me goosebumps.  Middling -Anime tropes are in effect. It's cringeworthy at worst, but usually only mildly corny. -As is common in anime, there is sometimes dissonance between the character interactions and what is happening in the story.  -The controls are generally just okay. Tanks are sometimes particularly obtuse in their controls. -There is a decent anime adaptation, but the game actually tells the story better. -The game ends. To me, it felt like a beloved television series that ended production a decade ago. The ending is good enough, but it's so hard to pull off a completely fulfilling ending with a story based on a central conflict that I cannot really fault it. -Repeats of the good music get stale. -The game has crashed twice in 50 hours of gameplay. I would judge it reliable overall, though crashes can be infuriating with no autosave.  Negative -The save system is primitive. If there is a way to save in multiple slots, it's not easy to do so. There is no autosave. After completing the game and saving, the game immediately goes into New Game+ which blocks the rest of the game. -Missions can only be restarted or quit by failing the mission, which can be frustrating. -Interface is as a console game. It's bearable. -Battle ranking system. Rewards are purely based on the speed at which you complete a mission, it directly opposes the immersion of the game. -The AI is not good. The challenge of the game comes not from the AI but by the mission designs, and their strength is often in numbers and prepared positions only.  I would recommend this game to anyone interested in tactics games and not violently allergic to anime. It's on sale often, and I personally got it with other games in a Humble Bundle for 7 CAD$."
it's like world war 2 but it's an anime
"An unique Turn-based strategy, the plot and the character design is fantastic. Should try this game"
"One of the worst experiences I've had with a game. The intro cannot be skipped. The settings does not recognize my hardware. And worst of all, the game play was not very exciting, and when I try to exit the game, it is unresponsive. I had to ctrl-alt-del to get out. I attempted to get a refund, but unfortunately 2 weeks had already passed since I purchased."
I was so sure it would suck and i would hate it.
"I'm in Chapter 13 right now, and this game is awesome. The story is great, and I especially like that many different options that I have to beat the scenarios. There are some repetitive things that I could do without but these are minor and no more than what you would expect in its genre. The combat is cool and involves some luck but not too much.   It has one small gameplay knock: Some of these batles have challenges that pretty much mean you are dead if you do not know about them in advance. You'll be hard-pressed to get top ratings on any mission the first time through...when doing it again and knowing what will happen plot-wise or where certain things are hidden the game becomes substantially easier. There are 1-2 missions where it just seemed to me like 'I had to die once first to see how the mechanic of this level worked and then beat it on the 2nd try.'  On the whole, if you like turn-based combat of the Fire Emblem style (though it's much more open and multiple than FE's grid system) you will probably love this game."
"What starts out as a very humane and uncompromising depiction of war slowly spirals out of control into anime nonsense. Still, the gameplay is great. As the story collapses, the gameplay only gets better. So even if you find the story to be a dissapointment, there's a lot to enjoy with this simple yet complex combat system.  So do I recommend this game? Only for a specific audience - People dying for turn-based strategy RPG mixed with cover-based third person shooting.  If you need that very specific itch scratched, this ones for you."
"I love games with unconventional type of gameplay. This one's formula is unique in it's own way which makes the game even more enjoyable. If I were to compare it to something it would be closest to a 3D worms game but it still differs. Sadly there is no multiplayer.  Most of the game is some kind of story telling with battles mixed in. The story telling parts are crucial for understanding the story and having fun troughout the gameplay. The anime touch and different kind of graphics is also for a plus.  I recommend using the Gallian Crossfire mod for even more fun playtrough as the base game has it's flaws (rank is based on amount of turns not enemies killed/classes are unbalanced). I in about 10 hours of playing the game I myself discovered a technique which breaks the game - on internet it's known as scout rush. In short, you just have to rush the enemy base with one scout and capture the flag. It doesn't matter if you kill enemy soldiers and you can usually do it in one turn which awards you the highest rank. The mentioned mod makes the game more balanced."
"Neither the story nor the gameplay are perfect (no game has that) but honestly buy and play this wonderful game, you won't regret it.   Not only you will have a lot of fun with it (the mix of elements from different genres is really great, despite sometimes being a lil clunky), but you will also actually get to care about the characters (all the units in your squad have a unique back story, atributes and personality, which makes you care for every single soldier you bring to the battlefield, specially if you add permadeath to the mix) and plot (that had some shocking and very touching moments for me), you will also enjoy its perfect anime style and soundtrack.  In case you didn't get the message: Buy and play this wonderful game, it's a true gem indeed that will stay in your mind and soul for a long time."
"Great port, and even better game! (Anime+xcom, but I like it more then xcom)"
"So far, great game. Perfect balance between story cutscenes and combat sequences. As fan of anime in general i can recommend it. As fan of war games (board games/minature games) I can recommend it.   Poor Oscar, he's only 15 and already he took 2 mortar shells to the face. But dont worry hes OK. :)   EDIT: Finally found time to finish this title. Great story with 2 major plotholes. But In general it is good story.  Gameplay wise... good one, but i wish they would nerf Scouts as you end up runnig with Alicia and top end gun, and KO ing all your enemies. Even Rosie/Vyse with Rhum are subpar to Alicia. You will get attached to characters fast enough to care if they survive battle or not.   Recommended for all manga/anime fans.  Recommended for tactical games fans.  Recommended for anime haters - you will become anime fan after this one.  Recommended for those who have few bucks to spend and time to kill."
"Hi there, Since I saw a good deal of this game (75% off), I've bought it and I've loved it and damn hated so far lol.  *PROS:  Nice graphic. Not so good to be compared with any kind of PS4 or XBOX games but gorgeous enough to be put among side with anime films. Well mixed of colors and uniform designs leads this game to reality looking and fanservice looking (consider those hair styles are piece of irritating in army but serve well to anime lover's eyes). Firing and attack animation as well as injured and dead moments look just so real and somehow ridiculous (especially foot soldiers take shots in da heads, they fall back violently and land to somewhere too far away from their original positions, they'll be brought back and the 'blink-blink' effect even though they are dead; there is a character named Rossie, when she got shot by a rain of bullet, she shakes her body violently and u must meet in ur eyes to know what I mean hahaha).  Nice story lines: I dont if ppl care about those cutscenes but I do care. The way everything organized is so detailed and well mixed in term of history and fantasy. There are conflicts about energy, races, discrimination, winners write history as part of reality and superpower belong to a rare race as part of fantasy.  Curiousity awakening: U r walking to the game and discovering more and more things, get contents updated once u walk closer and u wont stop ur steps after u throw urself to the game. *CONS: alright, behold the complaint as I'm a kiddy boy who always whine and cry (lol T_T)  Choosing which ones r gonna fight for u: before u begin ur mission, u'll be choosing some of many of all possible kinds of soldiers to fight for. Those missions will require u to have appropriate number of kind of soldiers to bring an 'A' score. Imagine ur doing very well so far and realize that u need another specific (I'm not gonna be a spoiler) kind of soldier or u need somebody fix ur tank but u didnt enlist him/her to the line up, reset the mission is the most possitive choice for urself. Yea, u wasted ur time and hope - welcome to the irritating moments lol.  Reset the game: now I'm talking about this very primary but easy to forget thing. Once u want to reset a damn mission, u dont have any button to do the job. U gotta remember to save the game frequently. If u forget to do that, u'll have to restart the entire game back to episode 1 or come way back to where u were. The optimistic dicision is about to suicide ur core soldier (mostly the commander) to end the mission and do it again.  Aiming: dont want to recall cuz it's a pain in da butt T_T. Well, consider it's like real life. Nobody can launch the bullet right into the matter that supposed to be in the middle of circle aiming scope. And this game is about to be like that. If u like Call of Duty or any kind of gun bang bang games, this is not for u (especially u love to be a sniper in game).  Imbalance: there are some kind of soldiers (I started to make it 'skfs' stands for some kind of soldiers) and too useful and be needed to every single battle and some are needed to be in 1 or 2 mission(s). With a buff of defense or attack, that one becomes god of war (the thing is: what da buff is and what da soldier is and what da mission is, the answer is yours).  Medic: she'll charge to the injured soldier even though there r a lot of enemies facing to the her without any catch of damage and bring him/her out of the map once the condition to summon her is met. I'm not talking about the imba of that angel. I'm talking about it looks ridiculous to me lol. Overall, a good game to play and an irritation test awaiting u to discover. I myself love it, I love the irritation too since it's more real than most of game that require of some seconds to locate the reset button and press on it if u dont feel like ur playing the mission well or 'simply' aim the da head and bang and headshot with 1 bullet.   "
"*CAUTIOUS recommendation*  It's really easy to recommend this game if you like anime, and don't mind everything that comes with traditional Japanese game design - archetypal characters, long-winded exposition, fairly slow gameplay, and some anime tropes and cliches (although VC does a good job at not going overboard with those).  Now, I did not finish the game precisely because *everything* in Valkyria Chronicles takes about twice as long as it should. The story bits drag on and only occasionally bring something interesting to the table, and the turn-based combat - as good as it is - has no speedup option, which it really needs in my opinion. Each mission can take up to an hour and a half if you tend to take your time and if you screw up, it can be an hour of progress that isn't that much fun getting back. I'm guessing that I'm roughly two thirds in, but I can't bring myself to finish it, because so much about it feels like a chore.  The game is pretty, it is littered with gorgeous understated designs, it has some fun likeable characters (even if the protagonist is a real bore), and the battle mechanics are solid. The third person view really adds to the experience and there are some pretty exciting scenarios. However, chances are that you are also at that point in your life when you say to yourself that life is too short to be playing JRPGs."
"This is a must play game for people who like anime style games and strategy games in general. The reason being because it is so unique, it is a turn based strategy that lets you control units as one would in a third-person shooter with one action and limited movment per selection and it is super fun.  It also has a very unique artstyle which is best described as playing in a painting, it realy lends itself well between cutcenes and gameplay looking very alike (except for speciall cases). The backgrounds are the only thing that sometimes didn't look good but the characters always looks great. Overall i can barely see it was made in 2008.  The characters themselves are great and the game has a good story that is played out in bookform. Actually the whole game is played from a book. You looking att cutcenes and choose missions to progress in the book which i think adds to the art. The main characters gets plenty of development and individual arcs that add to it, the vilians some but not all got enough in my opinion. The recruitabel characters don't get any in-story recognition but there is enough personality there so you dont want them to die (they have a permadeath system for them) and there is also a tab where you can read a bit about all the characters in the game. There are tabs for reading something small about most things which is awesome.  The story itself is realy good and the only bad thing was the final boss but that got destroyed by the ending and then some. It is a different telling of world war two (heavily based on it) set in a alternate universe that house a special mineral that has extremely many uses (used in everything). You play as a militian squad in a small country trapped in the middle of this war and you have to try and save it. Granted you are led by this story and it is straight forward no choosing here. But is done really well.   The soundtrack is really powerfull and really gets you in the right mood, not to many tracks but the ones that are stay in your mind a while.  This is a ported ps3 title hence why it came to pc 2014, but it is a good port, one bug that might happen at a starting point in the game was the only problem i encountered and i think the controlls while odd at first suits the game. While at it the english in the game is good for all major characters, there are just some of the recruits that sound a bit odd.  As i told you in the beginning if you like anime style games and strategy games this is a must play. Even if you don't usually like anime styles i still recommend the game, it isn't heavy on tropes at all and is a very unique experience to play that everyone should be able to enjoy.  *Great and unique combat system *A colorfull cast of great characters *An engaging and touching story set arround defending your country in a different ww2 *Gorgeous artstyle and way of traversing the story (Book)  Get it it's cheap and deserves to be observed by human eyes and hearts.  Honestly the only thing this game lacks is multiplayer that i think would realy work with this system, it would be brutally punishing but would be amazing. If someone would please get on that..."
Really good fun turned based rts strategy game if that makes sense. The game teaches you how to play over time and I never found myself getting stuck. The balance of unit types and battle environments really sink you into the game and the amount of possible angles you can put your units in makes encounters feel free and difficult. If you aren't willing to try missions several times over or are easily frustrated by strategy games then you might want to avoid this title but if you're willing to put forward the effort the feeling after clearing an objective and finishing a mission is super satisfying! I give this one a yes and it's on humble bundle for $5 along with a bunch of total war games.
"Game has fair share of bugs, that said this definitely one of the best games I have played."
"This game originally came out in 2008. I played it at my friends house but only a little. But now that Ive got it on PC, I am quite enjoying the story and game play. The graphics and design are pretty good for the time (2008 if you consider that a long time ago). It takes place in alternate Europe, its pretty much world war II but anime... and less holocausty... Yeah... but you play as Welkin a son to great world war I commander, who had no ambitions of being a soldier or even enlisting in the military, but when Imperials (alt germany) begin to invade his home country of Galia for the special mineral: Ragnite which is rich in the soil of Galia (the whole reason for the invasion), Welkin and friends are forced to step up and spearhead the 'Imp' invasion. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys these kinds of games. 9/10  Edit: Sega has announced a new game (or perhaps remake) of the Valkyria franchise, it says it will be for PS4, which I hope it will come to PC too, because I dont have a PS4..."
"♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of Fire Emblem really, this is still a decent game though. Only game where you can have perfect aim and be right in front of someone and still some how miss... Story is decent and intruiging and the game play isn't bad. I enjoyed my time playing but the game has a lot of bull ♥♥♥♥, or I just suck. It seems to get more and more unfair the further in you are. Anyways, I would recommend this game but if you have access to a Fire Emblem game, play that instead."
I can't stop playing it for long enough to write a good review. 9.9/10.
"Buy it, now."
This is one of the more original games I have played in a while. I really enjoyed playing this the first time through and plan on it again at a later time. The combat and art style make it a real joy to play. The story was sweet I wish there was more of it.
"&gt;Thought I was going to complete the level &gt;Met Fujmolt the Edge &gt;Sent two troopers to shoot him in the head point blank &gt;He 'dodged' them 6 turns in a row, and killed them both &gt;Sent 2 scouts at full health, he dodged and then killed them &gt;Sent a lancer, Fujmolt dodged his missile and then killed him &gt;Sent a tank, he dodged the mortar and anti armor missle &gt;Sent two more troopers, he killed them both &gt;He escaped the area, and I failed the level that I had spent 30 minutes on  10/10 would lead a squad of stormtroopers again"
"This is a pretty decent game. The story is good and the characters are diverse and inviting. The one thing that lacks is mature dialouge to go with the mature story. With the dialouge, it's okay, not much swearing or whatnot which is fine, until one of the characters suddenly says or does something kind of cringy and you're then reminded that it was indeed SEGA that made this title.  But, if you can get passed that, it's a really good game with interesting and innovative mechanics."
"Very nice overall,(include: graphics, bgm&amp;sfx, storyline and gameplay)"
"If an anime fanatic rewrote WWII, it would be this game."
"Simply Put Valkyria Chronicles is a classic tactical role playing game with turn base point assigned action set to a straight forward book story telling format. I would say probably top 10 all time in strategy turn baeds games. Though very simple for adults, I enjoyed the tactical puzzle solving fun aspects of VC. It remined me a lot of some of the earlier PSP games like Ring of Red and others. Pros:  A: Beautiful simplistic story telling with a sort of hand drawn simple colored pencil quality. B: Very easy to learn tactical warfare C: Neat cut scenes and book storytelling with multiple sections to each chapter. Like watching a book anime movie. D: LIke other classic turn based games-You have Lancers, Snipers, Machine Gunners, Engineers to use which get stronger as the game progresses. They also have pretty animation abilities they get added. Watch out for Pollen. E: Some challenging battles that you can either overwhelm or out manuever the enemy. F: Teaches the children the costs of war. I would caution supervision with younger age groups. Follow the rating. Cons 1. AI is too crude and not too bright here which can take away from the over all theme. 2. Shooting affectivly can be a challenge do to the camera movement. Caution 3. Though beutifully done. The animation may not be what your used to and may seem crude to today's animated polished cut scenes and games. That is however my subjective take. 4. Full rosters not necessary to mission completions which is a turn off OVERALL First remember this game is 7 years old. I would advice three things A: Go to the workshop and watch others or see videos and see if this is for you. You don't like tactical games or turn based, pass. B: Wait till on sale to buy, Know that a new Valkyria Azure Revolution is coming in 2017 to PC, and rumors of VC 2 and 3 coming out in a condensed format for PC after, so sooner of later you will probably add this if you like the new game. Not a bad addition if 50-75% off. C: Avoid cheats of this game since there are plenty of how to videos to get past battles. A mistake. It will take away alot of the fun of figuring it out yourself.  I recommend Valkyria Chronicles and a great addition to Strategy lovers. I rate it 3.5 out of 5 stars"
Loved the gameplay. Loved the plot. Loved the ending. Loved Selvaria. T_T
Its really hard and I ♥♥♥♥ing hate it. For masochists.
"+ Great gameplay that blends turn-based strategy with 3rd person real-time action mechanics. + Has one of the best game+ modes I have ever seen. For all of you completionists out there. - Cringeworthy story and very childish characters. Almost unbearable at times (since I am not into anime or manga at all. If you are, that's cool ^^). + That suddenly deals with very adult topics at times.  If you like turn-based games, go ahead and try it!"
"Amazing game, amazing port, for an amazing price."
Awesome game! The only single player game that I felt like playing again after beating it.
A beautiful game.  Best anime I ever played.
A truly beautiful &amp; enjoyable game!  +Story +BattleGameplay +Characters  +Strategic&amp;fun +GraphicsWithMods.4KSupport +Beautiful.User.Interface  Play it ; - ; I'm in love with this game!
I love this goofy thing &lt;3
"This is a fun tun-based combat game set in an alternate universe WW2. Rather than using a grid for the turn-based action, you switch to a first/third person mode on the battlefield for each characters movemet/action phase, choosing who to move and how often to move them with your limited action points.   The game doesn't always do a great job of explaining its mechanics, so a lot of it you won't get until you've played 5 or 6 missions and gotten a chance to mess around. There are also a few missions that, unless you look up strategies online first, you won't be able to do well on the first time through. Also, the overall length of the story mode is a bit short, and you don't unlock a lot of the free play options and side missions from the DLC until you've finished it.  All that said, it's a fun game if you like fire-emblem style combat and don't mind a new and interesting take on how to implement that on a full 3d battlefield while staying turn-based. The upgrade system gets to be really fun around the midpoint of the game, especially if you pick a favorite unit or two and rank them way up early by re-playing the missions for extra xp. And once you have unlocked everything, replaying old missions or the side missions with all your units fully upgraded feels amazing, and gives you a real sense of how far you've come.  7/10"
"After a hard battle in Ch.11 i got an allergy and i started sweating out of my Eyes, even though i watched the Anime i wasn't prepared for this. I can't finish the game."
"Beautiful storyline, amazing cutscenes, fabulous game mechanics. Waiting for Valkyria Chronicles 2, considering there is one. 10/10"
"Love the game, hate the tank movement controls"
"From what I've played of this game it is amazing. Great characters and story. Fun yet challenging gameplay. Edy. What else do you need in a game? Though not the best game for people looking for fast paced shooters, the game is still very fun and rewarding. I would highly recommend if you are willing to put the time in."
"People who say you can just run scouts on operations are the ones who don't enjoy this game at all. Don't spam scouts if you were to plaay this game, just enjoy the game and have fun with the story mode.   The few that give a thumbs down for this game probably have dyslexia, you have to understand that this game is from japan and their language can shorten a long american paragraph into a few short lines while using the correct kanji. And another thing, don't rush this game, you can get a lot more frustrated and bored if you continue to rush through it, there wouldn't be any time for you to explore and find other ways to win an operation. Gaining a victory on an operation means that you have to use all of your unit's classes to their extent and NOT be biased to one, cough* (scouts). You really need to use all the classes for each operation, not only in the beginning because you can just use a few troops to start off so you wouldn't have to use up a lot of turns and deal casualties from the very start, you can just call in more units when you capture an enemy camp.   One more thing, the lines are cheesy, but try to understand that you are listening to the english dub and sub version, which has really bad translation from the japanese language. Makes it a lot less exciting"
Great story and gameplay. Would love to see the sequels ported to pc.
A good port and game.
"This is a fun pseudo-turn based strategy game that is very heavy on story. Selecting a unit, lining up a shot, using different weapons, and using skills are all turn based with a set number of action points. In an odd twist moment happens in real time; so as you're moving your unit into position you're being shot at continuously and you have to very quickly decide where to go and then mash that action button to freeze time before you die. Beyond that this game ticks all the turn-based tactics boxes. There's unit classes, expierence, and skills. New weapons to capture and research. New global commander abilities to learn (like in Advance Wars). Then finally there's the story. There's a movie's worth of pre-rendered cut scenes in this game and enough text backstory to fill a novel. The more you use a unit the more you learn about them and it fills out this encyclopedia in between battles. If you're looking for a Final Fantasy Tactics level of story, this is the game for you. Graphics, art-style, and music are all top-notch."
"This is a cool anime strategy game. The story elements have their good and bad points, I'm on chapter 15 and the end game seems to be more interesting the mid game was. Battles in the latter half of the game can take hours and I've often saved in the middle of a battle so that I can come back and finish it another day. There is replay value to the game as you can go back and play battles over on harder difficulties. One thing did about ruin the game for me; tanks struggle to get up steep grades, this hasn't been a mission ending problem yet but chapter 13 may have been easier if my main tank hadn't have gotten stuck in a hole that I was told to drive in to by the commander. Lastly the A.I. is pretty smart at times, some things the A.I. does may seem really dumb but if you make a mistake or leave a unit out of cover the A.I. will make you pay for it, almost everytime!  Pros;  Long and very detailed anime storyline Enjoyable stratagy third person shooter mixture Upgradable weapons/ armor and tanks Replayable battles intelligent A.I.  Cons; Tanks struggle with steep hills Controls can be a bit of a headache, mainly when backing up a tank or trying to move in cover."
"Thoroughly enjoyed this game as both a JRPG and a Turn Based Strategy game. The visuals are stunning despite the games age, the story is engaging and the battles are very challenging at times. All in all the game took me around ~60 hours to complete, with doing the main battles, skirmishes and fully exploring the story. It was five dollars well spent (during Steam sale) but I wouldn't have mind paying the full $20 price since the game was so great! To anyone who enjoys JRPGs and/or TBS games, I highly reccomend Valkyria Chronicles!"
"I loved this game on PS3 and I'm so glad it got a solid port over, I'm really hoping SEGA brings over Vanquished and the Persona series. They would definitely be day one purchases for me."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a damn good game. The art is great, the story is good, the VA's are way better than I've come to expect from a localized Japanese games, and the gameplay is a blast.  It does get hard, though. I mean, really hard. Part of it is a normal difficulty curve -- enemies are more numerous and powerful, you have to complete more difficult objectives, that sort of thing. But about halfway through the game, it starts getting cheap. For example, in one later mission, once you capture the enemy camp, two squads of powerful enemies as well as two very scary tanks appear out of nowhere. As soon as you finish that turn, they go and tear apart all your units. It's practically impossible to deal with this your first time in the mission. You will die, and you will start over. Your strategy will totally change because you have this new information, and it feels like you were cheated by the game.  But you can also cheese this mission instead, as you can many of the other difficult missions. For example, the solution to that mission is just to place a unit behind each of the enemy spawns before you trigger them to appear, then destroy both tanks with a single rocket each and finish the mission in three turns. You also get 'orders', which let you buff one or more of your soldiers. These are hideously broken. Defense Boost, for example, costs a single CP (unit movement), is obtained early in the game, and lets even your squishiest scouts run straight through a hail of bullets with nary a scratch. It's easy to see how this could be abused in a game where your win condition for each mission is simply to capture the enemy base camp, not to kill all the enemies. Snipers, once you put a few levels into them, can one-shot any visible enemy from across the map. Two of the DLC missions can be completed very early on in the game, rewarding you with game-breaking superweapons and heaps of money and XP.  And the difficulty of the game almost requires it. By the end you're so hopelessly outnumbered and outgunned that completing a single mission without a Wisconsin's worth of cheese takes many hours, assuming you don't just turn it off out of frustration.  But saying it's 'cheesing' makes it sound like it's boring, like running through the game with god mode enabled. And it's not! It just becomes its own sort of minigame: I have these very powerful tools at my disposal, but so do the enemies; how do I use them to complete the objective? It's not the game the developers intended, to be sure, but that doesn't mean it's not fun!  And fun it is, this game is excellent. I've had way more than $10 worth out of this game (got it on sale!), and I'd happily have paid $40-50 for it. The tough missions you can't cheese are very satisfying to pull off without any casualties, and the ones where you do shamelessly cheat are fun in their own way. If you're looking for a challenging strategy game, this is the one to get, period."
Better than Fire Emblem Awakening and Fates
"One of the most refreshing games, in recent memory. Awesome genre blending. 9.5/10"
"Highly recommend, even if you're not into war tactics type games. Story was pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ IMO, but at least it had one. More importantly though the gameplay is a blast. SEGA please port the other valkyria chronicles to PC!"
"A masterpiece from SEGA ! ( Plz port VC 2 and VC 3 on Steam, PSP sucks ! )  PROS : 1. An entertaining and cunning tactical turn-based strategy game 2. Hilarious yet stunning comic art style and animations ! 3. Immersive OST ( Valkyria's Awakening, awwh damn that's an eargasm ! ) 4. Deep storyline and plot, even for secondary characters ! 5. Campaigns are presented in a variety of conditions and rules throughout the game. One time you'll blow everything up, the next time be a ninja ! 6. Good voice acting, both JP and ENG. 7. Waifus ( Selvaria-kun :3 ) 8. Realising , in the end of the day, engineers are the MVP .  CONS : 1. Little replayability value as there is no sandbox mode  2. Awkward terrain bugs that spoil your tactics 3. Plot ACTUALLY HAVE MANY FEELS TRAIN IN IT Q_Q  TL;DR If you like anime or BLUE LAZERS, THEN BUY IT ! "
Best srpg on steam
I love this game but could you make it save automatically!?
"Valkyria Chronicles is an interesting mix of genres. The combining of third person shooting and turn based strategy seems awkward on paper, but works out quite well in practice. That combined with the unique and beautiful art style and the surprisingly interesting story makes Valkyria Chronicles a game that deserves your attention.   On the surface the mechanics of Valkyria Chronicles seem pretty straight forward, if unique. Select a unit, move the unit, perform an action and repeat until you are out of actions. In reality it is made much more complex by the unit types, need for cover, and the fact that you can select the same unit more than once per turn. These simple aspects change the engagements in surprising ways.  After selecting a unit the player must move the unit into position with movement being limited by a meter that depletes as the unit moves. Once in position the player takes aim manually and attacks or performs an action or simply ends turn. This repeats until the command point available are used up or the player ends their turn. The enemy turn plays out then the player takes their next turn.  There are five types of troop the player can command. Scouts can run far and use a rifle in combat, snipers are what you would expect, lancers are your rocket launcher types, shock troopers use machine guns, and engineers are able to build or remove obstacles and mines and can repair tanks. There is also a tank, sometimes two, that have a variety of weapons and require two command points to use. All of the troops available have unique personalities and strengths and weaknesses. They also all relate to one another in different ways, with some being fond of each other and gaining bonuses when together.    The story is a story of war, love, and loss with some supernatural elements. It touches on some fairly mature themes, such as racism, and handles them with a level of respect not always seen in games. As a whole the story is an allegory for the second world war with highly fictionalized elements.    The art style, dubbed the canvas engine, is a unique and beautiful anime style that looks like a moving painting. The models are largely lacking detail but the design and canvas engine make up for it.    Valkyria Chronicles is a must play for strategy fans. The unique game play and art styles combined with a genuinely interesting and moving story makes it an instant classic."
Played through this once already on ps4 and decided to buy it here too. This game makes me want to drink bleach and put my balls through a meat grinder sometimes. but at the end of the day it is very well done. My only complaint is that I feel the fantasy in this game goes overbored sometimes but that fact does't really matter too much.
would mind wipe myself &amp; forgot that i had a wife and play this game again..
"This has to been one of the most satisfying experiences I've ever had in terms of both story quality and gameplay. and for the better part of the last 20 years I've rarely come across something as wonderful as this. Especially for a turn based strategy/action game... I personally think the developers of X-Com could learn a few things from the mechanics here.  I really hope they eventually port the two psp sequels of this game in the future. Valkyria Chronicles was quite long all things considered, and despite the fact that it's so story rich I really was left yearning for more. The potential of this series is limitless, I'm 100% hooked to it and the replayable value of the game is superb as well.  Take my word for it - you will not regret buying this sublime beauty. There's also an HD remastered version for the PS4, although I doubt this will reach the PC, the original is still worth all your money."
"I really appreciated the style of gameplay and story that this game offers. The game is broken into chapters, with the story and 1-2 battles per chapter that works really well if you have an hour or so to play a game. I think it made this game extremely easy to pick up and play one chapter at a time, and because of that I feel like it feels like you are playing an anime/rpg that really fires on all marks. 9/10"
"Game play was fun and worked for what they were going for although movement is sometimes annoying with small objects you cant move over or coners you cant see. Very fine turn based strategy game. Animation was pretty good, although durring the beach scene the character models legs were disturbingly thin, the cinematic scenes looked pleasant. But now here comes the flow of praise of the story. This is the only game so good i felt i had to write a review. FAN-F**KING-TASTIC GAME. Story is incrediby rich and is a really amazing, awesome, i cant even begin to describe how engaging the story is. The story is set up like a book so the progression of chapters and scenes/episodes can keep your interest. But, while the personel section where you see character bios develop as the game goes on makes each squadmember precious to you, is just a fraction of character development! The story has some obvious plot directions but enough twists to break your mind and feels. Gameplay 9/10 Animation 8-9/10 depending on the day Story 20/10"
"For the past couple of years, I'd been wondering if I was over video games. I had not been playing at all, and when I did, I'd start a title, mess around with it for a couple of hours, and never touch it again.  Valkyria Chronicles has proven that wrong."
So glad they brought this to the PC! A turn based tactical FPS? What's not to love?
Great tactical game. Mechanics are a bit strange but after a while You get used to them. Also this game is really messed up. Basicly You are a commander of child soldiers kill squad who mercilessy murders every enemy in sight and does not take prisoners. There is a sweet girl who has a little adorable pig. What is wrong with that You ask. Let me say that on battlefield she puts a bullet in back of the head of her unsuspecting victim without any remorse at point blank range and when poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lies dead on a ground she smiles and says 'yay'.
"This is definitely one of the best games I've ever played. I fell in love with everybody in squad 7 (Gunther, why are you so handsome??) and the story is both funny, sweet and sometimes heartbreaking. The turn based system makes it really interesting and you have to make every move carefully, or you might end up killing one of your favourite characters forever (sob). The soundtrack is addicting as well.  I guess the only negative thing is that some missions are very difficult (at least without any help from the internet) and you get tired of trying for hours with no progress at all... However, after a while you'll realize you still love this game and want to know what happens next, so you keep trying anyway lol."
"If you love turn based strategy, this game is a must. They simpler the training progress. Instead of leveling up each character, you can level up the whole class. Therefore you can change the units in and out easily without concerning about their level. The game focus on the strategy, weapons, characters, and main story. Each character has his own remark. I usually make Alex run into the center of enemies and kill all of them. Sometimes, double kill happen if you weapon is high enough and your aim is accurate.  The funniest moment is when I control a character to go behind a tower to destroy it, he dies. I use another one to rescue him and then that one also dies from the same shooting tower. About 4 times like that and I learn that the shooting is too dangerous even for a high armored unit, so I have to take it down by some other ways.  The game can be finished in 45 hours if you watch all the episodes and try to understand the storyline. If not, it can be done quicker. When the game ends, there is an option to play it again to get an A-rank for all the scenarios. New skirmish maps are also unlocked. Your technologies and EXP are kept the same so it is a bit bored when playing the scenarios because it can be finished quickly.  In general, I love this game and I am going to try the next of this series on PS."
I cried like a little ♥♥♥♥♥ when Rosie sang. 10/10 best videogame storyline I've seen so far!
Made my squad a harem.   Played the same mission for six hours until I finally beat it-but lost combat engineer Nadine to permadeath. Immediately started over from last save.  10/10 No waifu left behind.
"love this game, its like a anime combination of x-com ad fire emblum. however more fire emblum the x-com which is a shame"
i find it a very well done rpg
"I'll keep this short and sweet: I started playing RPGs back in the days of FFVI (then FFIII) and FFIV (then called FFII - never understood why Squaresoft felt the need to renumber them) on the SNES. This game knocked FFVII out of my top-3 RPGs of all time. It used to be Chrono Trigger, FFVII and FFVI. Valkyria Chronicles gave FFVII the boot. In fact, I rank it second only to CT.  Absorb that. Think about how unbelievably awesome those three games are. Ponder how EXCEEDINGLY good Valkyria Chronicles would have to be to overcome a jaded, 30-something gamer's teenage nostalgia two decades after the fact. And yet it did so with ease. I can't remember the last time a video game made me weep like a little girl. This one did it twice.  ... Yeah.   BUY IT."
"One of the best storylines in any game i have ever played ever. the plot twists and great character building make this game one of my top 10. While yes it is primarily waifu wars, the combat is still great and requires a good deal of strategy. by far one of the best. 11/10"
"So fun. It's not actually challenging, as you end up just memorizing what you have to do in the mission and just snipe everyone out from miles away with your elite snipers. But so fun.."
"I honestly didn't know what to expect when I bought this game, other than positive reviews from across the board, and the promise of a great storyline. Suffice to say, this game did not disappoint, and delivered on almost every aspect.  The amazing story sets in a fictional universe, and it must be given credit as it borrows heavily from WW2, and parallels many real-life people and events. The plot was fast-paced from the start, and rarely ever seemed to resort to annoying tropes to advance the plot. Coming into the game from other third-player shooters, the combat was very jarring in the beginning. However, it was very easy to get a grasp of in an hour or two, and the turn-based combat opened up a much more strategic playstyle that I thoroughly enjoyed.  Needless to say, like all other games, this one suffers from flaws. My biggest complaint would be the reward system. Getting an 'S' rank is almost a necessity for the first playthrough, since a higher rank rewards more gold at the end of every mission, allowing you to make the necessed upgrades. However, because the ranking is determined by the amount of turns used to beat the missions, you often find yourself running into the enemy fire like an idiot in order to reach the flag at the end. I often found myself either working through the mechanics of the game or knowing the most abuse you can take in order to blitz through every level. This mechanic is very contradictory to the strategic-styled gameplay. I would've certainly liked the max score to be received from actions like killing the most enemies in the shortest time, not getting spotted by the enemy, and taking the least amount of damage.  Between the amazing soundtrack, to the memorable characters, and the refreshing new combat system, I rate this game with a score of 7/10. I can't fully recommend this to everybody, but if you're a fan of J-RPGs, and turn-based strategy games, I would highly recommend this to any fans of those genres. If you enjoyed the plot, I would also recommend the anime of the same title."
Nice game. Controls can still be improved though.
"What can I say? I love this game. Relaxing gameplay, good plot with some nice twists. Worth buying, especially during promotions."
"Valkyria Chronicles is a pretty standard turn based RPG that feels right at home in the late 90's.   Positives: + Cool theme and time period. + Interesting / Semi-skill based shooting and aiming. + Decent unit classes. + Good map location variety + Decent number of extra Skirmishes for completionists.  Negatives: - Main character is boring and uninspired. - Semi-cringy English voice acting. - Annoyingly Random hit/miss conditions. - Tedious level design. A lot of trial and error. - Unskipable mission intros. - A pretty linear and boring upgrade system.  Massive Negatives: - - - Bug in the final level where you can't walk up a ramp to the end boss if your framerate is too high. This means closing your game. Opening edit mode, Switching your framerate to a lower FPS, re-opening the game, watching the mission intro, placing your units and then walking up the ramp. Ugh..."
"Fell in love with the game until I started it back up. Binge played 5 hours straight, no I am not kidding literally 5 hours, not an exaggeration. Then started the game back up and... Had to start a totally new game. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and not amused at all. Totally broke the entire experience for me. So It was an amazing game but if I literally have to keep it running from start to finish, which i assume would take a very long time with a game of this sort. It aint worth it.  5 out of 10. Had amazing potential but I experienced a game breaking bug. Buy at your own risk, captivated my interest like no other game since I played Life is Strange, and then threw a curve ball at me like this.  EDIT: After replaying the entire story up to the point I left off at and figuring out what went wrong with the save system (I accidentally started a new game as I was trying to skip the intros) Im changing my rating to 10/10."
"Used a controller XD  Just remember, they always target the bloody tank and u can never have enough lancers. "
10/10 Like Worms 3D but with a for realz serious anime story.
"PROS: - Comic book style graphics (cel shaded). - Fictional WW2 setting - Good story with decent character development. - Good voice acting and music. - Plenty of tactics and ways for a level, well-made on strategy aspect and unit diversity - Challenging missions, required thinking, timing, and some luck CONS: - Save/Load Simulator - Gameplay can't be skipped (you will know what i meant) - Tank controls are #&amp;%&amp;#% - I'll admit it, this game still heavily depend on luck (and strategy) like a true JRPG  Final Words: Marina best waifu!"
Played it on the PS3 before but here's a simple review of it  XCOM: Weeabo Edition.  10/10
"I've played thousands of hours of Final Fantasy Tactics. This game does everything right in terms of stratagy and interface. Think of it as live action WW2, meets anime, meets turned based fun. If you like this type of game play, this is for you!"
"I love this game!! One of my favourites. Very unique combat style/mechanics and artstyle(graphics). As about the characters,I just cant let anyone die in the battlefield. Every time that someone gets shot,I feel so sad. The game can be difficult sometimes. Overall,great game,recommended for RTS and RPG players(even if you dont like the anime artstyle you are gonna love the game). Personally I am a fan of anime in general."
"The battle system is really interesting (well it was for me) , the music is great ,the characters are lovable and the story is pretty good. I am one of the minority who thinks that the anime did the story telling better though. I just don't think this game did a good job at emphasizing some of the moments of the game. Still though great game."
"Good game-y turn based tactics. Very polished and thought out in design. Main complaint is the game can be cheesed with the Scout class, as mission rewards are based on speed alone (number of turns). If you can resist that temptation, it's a fun challenge and a great world to enter.  To that point, the setting: a lovingly crafted Japanese take on not-Europe in not-WW2, complete with not-Jews! And yet it works in its way. Earnest, charming, and distinct enough in story to sidestep the usual historical minefields. Could be considered 'dieselpunk'."
"Being a fan of unit-based strategy as seen in Fire Emblem, this game is right up my alley. Haven't finished it yet, but I'm loving it!"
"8/10 Good game! While elements of the plot are unrealistic, the story is incredibly engaging and detailed. In terms of gameplay, it's fairly intuitive (other than clunky tank driving) and fairly challenging. Of course, if you want to be a perfectionist and achieve all A ranked missions the game becomes a constant flip between wiki page and battlescreen."
"I don't know why I let this game to sit on my library for so long. I remember buying it a while ago, but it wasn't until recently that I actually had the time to play it. And it was worth it! Great story and characters and an engaging gameplay, with tons of extras too.  The English dub lacks for a bit of emotion, so I recommend playing it in Japanesse (w/subs)"
Love this game 10/10
The game is fun. Story is interesting and music is great. I just started so I haven't been able to experience everything it has to offer but the only thing I don't like is that there is no auto save. I got pass all the introductions and the game crashed on me during some cutscenes so now I have to start all over again...
"A great game. Its mix of strategy with lining up the perfect shot makes this game one of my top 5 of all time. The story is good, with a unique delivery. Highly recomend using the japanese voice acting with subtitles. Overall cannot complain."
Great game.
"Well, its a great game. I like especially the pre and early ww2 fealing, although its an alternative world. Also the story keeps you interested. Its basiclly a mix of a great anime and turn based strategy game. The game also touchess on problems that we have or had in our world , like racism or ''history is written by the winning side''...etc. so especailly younger gamers get some idea or it can help them to develop some understanding of some of the problems of our real world.  The down side for me was that it was realy difficult to control the tanks on the PC version. That takes some of the fun away, also I would wished more mobile combat form the Ai sides, like in the mission where you fight Jeagers tank. Generally, enemy tanks are standing all the time at the same spot like like pillboxes waiting t be destroyed by you.  "
10/10 would play as a masochist kid and run through enemy fire.
"this is a VERY fun game. i havn't been playing for very long yet and i hacn't seen all it has to offer, but so far this has been a great game. the most similar game i've played to this is xcom, with the turn based, limited movement, so much chance of hitting a shot, different abilities for units and upgrading your wepons. however this game has one thing that in my opinion makes it 100times better than xcom. and that is how aiming works. in xcom your given a % chance to hit. even at point blank range you'll only hit the target 3 of 4 times. this is rediculous because sometimes you litteraly see the bullets pass through your opponant. this was the most enfuriating part of xcom for me. but in this game, its far better. your given an orange circle, within which your bullets will land. different guns fire different amounts of bullets in one use, and each individual bullet will land at random somewhere within the circle. this is far superiour to xcom because it means even if some shots miss, others will hit meaning the turn wasnt wasted. also, unlike xcom, you are allowed to chose where you place this circle, meaning you can risk more shots missing by aiming for a small target like a head; however less shots have to hit the head to kill the enemy. each unit in the game also has there own voice actor which is very cool, however sometimes in the cut sceens the convosations are a bit corny and parts of the story are a bit strange *small spoiler* i mean for **** sake, during a mission where your in a tank fighting another tank, someone inside your tank gives birth.....need i say anymore. however if you really dont like the story and just want the tactical combat in the game you can just skip the cutsceens and any text that appears (however id advise reading some as a couple actually tell you stuff about how to play). i play this with an xbox remote and it works graet. (it also works with the steam controller but i dont own one). overall i realy like this so far and would advise buying it now cos theres currently a sale on including all its dlcs for only £3.74. however if your reading this affter the sale and its back to £15 i'd say it's still worth getting."
"boy meets girl story in ww2.    more seriously, it has an ok tactical combat system, but not comparable to games like xcom. It is possible for non essential characters to die, but it is alot more forgiving in the sense characters only die if their hp reaches 0 AND they are reached by an enemy or a couple of turns pass and you didn't send them to the medic.  story is decent, well worth the price if gotten on discount."
Great story infused deeply in the game and incredible artwork
Pros:  - good story - good characters  - works with xbox 360 controller - decent tactical options but some levels can be cheesed easily.  Cons: - Controls can be wonky sometimes (especially tank controls) - units can sometimes miss extremely easy shots  10/10 would shoot maximilian again.
"This game is easily one of the best strategy RPGs out there, the story really sucks you in, the gameplay is smooth and likeable and it blends in perfectly with the with the controls in a very unique turn-based type of way, Although the port isn't perfect it's still has very very few flaws compared to the other ports out there and trust me I played other type of ports and some of them really sucked, but here you can notice that they actually did it right which is very nice I never got to play the game back then on the ps3 so I'm really happy I could play it now The graphics is also very nice although it's old you can actually see detail in the graphics of this game I played the second game and it was on the PSP it was degraded when comes to graphics well it is the PSP... but here you can see it in its full power and beauty For those who have yet to play this game or are hesitating to play this game I highly recommend you buy this and play it it is really a unique and unforgettable experience."
Killing Notzis all day with your waifu. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
No autosave. And no saving in middle of a mission. So I had to do quite a bit over...
"Originally bought the game for the story, but liked it for its gameplay.  The story is...... well it's not bad, but it's rather light-hearted. I'd prefer a story with a more serious tone. That said, there are quite a lot of memorable moments, and by the end of the journey, it felt satisfying. The members of squad 7 are all very likable. While they're not particularly unique in terms of presentation, they're still the kind of characters that you grow to like... and the death of that certain someone sure caught me by surprise :(  However, the writing quality of the story is inconsistent. A few scenes felt very awkward/out of place/cheesy (especially the romance. totally lacked development). On top of that, the English translation is god awful. I've lost count of how many times I went 'Wait... that's not what they said!' (I play with Japanese audio)  The combat is what I liked the most about the game.  I particularly like how they managed to make every single mission a unique tactical experience. When I first started the game, I had the fear that the combat may get repetitive soon like it did in Shining Blade, but that wasn't the case at all. Every mission had something different, and each fight felt unique. Each was reasonably challenging, and conquering each with tactics felt satisfying.  Mission design is very well done in this game... except for the repeatable skirmishes. those are like... ehhhhh  One thing don't like is how the mission ratings are based exclusively on the number of turns you take to clear it. If I take a more cautious approach, moving the whole team together and eliminating every threat i see, i'd most likely get a bad rating for taking too long. In most cases, the game encourages rushing tactics. While rushing does make sense in certain scenario, I don't like being forced into this playstyle for every single mission. It would've been better if the game can take other tactical aspect into consideration when giving out mission rating  Overall, I think this game is a flawed gem, but definitely worth a try. The controls on PC take a while to get used to, and the game's mechanisms may be confusing at first, but once you get past that, there's a lot of fun to be had. "
"This game is a masterpiece. Now, that out of the way, lets begin the review! This is a turn-based strategy game with a unique combat system. Unlike games like Fire Emblem where you only position and select units to attack - the Valkyria Chronicles allows you to enter a third-person movement mode called 'action mode'. In 'action mode' you take control of the selected unit and traverse the battle field, while in 'action mode' you can have your unit take cover, mantle, hide, and aim for attacks. While moving or preforming certain actions you will loose 'energy'. 'Energy' is what powers your unit, be it tank or infantry. Once you run out of energy you are unable to move but are able to preform actions like aiming, firing, and using items.  Attacking in this game consists of selecting a unit, moving them to a desired location, aiming, and firing, The damage you deal is based on enemy stance, headshot multipliers, and if the have any damage reduction buffs. If you manage to kill an enemy they will fall to the ground in a what I call 'Bleedout' mode. While in 'Bleedout' the unit is rendered completely immobile and cannot perform actions. If an enemy is touched in 'bleedout' they will die and be erased from the enemy roster. This will happen to your units too but death can be prevented by reaching a downed squad member and touching them. This will summon a medic to extract them. Alternatively you can wait 3 turns and not have anyone touch them for them to retreat on their own. When an ally is extracted they can be redeployed after a set amount of turns.  The game has 5 classes of infantry, Scouts, Shocktroopers, Lancers, Engineers, and Snipers. Scouts are one of the backbone memebers of your squad. They have a rifle, hand grenade, and later on a grenade launcher as well as a healing item called 'Ragnaid'. Scouts are best used for flanking enemies and acting as spotters. As far as combat goes they are nothing extraordinary. Grenades can be used to deal heavy damage to other infantry and light damage to tank treads as well as blow up sandbags. The rifles they carry do considerable damage but are best used to get headshots. Scouts also have low heath but are also the fastest unit and have the most energy. Shocktroopers fill the role as frontline assault units. Their armaments include a machinegun, hand grenade, Ragnaid, and later on a flamethrower. Best used for close and mid-range combat, Shocktroopers are one of the most basic but most useful units in the game. Dealing heavy bodyshot and headshot damage as well as being able to easily destroy tanks, they are one of the most well-rounded unit in the game. They have decent energy and fast speed. Lancers act as anti-armor units with high explosive damage and high health, they fill the need of demolitions. Their arms include an anti-tank lance with 3 shots, Ragnaid, or an optional anti-infantry lance. They are one of the only units that are able to penetrate tank armor. Engineers act as your support units. They are used to disarm mines, heal teammates, repair sandbags and tanks, and deliver ammo to units that use it ( Note; the only times a unit uses ammo is when they use a weapon that has limited ammo, rifles and machineguns do not use ammo but sniper rifles, grenades/launchers, lances do). Engineers are best kept behind the tanks or behind cover. They have a rifle that is the same as the scout's but unlike the scouts they move slower and have less energy. Their arms include a rifle, one large Ragnaid, the engineer's tool, and grenades. Finally we have Snipers, snipers do what else than shoot heads from a distance. They have high-powered bolt-action rifles that have a scope that typically one hits an enemy unless they are behind sandbags. Sniper are the slowest and have the least amount of energy of them all. Their arms include a sniper rifle and a Ragnaid. These units are best kept behind lines and cover for they have very little health.  In the game there is a leveling mechanic. Units don't level individually, instead you gain experience points from completing missions and skirmishes. Using the experience you can access the training field and level up the unit's class altogether. Doing so will raise the unit's health and grant them new abilities and even commands. Commands are used in the battlefield as actions you can ask a 'third party' or your squad to carry out. These commands include but are not limited to: sniper support, mortar support, healing requests, retreat requests, and stat bonuses that last for a turn. all of these require 'command points' which is our next subject.  Command points are required to move units and carry out commands. Some commands take more 'CP' than others and certain units require more CP to use than others, and that unit is...  Tanks!  The tank is where you (the commander) resides during battle. Your tank can be upgraded as well as weapons to enhance their effects like extra damage or extra health. The tank costs two CP to use and has slow speed and decent energy. The tank is armed with one anti-tank cannon, one mortar, and a machinegun. The tank can also only be damaged by other tanks or lancers, bullets deal no damage unless the back of the tank known as the 'radiator' is hit. The radiator is the weakest point of the tank. One lance or one tank shell to the radiator and its all over, mission failed. It is advised that you never turn your back to an enemy of any kind. Along the way you will receive a new tank, it moves faster and has less total health but can be outfitted with a flamethower or gattlinggun to replace the cannon.  The enemy also has access to tanks and has 4 different types. The light tank: easiest to destroy, only a real threat to infantry. The medium tank: Has good anti-armor ability and is good at eliminating infantry, has a rear-mounted machinegun to protect the radiator. The heavy tank: extreme anti-armor ability and can destroy infantry with ease. has an extra turret mounted on it that acts as a heavy machinegun that can be destroyed. The tank destoyer: effectively a moving artillery piece, has a very high damaging cannon that cannot rotate, a machinegun, and weak armor comparable to a medium tank.  Each battle has its own twist to it. Some battles you are on an offensive and the enemy will have bunkers and artillery shot down on you. Other times you are trying to hold a position or destroy a key enemy while waves of troops attack. There are also skirmish battles that have no twist and are normally balanced.  In the later half of the game you can upgrade your weapons to deal more damage, have better accuracy, have an added effect like poison, or have more range. All possible with the money you receive from completing missions. You can also buy enhanced uniforms that provide better damage resistance or buy special enhancements for your tank that takes up space on it. There can only be a set ammount of these upgrades but they are worth the times and resources.  That effectively concludes gameplay and the story is wonderful but I will not spoil it in the slightest. The story is up to you to learn and the backstories on the characters are so as well. I wish you a successful war effort Lieutenant!"
"  I recieved this as a gift. As a fan of strategy games and hungering for some turn based strategy as of late I added this to my wishlist. I just beat it today after almost doing nothing but playing this game for a week or so. overally it's a 9/10, personally it's a perfect 10/10 to me. The only problem I have is some of the characters don't quite develop naturally in a way with the story but that's to be expected of anything anime related. If you like strategy - buy this game, if you like wartime anime - buy this game. The story is like an alternate earth / alternate history fantasy setting and is very moving emotionally at points. Reading about the quirkyness of the squad members not shown in cutscenes is great to and adds a believable, real element to the world of Europa. With lots of unlocks a natural progression of weapons development in-game and a 'clear save' after you beat it this is well-worth the money. (even though I was lucky enough to get it as a gift &gt;w&lt;)   I hope you enjoy this game and give it a favorable review."
it's good...
" By removing certain limitations normally present in this genre, Valkyria Chronicles offers much more active, strategic and engaging combat on top of being basically an anime series that you play through.  VALKYRIA CHRONICLES"
"This game is a very well made one. It's a really shame that it did not receive the success it deserves. The story is well written, the gameplay is very good, the cartoon-like graphics makes you feel to be inside a manga. Buy it. Now!"
"Super fun and addicting, great graphics but easy to run. In depth gameplay that rewards strategy. Highly reccomend."
This is avery entertaining game that I plan on playing far into the future. There are many stragegies that one can employ in the campaign and me and my friends have tried to out do one another in more and more creative ways. 10/10 would play again.
"although i haven't finished it (yet;almost there), i can really say that i've had one of the greatest experiences in gaming of my whole life, Every element of this game was really compelling for me, even if i felt like quiting at some points of it, but i always returned. Although, it's far from perfect, because, at leats in my computer; it had some graphic issues like one of marina's arm looked like an sphaggetti, largo lacked an abdomen for most of the time, welkin lacked a wrist, and so on. Also, the A.I. is not the most smartest one, but, what game really haves one? also, the pacing of the dialogs, and that you couldn't skip those you had already seen, it was awful. but, even with these problems (and surely even more), it delivers an experience that, some S-RPGS'S/T-RPG'S or other war-based games fail to deliver.  If you really are into WW 2 based stuff, or medieval fantasy mixed with WW 2, then this, an its sequels might be what you are looking for."
THROUGH THE GATES OF HELL AS WE MAKE OUR WAY TO HEAVEN THROUGH THE IMPERIAL LINES PRIMO VICTORIA
"the essence of a turn-based game is that you have nearly endless TIME to make decisions. otherwise it would be called time-based or real-time. but in VC you have to go in fire-mode as soon as possible when you get in fire-range of enemies or you will be killed by 'automatic fire'.  so why that bad gameplay-decision? cause VC have the poorest/dumbest ki/ai i ever seen in a game.  so... not really a bad shooter, but definite not a turn-based game. 5/10"
"I liked this game's combination of turn-based and real time tactics with many cut-scenes and extensive story. The story was a bit cliche with stereotypical characters and expected moralistic messages, but I don't expect much from a strategy game, and the story that was there was presented well-enough to keep me playing.  The game's engine that lets you plan your moves on a map before executing them one-at-a-time in real time worked well for me, with just enough real-time action to keep the excitement, but also enough time for strategic planning.  Overall I would recommend this game for its combination of engaging gameplay and story, despite the story's faults."
i love the story between Alicia and Welkins! Is best loli darcsen ever XD
war is he'll
Love the game so far. It has good story and the gameplay is also great ^_^
"While I love the theme and art style, its game mechanics leave a bit to be desired. If you could somehow combine the design of this with the game mechanics of XCOM, you would have a masterpiece."
One of my favorite games.
"Its Fire Emblem, crossed with a 3rd person shooter. So....pretty much the best game ever made."
"A game that isn't as well known as other Strategy/RPG games and i only really stumbled across it by chance - but glad that i did.  With it's unique look and interesting characters and story (with some anime style cheese thown in here and there) Valkyria Chronicles has a charm to it that drew me in. In terms of gameplay, it's somewhat similar to Hogs Of War for those of you who remember that game on the PS1. It's also one of the few games in some time that's made me want to carry on playing through to completion, which is becoming an increasing rarity. With New Game Plus there's also reason to carry on a bit longer even after completing the pretty lengthy campaign.  This game may not be for those of you who can't look past the anime esque style, but i'd definately recommend if you have any interest in Strategy and RPG games."
"Short version: 'Meh' It's not bad, especially for $20, I just can't personally recommend it.    The story starts off relatively serious, but very quickly becomes a saturday morning cartoon. Some of the \'Side Stories\' also contain plot critical information, and can be unlocked out of order.   Basically don\'t play this game for the story, especially if you\'re not a fan of Captain Planet.   As for the gameplay, it innovates on the turned based tactical RPG genre a bit by having you personally take control of the characters you want to move, and manually aim when you wish to shoot. It starts off being very fun and interesting but enemies quickly become bullet spongy, immune to headshots, or resistant to exlposions, made worse by the fact your shots can randomly miss despite having to manually aim. I found myself save scumming nearly every mission after the first boss because of how stale the combat became, and because certain missions can quickly become unbeatable if you aren\'t familiar with the level, and objectives.   The game features a progression system, in which experience can be contributed towards one of the 5 infantry classes (You cannot choose a class). Each level will increase health, and at certain thresholds you\'ll unlock a \'Potential\' (Special trait). At lvl 11, you\'ll unlock an elite version of the class, which unlocks a new weapon and usually has a noticable increase to the classes total Action Pool. However this progression is pretty lackluster, even at maximum level the enemy will often still be stronger than you. Some of the alternate weapons are also pretty terrible compared to the default weapon, and should rarely be taken into combat.  I mentioned \'Potentials\' which is unfortunately another missed opportunity, as well as a reason to save scum. Some of the potentials a character have can be incredibly powerful, but most of them are activated randomly. Double Tank Damage for instance, this can lead to your Anti-Armor infantry 1 shotting most tanks if this triggers, but it is entirely random when it does. This can be infuriating if there\'s an enemy tank that you NEED to kill this turn for whatever reason.  However, as much as I personally HATE this game, I cannot say that it is bad, or that it isn\'t worth $20.00. It\'s just not something everyone will like, and most people will probably find SOMETHING to hate about this game if they play it all the way through. If the idea of a 3rd person tactical RPG set in fantasy WWII Switzerland interests you, then it might be worth checking out, especially if it goes on sale."
"I've just got discount to buy this game, and it is fun to play. imagine a TBS strategy game combine with TPS. and this is Valkyria"
"10/10 i am speechless. storyline are perfect, brings the emotion, just like reading books.  i.. i dont know how to describe it with words.  'i have completed this game once in pirated version, and i made a promise that i wont re-play it until i buy the original version.'  that's how great Valkyria Chronicles is."
"Loved the Anime, saw this game on sale, had to get it. Fun classic turn-based fighting with great visual story to back it up. The fighting seemed like it would get repetitive, but each encoutour got more complex with multiple ways to win/lose and challenging!"
"It's like playing an anime. 10/10 Also, Largo best girl."
realy great game love the story :3
"This delightful strategy JRPG comes highly recommended, if on sale.  Pros:    Engaging story line that is only occaisonally guilty of *LOOK AT THE BIG THING HAPPENING HERE*    Interesting combat system that actually requires you to use your brain!    Simple unfussy controls.   Cons:     If you aren't fond of cutscenes stay clear! There are a heck of a lot of them and, although well done, they can be a little wearing.    Some of the missions feel a little unfair, due to the special conditions of the mission.    That bloody pig, although it is barely in the game.   And yes, when *Spolier* gets hit by the *Spoiler* and *Spoiler* I cried. Be warned!  Enjoyable 48 hrs, will play again in a couple of years time."
"Captivating story, very beautiful art design, complex character progression and very tactical gameplay make Valkyria Chronicles a really great and memorable game. It's a shame they never released the two follow up games in the west."
A very painful turn-based strategy game
"Finally had the chance to play this game. Perfect mix of RPG and Strategy elements, and anime style is a huge plus for me. Not perfect (omg moving a tank) but love it overall"
Great Story based game and interesting gameplay which involve strategic and tactical approach..
"If you want an inovative way to play a turn-based strategy game this game is for you. Unlike most you walk your character in 3rd person view and shoot just the same but with minimal interaction, you just walk, aim and then click shoot for the tropper to shoot, but beware for if you walk too close to the enemy they will start fire upon you, same comes when you have fired upon them counter-attacks happens almost all the time. The game is filled woith suprise attacks which makes everything harder for your small squad, for when you see victory the game gives you more ♥♥♥♥ to do and i have had to restart many times as i have seen the reinforcement take out my back up soldiers when they spawn right behind them. But other than that the story is quiet rich, it takes a lot of time to complete it all and gives you atleast 100hours of gameplay with the reward of replayability."
"One of the most fun tactical games I've ever played.  Most of the fun comes from trying to make the game mechanics work for you.  Certain classes have certain abilities and weapons and excel at certain roles, like you might expect. However, your team works on a shared system of movement and action points. You can use this to move many of your units, or just one.  Trying to manuver just one unit (usually a scout) across the map to do all the things you want is one of the most fun things I've ever done in gaming. I'm not sure why, but it is.  Don't be turned away from the Anime aspect of the game, if that's not something you tend to enjoy. I'm not an anime guy really, but the story and characters in this game are top notch."
"I've really enjoyed the majority of this game thus far. Great gameplay and characters. The art style is beautiful and despite my usual preference i've quite enjoyed the cheesiness and obvious Japanase tropes. However, I am NOT pleased by the implementation of the pig with wings. Like wtf? I was enjoying the gritty realism of being a squad leader and then this wacky backy pig comes along and takes all the seriousness and immersion away - as well as my credit! I slogged to capture a base for like 40 mins, only for the end dialogue to congratulate the flying pulled pork for its 'contribution'. I lost good soldiers on that mission, yet after a gruelling fight fuelled with blood sweat and tears, 'the animals of the forest' are heralded as the supposed cause for victory. Very upsetting and unmotivating.  Prior to purchase I heard that there were some 'sad' parts during the story. I genuinely hope this pig gets turned into bacon. Because: 1) He won't be able to steal my spotllight. 2) Alicia will be upset and I'll comfort her - which in turn should lead to... and 3) BBQ."
"Love this game :).   -when your units dies in a skirmish make sure to reload the last save, so you can undo their deaths hahahahaha -Left No Man/Woman behind  10/10 would save game and units life XD"
"For a game that allows you to have a squad full of teenage girls and make them march into battle to kick a bunch of ♥♥♥, there is a refreshingly low amount of fan service. Shocker, right?  The gameplay holds up well for a title that was originally on PS3. There is a strong strategic element present in levels, and the game gets hard pretty fast if you're not careful. Although the game seems a bit biased on making you find a way to Scout-rush a level to get the highest possible grade, you can always leave that to NG+. There's a bit of level grinding needed if you want to hit max level with all your classes before endgame, but as you progress through the game, you will unlock several repeatable skirmish levels to keep level grinding from getting too monotonous. Once you feel confident, you can try the included DLC skirmishes/challenges, which not only net you with far greater XP when you beat them, but will give you some powerful gear to equip your fave soldiers with in the base game (pro tip: the scout challenge rewards you with a laughably OP rifle).  The PC port saw some improved graphics too, and I must say it is one of the most stable PC ports I've played. Controls are also correctly rendered with corresponding buttons if you play with a controller. It's the little things like that that show how much care went into the port.  The game's storyline is pretty good, and gets surprisingly serious and realistic with its themes as it goes on. There is naturally some fanservice and typical tropes at play here, but overall, the game manages to be serious when the story demands it, and kicks back with humour just when it is needed the most.  Twenty bucks is a fair price for this, you can also get this port on PS4 if you want, too. I paid 5 bucks during a sale over a year ago and I felt like I paid too little, but hey, that's just me, and it means some people got gifted this game this summer sale whether they wanted it or not!  So now that leaves me with this: Are you ready to save Anime Switzerland from the evil nation of Medieval Tank Fetishists?"
This game is great. Bleh.
"If you can't decide whether to play or watch, I would recommend playing athe game to learn the characters then watch the anime. They don't tell you much about the characters in the anime so the game helps it. I palyed the game half-way then watched the anime.  Gameplay wise, it's enjoyable and planing about what you're going to do."
"Small cinematically-themed chapters, great exposition, and a tactically-sound-yet easily-utilized combat system combine to make this a true classic on NOW the PC!!"
"overall great game. best cell shading I've seen, challenging combat, engaging story with good character development. The controls can be frustrating if you are using a key board and there is a couple of glitches that will ruin a match but other then that it is a solid game."
"One of my favorite games of all time. I put quite a few hours into it when it was released on PS3. Then my console ♥♥♥♥ed out on me. I switched back to PC gaming after that, so until now, I never had a chance to finsih what I started.   What I like: The combat system and the graphic style. Also, as you progress, the game depth is quite satisfying. What's meh: A little clunky on the controls and the difficulty ramp. Whay I dislike: The story, but in complete fairness, I'm not a sucker for JRPG tales. I'm more of a game mechanics-phile. As long that the characters are likeable, then I'm willing to forgive corny dialouge or weak story lines. Some may find it entertaining. I'm just a little biased.  Bottom line: If you like Tac-Turn, give it a shot...regardless of what you think of the story."
"This game tells the story of a small neutral nation called Gallia caught in a war between two factions (the war is basically WWII, but set in a fictional continent). This nation is rich in ragnite, a fictional element that is apparently very valuable, so the evil Empire invades Gallia to seize its ragnite reserves, so it's your duty as lieutenant to defend against those ♥♥♥♥ers.  Anyways, this games is basically a tactical JRPG, it feels and plays a lot like Fire Emblem, but set in a mid 20th century european country, and you have guns and tanks instead of swords and magic and bows and that stuff. It has been really fun so far, but keep in mind that the slightest mistake or the wrong positioning can make you lose the battle (I just lost one because my tank got one-shotted by another one in the back, 'cause I slightly moved my tank to the right, I didn't think of it as important).  So if you like tactical games and JRPG go ahead and buy this, you won't regret it."
"What a refreshingly original game this is. It has a good story line, and the action sequences are sound. The animated style of the game is a great reprieve from the 3d games mostly out. You have to plan your moves and use good tactics. It plays like a comic book. Very original and enjoyable."
"  You can experience your grandfather's(or great grandfather's) past during the war. By enlisting 12 year olds to fight against the enemy who look like Nazis, who are from the east part of the globe and run by a monarch.  10/10 would relive my pawpaw's memories.  "
In a single word?  Classic!
"Just finished this gem. This is like XCOM with a well written story and more old-school RPG elements.   The ONLY bad things in this game: ♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-tank units and driving the tanks around. Boy do they handle crappy.  But the game itself is a solid 10/10, turn based but also boots on the ground shooting combat style rpg.  Great Story, Great Core Gameplay, Great Characters and development. Just great all around.   Also props to the animators for making such human-like humans. Jesus Christ. The only time they don't look almost real is when they get 'knocked out' and fold up liek a paper bag."
"I generally dislike JRPGs, but this game was on sale so I bought it. Though some things gameplay wise aren't explained as well as they should be, this game is really really fun and not to hard to get into. It's a great game that I would recommend to everyone and anyone."
  TL;DR
"This is a very entertaining game, with a pretty good and addicting storyline. The gameplay is fun and challenging, while most of the time it is not 'too hard' and the difficulty and learning curve is pretty well put together. I personally is not too fond of anime, except for a few games and this is one of them. The reason is that everything is pretty realistic and natural, while the environment, weapons and setting is really nice.  I had some gay guy in my squad, Hans or Lass I think? He is absolutely awesome and has the best lines ever. Every match is different and new elements is often added to constantly keep the experience fresh and challenging.  It has a pretty nice Level system, where you train and upgrade each of your classes. So if you upgrade Scouts, all scouts are upgraded. It has a very nice, but a bit linear Weapon system too. I like it. You just spend your money to upgrade weapons and your tank. Later there will be different choices for example Attack+ or Accuracy+, you choose. If you are low on money, there are always training and special ops, where you can earn some cash, before moving on with the story.  There are many small clips of cutscenes throughout the game, which is nice. It has a sort of Final Fantasy anime style to it, and NOT the cheap and bad porn anime. Therefore the cutscenes are nice and kept me watching.  I would recommend this game to anyone who want to play a really good game that is worth both the time and money. I believe many people would like this, even those who dislike manga and all that.  A very good game!"
"  If you like a good solid RPG with a fairly rich story and developed characters then you should try this game out. It reminds me of Fire Emblem in its gameplay, but think Battalion Wars if it were an RPG. It is a challenging game that rewards those who utilize strategy instead of shooting every enemy and waging nonsensical war. I haven't delved too far into the game itself but so far I am thoroughly enjoying the experience. The music is beautiful and the dialogue between characters is never dull. My one wish is that there was some sort of multiplayer skirmish mode within the game. If there is a mod out there for multiplayer I would be very eager to explore that!"
"I've been loving this game! It's almost like a cross between Final Fantasy Tactics (strategy-wise) and Fallout 3+ (combat-wise), but different in some ways as well. In my experience, ever the minor characters are relatable and there's a real sense of connection with them due to some great voice acting and individualized traits. I'd been wanting to play this for 8 years, and I'm finally getting to play it! Thanks, Steam Sale!"
"Absolutely one of my favorite SRPG (AKA Tactical Role-Playing Game / Strategy Role-Playing Game) series of all time. My PlayStation 3 broke, and I don't have a PlayStation Portable, so I was extremely happy when SEGA released Valkyria Chronicles for Steam. That said, it's not a perfect port. There are a few bugs here and there, but that's to be expected. It's not nearly as bad as, say, The story is absolutely beautiful, and the art style and soundtrack match the feeling the game conveys. That said, the game is quite unforgiving, and it'll often require more than one restart per level, but as they say, 'where there's a will, there's a way.' No level is impossible once you learn the mechanics.  Each level is extremely dynamic, with ever-changing objectives and enemies. One moment, you may be tasked to assault an impenetrable fortress. The next, you may be rescuing civilians whom you pass by on the way to said fortress. All in all, well worth the money. That said, (as usual) it's probably better try try to nab this one on sale. Especially for the more casual players.  EDIT: Well, I have a PSP now... and then SEGA goes out and annouces Blue Revolution. Guess I'm getting a PS4, too. Also, I think it's funny that the Tier 5 badge is a class that isn't even featured in the first game.  UPDATE: I find it amusing that this game's Tier 5 Badge is 'Gunner', which is a class that isn't available in this game but shows up in later installments."
"The game has a strong WWII feel to it, so if you like that part of history I think you will love this game. It is very rich in character development, very few one dimensional characters. Definitely worth the play. After playing it myself I bought it for a friend and recommend it to everyone! It ranks highly in my list of games I have ever play (#2 to be exact).  PS. By the book chapters, they provide additional story."
"good game , story rich,  also a bit boring to grind exp and gold   but overall the conclusion quite good  recommended"
"The game has A Pig with wings....F***ING WINGS!  Well lets get to the real review shall we now.   Well Technically I don't have anything against the game, after all it gave me what I expected from it:  -Great story progression -Great characters -Very beautiful graphics, it has this Painting style kind of graphics to it -It has that WW2 feel to it, I don't know about you guys but I personally like WW2 games -Nice voice acting -Challenging Levels -Etc....  The only thing I hate about the games is that: -The controls are somewhat clunky sometimes -The wall clipping is not consistent, sometimes you can shoot through the edge of a wall and sometimes it won't let you -The fact that your tanks always get stuck for some sort of reason  Overall the game was great. I would defintitely suggest you give this game a try."
BEST GAME EVURRRRRR I HOPE THEY WILL PUT THE OTHER TWO &lt;3
"First off, If you're not a fan of anime, this is probably not the game for you. However, if you do enjoy it or just don't mind it, then there’s a lot to love here. Think if X-Com and Code Geass had a very drunken one night stand, and you'll get an idea of what this game is.  Pros:  -Very engrossing story, especially if you enjoy WW2 history -Great main characters, with a surprising amount of depth -Minor Characters with layered back stories, which make you feel bad for letting them die -Beautiful art style -Interesting tactical system, with all unit types having uses throughout the story -Character perk system leads to having to tailor your squad to the mission. Or just roll with an all Waifu army. Whichever floats your boat -Deals with some heavy **** really well -Hitting that last ditch shot across the map feels so very good  Cons:  -The A.I. Is not the best, and can make stupid decisions at times. Nice if it helps you win a level, but could be disappointing for strategy buffs -Some missions contain high amounts of BS (Units that appear from nowhere, invincible enemies, etc.)  However, you can cheese the game right back, so there's that) -You have to play inventory Tetris for tank upgrades (Not too bad, but I really hate it when games do it) -Rankings based on turns to complete mission rather than a better metric for skill -Tank controls can be terrible. Sometimes you'll spin around for no reason, or get stuck on nothing. Not game breaking, but can be annoying nonetheless. -Voice acting can't be muted via the menus, even though Music and FX can. (Another pet peeve. I like to listen to my music while skirmishing) -Save system is a little clunky  In summary, it's a really great story and characters, with combat that’s a bit clunky, with occasional sections of BS, which in the end is a really enjoyable game.  Solid 8.5/10 would defend Gallia again"
The most surprising game that I have ever played &amp; it's one of the best SEGA titles that I've ever played. How did I miss out on a great game when it was released on PS3?
"A story-rich (though with not so good translation) turn-based strategy where you control your units in real-time. There are upgrades and equipments but no actual grinding is needed.  My rating: 86/100 - Liked it a lot   Reasons of playing:  - Gameplay seems interesting, beatiful graphics, looked through its interface beforehand. Also, eye-friendly anime-styled characters.   My experience:  - Completed the game three times (had to, twice for all achievements, third time just for). Got an A in all, including EX/DLC episodes. I think this game was well-planned out as there are surprises and tricks in just about every stages. On my first run, I went without orders and repeated stages (of course, I even got a C on some stages) but managed to clear the game without casualties   (15424)   (Too bad though, I did not get the decoration I should have gotten). Completed everything in my second run before getting my hands on DLCs. Some buffs are really overpowered but you they are not really necessary. - To be honest, most of the game is only hard at first or maybe second tries. Once I learned all the trick, I could just go back and Ace all the maps, even those EX ones. But the fun of this game lies in when it is still hard. That's why I will just say 'Don't abuse Save/Load system'.   What I like:  - First, I have to say that this game is vastly customizable, and by that I mean the team building, equipments, play styles, and strategy. In many, or at least, some stages, you can do different things and still get the same beautiful end result. (Does not apply to few certain stages, for example, certain DLC stages.) - The gameplay is interesting and strategic (depends on how you play, though). Positioning and facing matters, as well as characters/classes/equipments selction. You will need to balance the use of every classes in your team. I think it is funny how as the stages get harder, tanks and snipers have more limitations while engineers get more role. - This game is eye-friendly with anime-styled characters, nice scenery, no blood, no 'blend-in' kind of pseudo-camouflage. - There are surprises to spice things up and make the game not too boring. - The enemy is not weak, and the AI is not stupid (though it sometimes make stupid moves like running themselves toward death as a set of programmed actions for spammed units).   What I don't like:  - Translation could be improved. - A 'Stairs to the Dark Underworld' bug in one of the Citadel Ghirlando Map. - Once you get past the stage for the first time, you will most likely pretty much know all the tricks, and clearing the same stages over again can get too repititive, especially if you know the AI's behavior and set of actions. - I want to 'equip all units in this class' for dropped weapons all well, but that is fine... - I do not know if this is just me or I just cannot get my units to fire before an enemy intercepts when they are standing face to face. - This game can be really slow and lag a lot on slower PCs. I have expirienced that before changing my older PC to current one. The commands become slow to reach. Commands like moving, stopping, or taking actions may not reach in time. - While this game is eye-friendly, it may not be mind-friendly for some people. - Welkin's group are kind of... overly optimistic... I guess...   Something else to say:  - (Leeted for being a Spoiler)   15424  ... I wish that had never happened..."
hate the dlc (edy detachment) even though it's a side story. one particular sentences in the end of mission spoil a huge chunk of main character futures(if you do it before finishing the main campaign). 
"An excellent CASUAL game. I fell in love with it, but still was ever so slightly disappointed by the actual gameplay.  Pros: - The plot's good (slightly more anime-ish than I would've liked, but... you know, that is to be expected) - The voice acting is a lot better than I would've expected. Not perfect, but very pleasant. - The graphics are very pretty.  - The gameplay is fun. Really. Every unit has their own personality, you will probably know most of them by name when this is all over, maybe even keep track of their heroic accomplishments, as well as epic fails.  Ok, so let's cut to the case already. Cons: - You can use any unit an unlimited number of times, which is, IMO, a terrible game mechanic for a turn-based game. Though you can usually deploy up to 9 units in a single op, you'd probably be using 5 of them, at best. There is very little reason to have 2+ units of the same class. - The AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Like, most of the time it thinks that it's a good idea to make most of their troops run right in front of a tank\shocktrooper squad (spoilers: it's not!). - The 'Run in front of a single enemy and shoot them in the face before they shoot you' is a viable strategy. Scarily effective! - The tank controls are horrible, and you will need tanks to... make any sort of progress, really. Now, if you've completed Dark Souls with keyboard and mouse, you won't have much trouble, really, but for mere mortals getting the hang of it might be callenging.  Basically, if you want to just have fun, watch a very decent anime and have a fight with a rather silly opponent, this game's for you. But if you want to have an 'extremely serious', fair battle of wits with a smart opponent... well, go play chess or someting."
Definitely a great game with a great story an very interesting anime style characters.
8/10
Scout op nerf pls
"After completing my first playthrough of this game, I must say it is one of my favorite games I highly recommend it.   Pros:  - The art style is fantastic, this is an example of a game that doesn't need realistic graphics to be amazing. - It is a challenge, while some missions are easy, some of them require a ton of planning and working with multiple strategies on the off chance something goes wrong, which will likely happen. - Engaging story, the story, for the most part, is very immersive, you'll grow to like some characters, and hate others. - A ton of play styles, other than the limited class amount, you can play with almost any style that you wish. Do you want to have only machine gun carrying troops, you can. Do you want to play with only a tank and a sniper, you can. You aren't forced to play a certain style, while some styles may be more effective than others, any strategy is possible. - Option between having the characters speak Japanese or English. While some may not bother switching the spoken language, it is an option. - No level grinding required, there hasn't been a point in the game where I required playing the optional missions to beat a level, and I didn't ace every mission before hand, in fact, over half of my missions were C rank, which is normally the average rank for taking out every enemy before getting the end objective.   Cons - The game doesn't explain stuff well at certain points. During my full playthough, I have gotten two game overs due to the fact that unless you are the very observant, you can completely miss some required parts that either makes your mission very difficult, or just lead to an instant game over. - Random Number Generator, while you can heavily influence many things randomly generated, it still exists, there are many times where I have had to hold back a turn instead of advancing because the troops are horrible at aiming. - The game rewards rushed strategies more than safer. The game's ranking system is very weird, due to the fact that you can rush the end of the level with a scout and get an A rank while taking out every enemy and eliminating many threats will reward a lower rank.  While this isn't technically a con, there is an achievement that is difficult to get, not that it is actually difficult to get, but because late game, where you are attached to your squad (and the possibility of the achievement opens), the choice of which unit to sacrifice for it is one that I myself personally refuse to get, I will achieve everything else in my multiple playthroughs though. Unless of course, one person in your squad ends up costing you a mission and you want them to suffer, but who would ever do that.  As a result, this is a game that you will put many hours into, unless you aren't a fan of the game, but there will always be those games to some people. I've honestly had less fun playing games that cost $50 while this is $20, and I will be going back to this for multiple playthroughs.   I'll give my experience with squad 7 a 8.5/10"
"At first I wasnt really sure about this game, it stinks of consoles and I am not big fan of Japanese games. But after a few hours I was totally hooked. The story gets really interesting and provides some epic war scenes on battlefield. Gameplay is combination of strategy, 3rd person action and tactic rpg, which is really weird combination but works great. The game is nothing for rush action players, because it is hard to succeed and you have to cooparate with all your characters to survive and win the fight. Thank you for this port."
I liked this game at first but the farther I got in it the more confused I became about its goal as a strategy-esc game. It seams that almost every level you get more points for just running ahead like a crazy person to the goal then to actually using any real tactic or strategy to beat your enemy down. A few boards also seemed to have no use for the tanks which I thought was strange.   I still played it for 20 hours though so it was totally worth whatever I payed for it.
game is great i lov the gameplay style its pretty amazing
Recommended game
"Amazing game! the story is great, the music is terrific and i love how it takes a turned based strategy game and lets you immerse yourself in it by acually moving your units as you wish in your turn and reacting to the responce of the enemy (exp, using cover to avoid being shot by enemy units when advancing)! However! if you plan to play i have some important pointers! 1. always try to have Largo Rosie and Allicia deployed on the feild even if you don't plan to use them as they give command points which are VERY important 2. always try to have atleast 1 other unit nearby another because if somone goes down and dies before a freindly can save them they are gone PERMAMENTLY since this game has perma death for ALL units 3. some of your units may feel invinsible with how easally they can take out enemys and hold positions (exp. tanks are very strong and very sturdy) but it is infact very easy to be wiped out by enemys you didn't where there or even events during missions that change a great spot into a death trap! (and keep an eye on where your tank's reactor is faceing, enemies like to snipe it if they can so much as peek at it) 4. when you go to see the writing on the wall and Ellet (the reporter) asks you to buy some reports from her DO IT! they unlock special potentials for certain individuals that will likely want to be using throught the game and can be quite powerful/convinient"
I give Valkyria Chronicles a   BUY NOW - if your a fan of turnbased games SALE- if your not sure of the genre or you wanna play an engaging game in between AAA releases   Didn't expect much from this game but I had extra steam points so i thought i would buy it. This is my first JRPG so i cant be a good judge in terms of the JRPG genre but if you are new to the genre this review is for you  PROS  -Interesting turnbased combat system that doesnt destroy the pacing -The setting is a alternative world war 1 era - Challenging campain scenarios - nice cast of side characters and main characters -Engaging narrative - rouge like mechanics - relevant character classes that can suit your style  Cons - there is a learning curve if your new at this genre - english voice acting is a bit cringey (recomend the japanese) - story near the end got a bit wonky in my opinion but nothing too bad.  Final thoughts Valkyria chronicles os a very enjoyable strategy game that mixes the turn based combat and live action gameplay very well. Think of this as a third person turnbased game. Honestly i was never a fan of the 'god view' turn based stratefy games that JRPG's are known for but when i saw the gameplay footage of this it caught my attention. One last thing about the narrative of the game. While the main story is a bit lacking I find the mix of rouge like elemnts like permanent character death very refreshing to a story driven game. All the minor characters can die if you pass the mission ( if all of your team dies i think it will revert like nothing happened.) This is similar to the xcom style where the units you build can die permanently. This one time I had a unit who was in critical condition and i had a choice to continue attacking the objective or save her. Thinking I was about to win anyway I went for the objective but i didnt destroy it. So when it was the enemy's turn they killed of one of my units and there was a very sad moment where I realized the consequence of my move. It doesnt help that all of the side characters have there own personalities and unique character models so i was genuinely attached to my team.    
"Game is pretty great. It's hard as ♥♥♥♥ at times, but it's also quite rewarding. It's challenging in the way that games should be, you will go along stressed to finish a mission without anyone dying and it feels fantastic when you do it (especially later on). Also the story is interesting and keeps me drawn in.  10/10"
If you like waifus with guns then this is a good game.
  this game is Super awesome! just like the anime story line! 11/10.
The story was amazing and each battle completed was rewarding.
I read the weaponry tabs and the Imperial anti-tank lances were manufactured by someone called 'Adolf von Bismarck'.  It's like this game isn't even trying to disguise the whole 'Imperials are Nazis' thing. All it's missing now is someone called Otto Hitler.
"Sega's Fire Emblem with guns, It really explains itself."
"Great game. For a Sega game, this deserves a lot of attention (there's more to sonic you know). Thumbs up!    P.S. And this is coming from a sonic fan."
"This game is a hidden gem no doubt! Combining rpg elements with third person shooting (sorta), Valkyria Chronicles is a must have for it's story, variety of tactics, and challenge to outwit enemy armies. Everyone needs to give this game a shot, cause you won't regret it!"
"I think I'm about halfway into chapter one.  So far, I think I'm going to enjoy this game. Nice turn-based tactical combat system that has a 1st person over-the-shoulder component after you select your combat unit.  But, sweet fancy Moses, are there already a  lot  of cut-scenes. It's like like a freakin' anime with battles sprinkled in. I'm hoping the pace improves, but right now, my appraisal is a nice tactical game with the bloat, emotional maturity, and awkward relationship dynamics of a revisionist history Euro-centered anime."
Very fun! But make sure to save before you exit game because i made that mistake.... But otherwise if you like board games then this game is very similar to them... So yeh...
"A very unique battle system that combines strategy with limited 3rd person action. Mix that with an abundance of characters and a decent storyline and you have VC. My squad is only composed of women, hail the matriarchy.   This was actually the very first game that I had on steam (apart from Civ5 which was given out for free during the golden joysticks awards). Ty /b/ro for gifting it to me, I had great fun with it."
"Great game. Although the story is kinda cliche at times, it has many emotive moments, and the plot twists keep it interesting. The characters are quite likeable, you may encounter a few anime stereotypes here and there, but most of them are pretty good.   Gameplay-wise is where Valkyria Chronicles shines. The game is some kind of mix between action rpg, strategy rpg and shooter, and plays perfectly. You control a squad of gallian soldiers, each one associated to a class. There aren't many classes, but they all play differently, and they are really cool (there's a class with explosive lances, just saying). You have a bar which determines how far you can get during the turns of each of your soldiers. Moving an unit costs a command point, and when you run out of them your turn ends. The AI is decent, it reacts to your actions quite well. The missions may have similar objectives, but they aren't repetitive at all.   The aesthetic of the game is incredible, it looks as if the game was made with watercolors. The graphics hold up quite well too, and the animations are detailed, even if some of them are reutilized. The soundtrack is mainly orchestral, and the themes fit with the atmosphere of the game.  The game has a decent length too, it took me 40 hours to finish it, so you don't have to worry about the amount of content.  I definitely recommend Valkyria Chronicles. It's a flawless game, and you'll probably enjoy it, even if you aren't into anime. So don't be afraid of giving it a try, it's worth it."
"Fantastic game. Storyline was awesome and I really liked the characters of this game. I am officially hooked on to this series. The gameplay was fairly enjoyable and fairly simple to understand and get good at. Though at the end game things get a bit to cheap and easy when you max out your scout who can just completely blitz through the entire enemy battalion and capture the the enemy base on your first turn.   I highly reccommend this game. If you are a fan of strategy and RPG, this is the game for you.   Also it has options for both English and Japanese, so if you don't like the English dub then you can switch to original Japanese which is much better."
"There are not many games that I pick up and almost immediately say, 'I want to collect everything that this game has to offer.' But this is one of them. I have played all 3 of the Valkyria Chronicles games on the PSP and they blew my mind with a unique combat system, amazing story, immersive characters, and a variety of weapons. The remaster of this game is visually BEAUTIFUL and is almost like playing a whole new game. I can only hope that they bring back the final 2 games of the series as they seemed to build even more on the combat system and the job classes (offering more diversity in classes). I can almost beg that they do this. Great game and an amazing remaster. Highly recommended."
I find the graphic beautiful and the gameplay is simple yet it can pose a challange if ur not smart about it
I love this game. One of the best tactical RPG i've ever played.
"Got this game with DLC's on sale and it has given me 100+ hours of gameplay... and I haven´t even touched the DLC's missions. I like TBS games but the mechanics of this game make it much more dynamic and you feel more involved in the action, instead of just giving orders to your units. Keep in mind that this is a slow-paced game so it is not for everyone. Story is nice, sometimes predictable, but it will still give you some shocking moments to enjoy.     For a better experience:     Get in character, don't just play the game    Play for the story and forget the achievements... the moment I started trying to get an A-Rank in all missions is when I quit the game. Those skirmishes (replayable missions) are insanely difficult.    Read everything. This game has A LOT of text you can read. Although, it is not necessary, it will help you get all the details of the story. ( I didn´t read anything... you don´t miss anything crucial so don´t worry)    Japanese voices with english subtitles... the voice translation takes away all the emotion.     Price paid:  ...about $4 on a weekend sale (including all DLC's)"
"Nice adaptation, runs well on PC.  Loved the anime, love this game too."
Sega's hidden gem.  Valkyria Chronicles feels like a tatical 3rd person shooter hybrid with stragey elements. There are 4 different classes that feel balanced. The AI has a few problems but they can be challanging at times. I have played this and the second one. The games are solid and put together well.  Buy right away if:  You like anime and shooters.  It might be more of a sale for you if you do not like the graphics and anime drawings.
JUST PLAY IT FOR ALL YOU ANIME FANS OUT THERE...#EnoughSaid
"Great game, Characters are appealing and fun, Requires you to think about who you chose to send in for a certain mission... Also some real world logic applies, If you throw a grenade into a tank, It'll blow it up correct? It does that with radiators on a certain tank. The clutch was real"
"Great game!  Feeling guilty about buying it on 75% sale,it is worth buying full price."
+ Nice art style. Well adapted for this kind of game. + Good music. + Captivating story. Emotional from time to time. + Easy to learn combat system.  - Tank controls can be a bit annoying at times. - Minor feedback issues. Can't really think of any :P  Overall: Strong 9/10   Great game! Strongly recomend for both casual and challenge driven players. (Also recomend to play with controller if you can. Not necessary but I personally got a better experience from it.)
"Woefully underappreciated on the PS3, it finally gets its chance to shine on PC.   The sketchbook art direction is more than a look, its how the game is textured, and allows for deep customization for differing rigs and monitors.   Yet another excellent Drums of War soundtrack from Sakimoto. Great VA work as well (I miss Wittenberg).  Excellent strategy that allows for Stupid Things (aka player agency) in most every battle. The 'rush Scouts to win lolz' is overblown.  There's this wonderful attention to detail here, from uniforms to command structures to the level design that does a good 'video game adaptation of an anime rendition of a parallel dimension WW2' in all the right ways.  The story's alright for most of it; kinda stumbles here and there but keeps trucking. That is, until the last fifth where the game lurches to hit pre-determined storybeats and comes off with a nasty case of mood whiplash and bad sympathy.  Still, this is a classic that should be bought and most importantly, played."
Anime meets X-Com meets a third person shooter. I came across this game through a youtube video discussing great games that did not sell well. The art style caught my eye and the price on Steam was right. I have to say am really enjoying this game and its a shame that it is not more well known. Some of the cutscenes can become annoying at times but you can skip most and I find myself wanting to watch them more often to get more plot and exposition. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of turn-based strategy games.
"Don't let my hours fool you, I've played this game through about 15-20 times on the Playstation 3 and there is a reason.   One of the greatest JRPG's I have ever played and that used to be all I have played. Having a built in animated story along with extra missions adds replayability and plot immersion.   If you enjoy strategy JRPGs that have a great story line, OST, and character development than this is definitely one that you need to give a shot.   If you don't want to play the game, but like anime, there is an anime that basically is the entire game. Great watch even if you have played the game.   All in all, one of my most highly recommended games. Give it a try."
"I would recommend this game, but I can understand why some people dislike it. This is a turn-based squad tactics game with unique and unusual gameplay mechanics. There are five unit classes, which are pretty well balanced. Each turn you get a certain number of command points, which can be spent to buff your units and have them move and attack. You can use the points to move every unit once, or you can move some units multiple times, but the distance per move rapidly decreases as a unit is moved more times in a single turn. You also get a tank, which is powerful but slow and costs double points to move. While moving a unit, all enemies in range will be constantly firing at it, which lends a sense of urgency to your actions but turns off players who want time to look around and plan carefully. But since they only fire at the unit currently moving (or not at all if out of range/sight), this makes unrealistic and suicidal tactics valuable.  This ties into one of the main complaints against the game. In order to get the best rank (and therefore the most experience and money), you must focus on speed alone, and this requires those same unrealistic, suicidal rush tactics. Trying to follow the normal rules of squad combat will get generally get you a middling rank. You either have to give up hope of getting good ranks or give up the normal rules of combat and strategy. Some people hate that, but despite what some say the game never becomes impossible due to your troops falling behind since you can always play/grind skirmishes to level up. And you only get 50% more XP for an A rank compared to a C rank, so even if you stick to normal tactics you won't need too much grinding. Other ways that the game is unrealistic include 'magical' cover whereby a crouching enemy is 4x as hard to kill even if you flank them and a prone enemy is 8x as hard to kill. But it works just as well for you. The way I see it, you can embrace the fact that the game has unusual rules and try to form new strategies to win within them, or you can use normal strategies and consider getting A ranks to be a bonus minigame that you can play later if you want.  Other gameplay annoyances include dirty tricks where tough enemies and bosses may instantly spawn in the middle of or surrounding your men, even during your turn, and if you aren't prepared they might wipe you out. You may have no choice but to restart or reload and plan for their appearance.  The game lasts about 40-50 hours and includes a New Game+ mode. There's a good variety of mission types and maps. I never felt like the missions got repetitive. There are also two mini campaigns that you unlock after beating the game, which focus on different characters and change things up a bit.  The AI is really bad. It wastes about half of its command points, and generally relies on superior numbers and the fact that it almost always starts the mission holding all the good defensive positions.  As for the story, it's passable. I might even have called it good if it wasn't for the fact that it's full of bad cliches. There are also annoying points of incongruity in the game world. When characters can take a tank shell in the face and survive, and all wounds however grievous can be healed instantly with a touch of ragnaid, it feels very contrived when they suddenly become weak and helpless during cutscenes when the writers want to kill them off. And everyone just stands around crying rather than applying some ragnaid. It makes no sense, which robs those scenes of emotive power. Nonetheless, the story did its job of giving me a reason to keep fighting, and parts of it are interesting and moving.  The graphics are nice, although not up to PC standards. You can set the resolution to whatever you want, but in many cases it seems like the game internally renders at a fixed resolution and then upscales, so it's blocky no matter how high you set the resolution. The artsy rendering style is nice and mostly convincing. However, it's very 'cute', which might be a bit of a turn-off for some people. You're putting skinny teen and pre-teen anime girls in the field and they're killing people and then making cute girly poses. The whole game is a bit silly, but it didn't bother me.  The sound effects are good and the music is decent. The game includes both Japanese and English audio, which I appreciate.  The controls are buggy, especially if you play with a keyboard and mouse. There are weird, framerate-dependent bugs with the keyboard which might or might not affect you. I'd recommend using a gamepad like an XBox 360 controller instead, plus the mouse for aiming, but even then there are annoying bugs such as the game failing to filter out jitter and bounce in the analog sticks. (Depending on your gamepad, the cursor may sometimes become uncontrollable with the analog stick, but you can always use the D-pad.)  The user interface is kind of annoying. It's clearly a straight console port and no effort was made to improve it for the PC. For instance, even if you choose to use the keyboard in the configuration program, the game starts up and says 'Press START button'. There's no mouse support in menus. Etc. You also can't skip the many little boost cutscenes in battle, and while they're usually nice, sometimes they're tiring. The worst is that often they're totally unnecessary, like an anti-tank boost activating (with cutscene) when you're not shooting at a tank, or a healing boost when you're already at full health. Those are just a waste of time.  Overall, I enjoyed the game and thought it was worth the price. It has its flaws, but they're outweighed by the many fun aspects."
"Very original tactical strategy game. Does require a bit of reflexes, but it's really not the emphasis.  This is a really great game, with enjoyable story, rather simple but still interesting metagame, and mostly, a deep tactical combat game that is original, just challenging enough, well polished, and enjoyable."
"SO far im digging this game. Ive seen the anime I think last year, it was a good show. But this game gets better as i play. Its hard to stop playing . Great game. I was going to get the remastered version coming out in a month for my PS4 but said nevermind and got it on here. Everyone should try it out."
"it took me 43 bloody hours to beat this game, it's a hearthwarming story and i've been crying a few times while playing this story, worth every penny! i know there is an anime out there as well, but IMO this game is better, your hard work paying of, allthough the storyline is liniar it does seem you are actualy affecting the story. GREAT GAME! "
"Typical Japanese war game, shame the sale was so bad on ps3."
"My sniper is too OP, and too cute 10/10 would shot mofos on the head and do chuuni poses"
"I haven't put too much time into this game on pc but what I have played has functioned perfectly. This game is very worth your time - especially if you are into anime and enjoy WWII metaphors. This game was the primary reason I owned a PS3 during the last console generation. I am so thankful to see it on PC and Steam. My only critical complaints/comments would be that it is video and dialogue heavy. I liked that but some people may want to get to the gameplay faster than the game would have you do. The story is worth it though and you can skip cutscenes if you wish. My other critical comment/complaint is that some of the fights can be very challenging (to the point that they are unfair on first try) because of unknown elements suddenly being introduced part way in. I suppose strategy and tactics is accounting for the unknown but it still felt alittle cheap at times. All that said, the music, the story and the gameplay are top notch and worthy of your time and money if you have it. 9.7 out of 10."
"Game is phenomenal. I'm a huge fan of Tactical RPGs. Final Fantasy Tactics, Orgre Tactics, Fallout Tactics and the Disgaea series... I love the genre. This game fills that void for me in my steam collection. Story is pretty cool. Voice acting is pretty good, but the gameplay is where it shines. I'd recommend it to ANYONE! BUY IT!"
Good game... It's not great but i recommend it to anime/manga fans.
"exceptional! love to play it... no more odes necessary, just buy and play :]"
I love this game. I love it so much that I bought it on PS4 the day it came out. The combat is nice and takes more than guessing to win. Playing with a controller isnt as good as mouse and keyboard so id advise against it.
"Like World Wars? Like fictional World Wars? Like XCOM style gameplay but without as much RNG? well look no futher because Valkyrie Chronicles delivers it, with a rather pleasant gameplay and storyline to boot."
"This game is a very beautiful game! The concept art is becuatiful the music score is beautiful and calming. It really fits the game. As for the gameplay, XCOM fans will enjoy this kind of game. I am a fan of XCOM myself and this game gives some different challenges, but is similar enough for those kinds of things. I really enjoy the differences from XCOM in this game as well as the story. Stories are a good thing to have in video games, especially stories like this. I highly reccomend this game."
"Loved how this game put control back into the players hands.  The demand of strategy let me employ my mind and really let me feel invested. The action element let me do something that I wish XCOM would have, let me become and thus more immerse myself in the characters when it is their turn.  Whereas XCOM, you just delegate. Since I played this first, I felt let down by delegating instead of becoming the characters in other games.  Hence I put a lot of time into this. Would play the other games if released on steam."
"If you are a fan of JRPGs like I am i highly recommend this game for you, however, keep in mind that this game can be EXTREMELY frustrating and difficult so if you are looking for a challenge this may just be the game for you. Also think back to you younger days to the PS2 and recall (if you can) Dynasty Tactics, because this game is a lot like it. (though it probably won't help you strategy wise)"
"First things first, this game is heavily anime, so if you don't like anime, then it probably isn't for you.  Valkyria Chronicles is a fairly well-presented game across the board. It has a unique aesthetic resembling pencil-drawn paintings which is backed up by fluid character animations, a competent soundtrack, and a somewhat standard but decent voice-acting. On top of that, the PC port has been competently handled and runs very well, which is quite surprising considering it's from a Japanese publisher. These things combined hides the game's age very well, and it's hard to believe it's a game from 2008 judging by the spectular visuals.  However, while competent in presentation, Valkyria Chronicles' as a tactical RPG lacks severely in terms of strategy and pacing. The main problem being that the mechanics are too imprecise for any careful planning or tacitical thinking, with many of them hinging on chances to work: for example, every character you control in this game have different passive bonuses and debuffs depending on their personality, one of which being 'humanitarian', a trait that prevents the character from taking further action in the next turn after having killed a certain number of enemies. The 'number of enemies' needed to trigger this debuff is purely chance-based, you might get through an entire battle without it happening once, or you might get it right on the first turn. The entirety of the game is pretty much plagued by this RNG nonsense, which not only impede pacing but also rewards save scumming rather than clever tactics. It also isn't particularly well-optimised in terms of balance, as the scout class have the longest movement gauge and can absolutely devastate any opposition given the right equippment and/or status buff, negating the need to cooperate with the other classes.Besides the random nature of the core mechanics, the game's numerous design issues can also drag down your overall enjoyment, such as the TPS perspective used in controlling individual units, which while refreshing to see, doesn't blend very well with the turn-based system. The game also is bad at telling you about a lot of things, many of which being vital to a tactical game, such as how far your current movement gauge can get you, whether the enemy closeby can hit you, etc. The problems are numerous, but most of them boil down to the game's imprecision.  Controls for this game is alright for the most part save for the tank controls, however it's heavily hindered by the game's atrocious UI design. To quote from Yahtzee, it's very much designed by someone with his head stuck in a filing cabinet. There's next to no mouse navigation outside of combat (and even then it's very limited - you can't even use your mouse to navigate the menus!) and nearly all sections are sorted under separate tabs which can only be navigated with multiple keystrokes. The combat UI has very little in the way of displaying essential informations, such as your unit's current chance at scoring a hit, or the available covers on the map, areas which your tank can't traverse, etc. This adds a lot of frustration to unit management and what little planning there is to do in combat, practically killing the pacing.  Story wise it's a fairly ordinary anime plot with the standard plot points enacted by a cast of common anime character archetypes. The usual cliches are present and again, if you hate anime, then the story will annoy you to no end with its attempts at moral debates and philosophical grumbles, otherwise it's servicable. There are some enjoyable moments, and the game does a good job at making you care for the characters you control, as each one has their own personality quirks which also affects gameplay (but unfortunately aren't always reliable due to reasons mentioned above), and there's perma-death for all but characters vital to the story, giving you the incentive to keep your soliders alive. If you love playing with anime tropes, then the large roster of characters will definitely comes as a treat.  All in all, Valkyria Chronicles is beautifully presented but mechanically flawed. If you are looking for a good strategy experience, then you won't find it here. However, it is fairly enjoyable if you can forgive its underwhelming gameplay and slow pacing. If you have a thing for anime and likes to dubble in a game with some casual strategy elements, then by all means try it out."
"Addictive and enjoyable, fun gameplay and a good backstory."
Came in expecting a cheesy anime game with Sega levels of polish (Barely any) and managed to get a stunning and depressing World War Two game. The main characters are all enjoyable and believably written so its easy to get attached. Even the generic soldiers you recruit into your squad are all unique and enjoyable. While the permadeath system can be annoying at times it adds a layer of urgency to whenever your units get knocked out. And it can lead to you staying up til 2 AM trying to beat a level with your waifus alive (Looking at you Jane and Elysee)
"I haven't beaten the game BUT I had a whole ton of fun playing it,story is awesome,characters are interesting,gameplay is addictive and overall it's AMAZING. I won't go into detailed stuff but if you enjoy 'chinese cartoons' and strategies you'll definetely enjoy this one. P.S Largo pls hit."
"This is one of my top greatest Japanese imports of all time , it's up there with FF3/FF7 , Chrono Trigger , Guardian Heros , Tactics Ogre ect ect.. A great mix of turn based strategy and RPG story with close ties to our WW2 set in a fictional steam punkish world that has some of the greatest art and design ever IMO. Visual upgrades to units. Strengths and weakness of each unit will make you think carefully about how to use them. As a bonus , you get all the DLC from the console version.  Cons: Some crashing still occurs , so save OFTEN."
This game is a gem. It really is. The art is awesome.  Truly an amazing turn based squad tactics game for the ages.
"If your on the fence about buying this game, don't hesitate, because it's fantastic. It's a strategic JRPG with a hearwarming story, memorable characters, and overall enjoyable gameplay. Even if your not into JRPG's, I'd recommend you give it a shot.  Also, Alicia is best waifu."
"Ive played this a few times and can honestly say its a really superb A1+ game. Its engaging, funny, challenging, exciting and beautiful. Some games leave me feeling ive taken part in an important story - this does some games - like DAI - leave me feeling my times been wasted - this doesnt Theres no filler - it's all purposeful game play.  So in a few short words a bunch of quirky kids have to save their country from invasion. possessing various personalities, worries - such as getting the uniform dirty LOL - and skills you set off to fight the bad guys, its not some obtuse plot that uses over complication as a substitute for  imagination. Along the way you upgrade weapons and skills and recruit new characters. The graphics are really sweet, nice gentle water colors. I find in many games that over complicated poorly harmonised graphics just look gaudy and intense. These graphics are a joy to the eye.  Dialogue is also sweet, endearing, often genuinely funny and respectfully succinct, i didnt have to click through dialogue screens that are just there to fill the game.  Its a joy. Roll on 2 and 3 coming to Steam."
A very good turn based game though it's an old game now. I would have bough it even it had sold in a full price. The story is quite good but quite slow at the beginning. The combat is quite difficult. I spent 50 hrs to finish the main story. There are Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 but unfortunately they are not on Steam!
"This game is a really good AP-based, Turn-Based Strategy (AP-based meaning that each time you select a unit, they have only a certain limit to what they may do in a turn). It has four different infantry classes, plus a tank which you get early on, which all can work together to make the tactics and strategy of the game very dynamic and interesting, plus the story is genuinely interesting and you get to know and love the characters you command through the battles you fight. Overall, it's a very good purchase, *especially* with such a good price tag - the game is old, so it's not sold for as much anymore, but it has very honestly lost nothing in gameplay or looks in its age.  The singular complaint I would bring up is that there are a few missions (spread out across the whole game) that are *absurdly*, stupidly more difficult and obnoxious than the rest of the game, and usually because of the same, ridiculous opponent showing up in the battle. In order to win, you're forced to abruptly use new strategies and mechanics that, until that mission, didn't exist and couldn't be used, and upon reaching the level are inadiquately explained and poorly utilized. It's very much a slap in the face, both in terms of the immersion and flow of the game, and also in terms of the enjoyment you get out of it. To put it bluntly: those missions will not be fun, and they may even ruin the game for some people. And that's very sad, because apart from those levels, the game is absolutely wonderful. So, frankly, when you hit those levels, cheat, save-scum, whatever; just get past them, then get back to enjoying this really truly amazing game."
This is a long challenging game filled with characters and story. Very very addicting combination of TPS and Turn-Based strategy!
Beautiful art style and well ballanced cinematic vs action style in combat. Some extended sequences aren't for the action minded and sometimes 'the AI is a cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥' but makes for a very nice playthrough.
Need more!
"A great anime style 3rd person turn-based video game. It is very reminicent of Fire Emblem, but with added 3rd person shooter elements mixed in nicely. The writing is a bit cheesy and has a few anime cliches, but it somehow works to make it more endering. Overall, it is very enjoyable and interesting."
"just finished this brilliant game. it is story driven, turn based strategy about militia regiment fighting in secound europan war (europa is an fictional continent reasemling our own). 9.5/10"
Not Bad with a touch story and Challenging Strategy battlefield. This game can became addictive if you like to solve strategy battle. So stressfull but is enjoyable XD
"Amazing strategy game, kinda like Xcom but alot better in my opinion. The scenery, storyline, music, atmosphere, characters, everything is really unique Cant believe im only playing this game now. However i wish it werent so slow paced and repeatative but i still highly recommend it."
"played valkyria chronicles 2 on psp first so i was ok with the mechanics , loved the artwork"
i like it but again how would you know if аm human or a dog .... INTERNET :)
"What can I say that hasn't already been said, Valkyria Chronicals is simply an amazing game. For me it was the first time encountering a game using a combination of active movement and turn based combat. In comparison to a game like Final Fantasy and other such turn based rpgs this game stands in a unique light, and unfortunately one of very few games that makes an attempt to use such a game play style. Overall the Music and sound design is superb, it does a excellent job of displaying the emotional value of a scene or making the moment more intense and thrilling for the player. The use of a book/journal to display chapters and other content like character bios, world information locations/weapons etc is perfect and fits the esthetic of the game. With a roster of 50+ characters its near impossible to walk away without a dozen favorites whether it be aesthetically or personality wise.  Overall its the perfect game, especially for those like myself who enjoy some strategic thinking. Not to say the game is overly difficult, but the unique gameplay, meshing of anime/war and watercolor style visuals really gives players a fresh taste and leaves me certainly wanting more.  Highly recommended."
"really like this game, bought it on sale, played a little while, and got fed up of all the cut scenes, but peservered a couple of months later, and it's a pretty darn good game, well worth a look, pretty graphics, good turn based gameplay, yes, great alround, 90/100,"
"100% ed this game, its actually a good game but the ranking/point system destroys the whole strategic point of the game, because all that matters is how fast you finish the mission so you just rushing through it, otherwhise you wont get an a ranking and that isnt really fun."
based raita
"This was one of the first games I bought for my PS3 back in the day, and I've recommended it ceaselessly since then. It's a marvelous combination of turn-based and (pseudo)real time tactical action. The artwork is stellar and the story is beatuful.  This games remains one of best games I've ever played, on any platform. Highly recommended!"
"an RPG + Third Person point of view. some of you may dislike that, but for most of people, it's unique and enjoyable. Recomendded."
Good  Pretty fun tactical turn-based shooter.
"Valkyria chronicles is a nice gem on both anime themed and strategy game. you command one squad trought to the war in story rich turn based strategy game where you move your troops using 3rd person camera with WASD control.  Graphics and SFX are nice and smooth anime like. The game using music as powerful tool transfering emotions and is very movie like sometimes. AI has his cons ( e.g there is rarely deadly enemy mortar stikes or enemy come at you one by one) but know how to make a worthy opponent.   The controls are fine but character movement are glitchy. The footsoldiers are easy to handly even if they are stuck in sandbags or something. Your tank(s) are different story they are stuck in every second when they can. The first this can be a proplem but not so long when you get used for it.   I like a game mechanic. You maintain your troops in metagame and gaming part itself includes three phases; deploy, command, movement/attack. you see commander battle map with all known intel and there you select your unit when you change wiew on the battlefield where you move your unit like 3rd person shooter (like I mentioned earlier also). This is unique and I like it. I know there was game using same style back in 90's if I recall but please if you know some others let me know.   In short   Pros:   - Good story ( there is anime adaption of this with more drama if you are interested) - Enjoyable appearance ( menus are pretty and relaxing) - Graphics as general ( if you like anime style) - Voice acting ( lines are somethimes awful but acting is still solid) - Game mechanic (look above) - Character design ( the main characters have all interesting personality)    Cons:   - AI ( You can't get guard down. Sometimes minor mistake cost battles but usually if you think your moves you can't lose. And Sometimes AI kill itself) - Movement ( clumsy is best what you can get even you get used to it) - cliché ( usually you can quess almost everything but what welkin try to say next) - visual novel style (When characters communicate there is usually visual novel like portrait screen, we can thank PSP root of thes game for that)"
Very good game. Absolutely loved it
"Action from both the commander's 'strategic' overhead point of view and your soldiers' 'tactical' third-person point of view makes for unique, interesting gameplay. The art style has aged well; high-resolution and high-framerate support keeps in-game visuals clear, but watch out for the 720p pre-rendered cutscenes.  If you want a WWII-flavored, anime-styled tactics game that's *somewhat* grounded in reality (and has a decent story), give it a go!  8/10 High Quality PS3 Port"
"Gallia, 1935 ec. You are Welkin Gunther, the son of a war hero living a quiet life in a small border town, content to spend your days in peace. But that peace is soon shattered as an invading army razes your hometown to the ground. Determined to enlist in the militia and protect your country, you set out in your late father's tank with a plucky girl named Alicia at your side and your adoptive sister Isara at the controls. As citizen soldiers of a small country caught between two military powerhouses, take command of Militia Squad 7 and overcome the odds in a heartwarming and heartwrenching story of love, loss and camaraderie in the face of war...  Valkyria Chronicles is an interesting mixing pot of a game where many different elements all come together in a uniquely effective final result. Storywise, you have war account influences reminiscent of Band of Brothers, the 2008 movie Defiance, Saving Private Ryan, and other such period pieces delivered in a mixture of cinematics and visual novel-esque prompt sections. As with all war tales, not every member of the invaders is an evil, faceless minion who must be wiped off the face of the earth, and not every soldier on your side is particularily noble and heroic. When recruiting your squadmates, you'll have to pick and choose between characters whose traits and attitudes may make life harder for your team as a whole, especially as you get to know them over time.  This blend continues in gameplay, where you have a turn-based phase combat system with the unit classes from Battlefield, with strategies and attacks that become easier and more rewarding as you level up your squad and purchase more effective weapons. Each class levels up as a whole, so don't worry about individually tending to the xp of all twenty members of your squad. Also, for all the soldiers you select to join, there is a permadeath system akin to the one that made State of Decay so horribly effective: When a soldier hits 0 HP, they collapse. If a friendly unit doesn't walk up to them and call for a medic within three turns, or an enemy soldier reaches them first, they die. Permanently. It adds a jarring realism to a formidably tense combat scenario.  The artwork follows suit as well, with a sort of canvas painting feel to the world with a sprinkling of Borderlands sound effects cues thrown in, all wrapped up in a pristine anime/manga character design package. The score is hauntingly beautiful and stirringly motivational at ideal moments, and knows when to assist the scene in throwing the player through an emotional loop. 'Succeeded Wish,' in particular, along with its variants, weaves in and out of the musical cues, pushing you forward, helping you recover, and renewing your hope.  A side note to anime sub purists, or those so inclined: Yes, the original Japanese audio is included in the Steam release and can be accessed right as you start the game in the options menu. For everyone else, including me, I had no problem with the English Dub. In fact, aside from a few word substitutions and the rare odd read, the English voice cast did a phenominal job with VC. And besides, in a setting that is heavily influenced by Central Europe in between World Wars, it seems slightly more fitting to have a European language spoken. It's like the Hellsing/Hellsing Ultimate factor.   Included with the Steam release is access to the DLC packages, including high level Skirmish Maps and Challenges and a pair of side stories that add their own unique twist to the main narrative. For those who wish to avoid major spoilers for the main game, refrain from playing these stories until after Chapter 11, at least. By far the more beneficial of the two is the 'Behind Her Blue Flame' story, which has a further humanizing effect on the invading army and a fantastic reward which becomes useable in the main game upon completion.  With all this in mind, I fullheartedly recommend Valkyria Chronicles for anime/manga fans, WWI and/or WWII history buffs, and the strategic minded player who loves a good challenge. Squad 7, move out!  9/10"
"This is definetely a great title in the world of tactical RPG.  The art and visual are gorgeous, the story and gameplay are compelling. Also, the replay value is quite good if you've enjoyed yourself, since there are many hidden items and perks to unlock all along the campaign. Overall, the game is well balanced : it's very accessible, but has depth.  Finally, if you are concerned by the PS3 to PC port : it's really OK (I didn't suspect a thing)."
"Ah, Valkyria Chronicles. I had heard the name a few times but I had no idea what this game was about until it got ported to Steam. It seemed fairly interesting to me, so I bought in on sale. I was surprised how great it is.  A mixture between real-time and round-based strategy, you and the opponent take turns moving your units over the battlefield. Doing so switches from an overview map to third-person perspective of the unit you're moving so you can aim and shoot at your enemies yourself. While you're moving, the enemy units can counterfire, so you need to carefully move to a spot where you're not instant cannon fodder. The different unit classes are all unique, with their own strengths and weaknesses and the various battlefield hazards make every battle different. You can choose the soldiers in your army yourself, and they all have their own 'potentials', perks that randomly activate and can have positive or negative effects. This gives the characters shape and makes them more than just foot soldiers; for example, you shouldn't bring a unit with Desert allergy into a dune skirmish, and Lone Wolfs work best when shooting the enemy from their own little corner.  Aside from these fairly complex mechanics, the game offers a very well-developed story set in a World War scenario, with supernatural elements mixed in (in form of the name-giving Valkyrias). There are so many cutscenes between the battles that it sometimes feels like playing a visual novel. This can be a pro or a con, depending on your personal preference. There is an option to use the original japanese audio instead of english. I recommend the japanese audio because the english voice actors seem to kind of exaggerate their pronounciation (even on characters like Largo who always talk in slang), but thats my personal preference.  The graphics in the game look outdated (the game is 6 years old by now!) and the anime style may not appeal to everyone. It still looks fairly good, though.   All things considered, Valkyria Chronicles is a great game and well worth its full price on Steam, despite being a PS3 port. The mixture of interesting story and engaging gameplay make for a very good package."
anime is good
Anime X-COM with more planning and less RNG.  The only downside is the scarce modding and less replayability.  Tons of waifus if you are into that.  10/10 Would liberate Gallia again.
"This is maybe the most interesting game i ever played. The story, graphics and characters are very good. And the most i love from this game is there are a lot of strategies we can use to defeat our enemies.  Try it and you will know why i really love this game :D"
"For a Strategy RPG, especially coming from the perspective of a PC gamer, the sad fact is that you'll be getting very little RPG and very little Strategy from Valkyrie Chronicles  On the RPG side you have next to nothing to work with. If you're looking for immersive story and dialogue, look elsewhere. You're stuck watching stilted slide-show cutscenes with no interaction or dialogue choices. You, as a player, will have zero influence on the story.   Dialogue isn't the only place where the RPG is light to non-existant. Troop customization is extremely limited. You won't be customising individual soldiers and will instead be 'advancing' types of solders. I put advancing in quotes because all advancement is linear. You don't pick and choose how you want to develop your team, you just move them along a progression line and assume they're getting better at... something. Upgrading your tank is a bit more divergent, and almost does enough to qualify the game as an RPG... except that you get enough resources that the choices are meaningless.   The strategic elements of the game are also limited. Having played through a few skirmishes and about 15 hours into the main story, I have not seen any indication of a credible AI. Enemies are obviously acting on a few simple if-then scripts that are easily confused and can be easily abused. Frequently the AI will choose to shuffle around random units back and forth off-screen rather than continue taking shots with their tank or sniper that has clear LOS. The most challenging parts of combat are dealing with design flaws like the wonky tank controls and the off-skewed aiming reticule that causes shots to hit obstacles you thought you could shoot over/around.    All of that could be forgiven if not for the horrible nature of the PC porting itself. It's bad. Dark Souls 1 bad (without the benifit of the fan-made patches). Worse, even."
Good  Pretty fun tactical turn-based shooter.
"Just finished this game. Couldn't help but write a review. The game is really enjoyable if you are a fan of animes and/or strategy games. The story is fun to watch. The accompanying soundtrack is good. The gameplay is really fun if you don't resort to cheap exploits (alicia's potentials come to mind) Except for issues in balancing alicia(  plot details  ), the game is a really good package. Easily worth the asking price of $19.99 for 35 hours of fun.(considering it lasted me more than rise of the tomb raider and deus ex both of which came for $60 and lasted only 8 hours for rottr and 18 hours for deus ex with all side missions and complete stealth play)"
"10/10 Game. Finished 4/01/17 at 20 Hours.  Pros: - Fantastic Story - Fun and creative battles - Great progression system - A happy ending that's totally worth it - Wonderful Soundtrack - Cell shaded anime art style is superb - New game plus - Includes all DLC, perfect.  A few complaints: - One mission in particular where enemies can call for reinforcements without a base camp. I guess that's just the way they designed that particular mission. - When assuming control of one of your soldiers, enemies can shoot you for a breif second causing you damage if you're scout rushing, you sit there for 1 second taking damage before you can actually move."
Are you a closet weeabo who likes World War 2 and turn-based strategy games? Then Valkyria Chronicles is probably already in your library.
"Looks great but kinda hard sometimes, IMHO. Reminds me of Final Fantasy Tactics difficulty."
Company of Waifus: Sugoi Tales  Pretty mediocre though 2bh. You can easily finish the game using only 2 units.
