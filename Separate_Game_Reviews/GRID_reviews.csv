review_text
"I've played this game for nearly 6 years (my Steam hour count would tell you different). I used to own the CD version which never used steam, I've put MUCH more hours than a measly 40+into this game. So, I finally decided I should write a review about one of my most beloved racing games in gaming ever.   I love this game, it is no secret to my friends, family and probably my neighbours (the outragous roars from car engines and crashes most likely shake the walls). I've always wanted more and more people to try and play this game, my passion. I have a long term passion for ANYTHING motorsport, be this Moto GP, BTCC, Formula 1 and all the way up to prestigious Le mans 24. Race Driver: GRID manages to capture a real genuine feel of BEING a REAL race driver in a REAL team, after you have finished a few races you are able to set up a team. Later on, bring in a team mate (fair few to choose from each having different discipline specialities and stats). You can create a livery (albeit from a rather limited customization level) and obviously, give your team a name. Within races you will have a team engineer talk to you from time to time to update you on damage to the car or, whether an opponent has spun and who is leading the race. Your team mate ALSO makes communication with you but, this is primarily used to tell you where he is on track. All of this combined along with having a personalized garage of cars allows for complete immersion (for me atleast) into the world of 4 wheeled motosport.   The career being the main SP experience of the game is split up into 3 different categories: USA, EUROPE and JAPAN. The USA focuses more on Street type tracks, Muscle cars and GT1-2 spec cars. EUROPE is focused on Tourers, open wheel and endurance type races. These mostly play out on race tracks such as SPA, Jarama, Germany's famous Nurburgring and Donington Park. Japan goes the route of drifting, Touge and Tuners. Tuners being beefed up Nissan Skylines and Honda NSX's (My favourite tuner). There is also a GLOBAL catagory that unlocks once the player has reached 10,000,000 REP points (this combines all regions 3 into one). You have a liscense for EACH of these locales that levels up as you complete races and earn REP (XP). One you select an event or race, you can select your difficulty, assists and what-not. Turning all the assists off and boosting the difficulty can boost REP dramatically.  This career mode is also split by seasons (there is no obvious prgress through a season) but, it seems to consist of 5-10 finished races per time. These are unlimited and are used to promote the played with entering a 24 Hour Le mans race, either as a hired driver for another team or allowing the player to enter his/her own team. This race is 20 minutes (realtime) and transitions to night time then back throughout, with some big money payouts it's hard to say no a lot of the times. This event CAN be skipped whenever the offer arises the player is never forced to enter the Le mans race.   Outside of the main team progession there is also an option called 'driver offers' this takes you to a screen that randomizes 3 events for the player to choose from. You wll be racing for other teams whilst also using the car listed on the event. You will have certain objectives to complete and the payouts are much higher sometimes.   Now, lets talk about gameplay, that IS what you are here for right? Let me make it clear to you that this is NOT A SIMULATOR, sure each car has it's own behaviour and feel but, Codemasters have found the perfect balance between real and arcade. Sometimes the cars can feel floaty but, that's usually fixed if using a wheel with some decent forcefeed back. Each discipline does feel almost completley different from one another, Formula 3's for example really need to be tamed with decent accelerator control. I recomend playing with a wheel, manual gears, ALL assists off and blast a Formula 3 around Okutama (Grand Circuit). GRID manages to capture the intensity of speed insanely well, the amount of times I have skipped a heart beat whilst driving GT2's, Prototypes and Formula 3's are un-countable; it's incredible. The vehicular damage in the game has some of the more accurate damage in gaming. You smash your front left of a wall and you will feel it. do something to your engine you'll know about it but, there is much more than just these two examples that can happen. Endless possibilities for damage.   This game is just genuinly FUN and fluid to play. It is one of the more simpler racing games to play, it's not complicated, there's no rule book, the AI is genuinly decent and very aggressive and it's completly immersive with amazing engine and ambient sounds. The game visually still holds up but, it does have a rather odd spepia like filter over it, there is a MOD availible called the 'Dargos Mod'. Not hard to find, it makes the game look crystal clear by removing the sepia and adding some beautiful colour.   Thanks for taking the time to read my review, I'm sure by now you have come to the conclusion that I just love this game. If you have any questions about the game please, give me a bell.   10/10."
better than grid 2  10/10
Released in 2008 Still holding as the best racing game ever made.
"It should have ended here, the first GRID is the only one worth it's money."
The Best 'Restart Race' Simulator. Unregrettably spent 2.59 .
i think this game speaks for itself ! Old = Gold 10/10  I Recommended you a Guide:        Aussiedroid's GRiD Bonus Codes &amp; Extras&nbsp;
"I managed to pick this game up on sale for $4.99. If you are looking for an above average, arcade-simulation racing game at a budget price, look no further than GRID.    Pros:"
"This game is amazing. It's hard to sum up the satisfying feeling of scoring first place on the last stretch, or of beating your previous time on the track by precious seconds, or of spinning out and causing a pileup of every car in the race. Events are varied enough that no two are the same, and between frustrating Japanese drift contests, superfast F1 races, grueling 24 hour events and deadly demoliton derbies, there's bound to be something enjoyable. Car selection is limited, with some events only using one car type, but the garage is large enough to be satisfying. After completing several challenges and forming your own team, you can chose your number, team colors, car patterns, and sponsors, all of which are extremely in-depth. Buy the game, it's worth it."
"The first and also the best Grid game! It has a detailed cockpit view, unlike Grid Autosport... The graphics are pretty good for a 2008 game.  I still play it regularly even though it's 6 years old by now. The SP is great (I spent around 25-30 hours to complete the SP), this game is definately worth it's money!   Pro's: - Detailed cockpit view - Single Player - Graphics - Physics (mix between arcade and realism) - Damage model - LAN play via Hamachi  Cons: - Online does not work anymore"
"Possibly THE BEST arcade/semi-simulation racing game out there! 40 hours into it, and I'm still playing it daily! Yes, online servers went down awhile ago, but the offine single-player career mode is excellent. Damage mode isn't as well as Burnout Paradise...but hey just saying that is a complement! I like how the CPUs themselves would spin out/make mistakes on their own. I really, really, cannot recommend it enough. I got it on sale for $3, best 3 i've ever spent! GET IT NOW!"
"8/10 GRID is a racing game that did not let you drive like crazy and crashing all the stuff in your way (just like in Need For Speed) nor it is too realistic to give you penalty for driving through the grass or disqualified you for just losing a front bumper (like in F1) . So this game has a nice balance between realism and arcade, that is what makes this game is enjoyable and fun for casual gamers and racing enthusiast alike. This game also welcomed newbie or pro racing gamer. For newbie you can turn on all the driving assist in the game so the driving will be more simple and easy to learn, or if you feel like racing game is your everyday life you can turn off all the driving assist for more complex driving and customize the driving options so the car will perform like what you expect.  As for the graphics, although this is an old game (realeased in 2007) the graphics of this game is still feel good and comparable to current game graphics. The best thing about the graphics is the car crash effect, it looks so realistic !! see it for yourself here         YouTube™ Video:  GRID Crash Compilation - Part 1/3&nbsp;"
THIS GAME IS 8 YEARS OLD AND IT STILL LOOKS BETTER THAN ANY RACING GAME THESE DAYS.
Best racing game on the PC!
"Holy ♥♥♥♥ does this game really instill the adrenaline rush associated with racing. Far superior than grid 2, and it's a fierce bit of fun to play with cockpit-mode only."
"Finished it four times over. Only game I've ever been close to good at, therefore it's the best game ever."
This is one of the best racing games on Steam. The graphics still hold up and the AI puts up a challenge. You can find DLC for it called Presitge and 8 ball that add more cars. On a sale you can pick this up for $3 so it's a just a staple kind of racing game like pole position was to the Atari. Everyone that plays PC games should have this game.
"This is the best racing game I've ever played. It's a perfect balance between realistism and fun. The graphics are amazing, the controls are satisfying, and the options/features are icing on the cake. Oh, and did I mention there are some sweet cars?"
"This racing game is one of my favorite all time. It's graphics considering it's got several years on it already are still really good looking. The handling model can be adjusted to fit a simulator or arcade style of racing which I like. You can make the game easy or hard. The damage model in the game is one of the better ones around as well. Crash into a wall you can knock off some fenders or something or you can bend your wheels and your car will pull to one side or another. You can critically damage your car or keep it clean if you are a good driver.  The physics model in the game is also very solid. The fact you can get hit, spun, flip and it all feels very weighted and normal is amazing. You can hit a lump in the grass while sliding sideways and start flipping and it seems real (my record for flips is like 14 if you are wondering haha) It's a truly fun game. My only complaint is because it is an older game the online servers are down (as far as my knowledge they are) But overall for a single player racing game if you can catch this one on a good buy you will not regret it.  I would give this game a 95/100 for single player use only. (multiplayer is down as a reminder)"
"Grid is difficult. Exceptionally difficult. Even for a seasoned racing gamer such as myself. Needless to say, you will need some time to adjust to the challenge. Motion blurring is set to default, and I am still unsure what makes the game look better or more realistic. I have personally turned it off. GRID's general visual appearance seems to be hazy to begin with (from dust, smoke, etc), and this cannot be changed. Winning races or achieving podium finishes is desirable, but not mandatory, as you will still earn money for yourself and the team. The replay/flashback system works well and allows you to correct some of your driving mistakes per race. Personalizing your cars' colors, numbers, and patterns is limited but very nice. Sponsor decals placement is also fun and interesting to look at, as real brands are used. Unfortunately, you cannot upgrade your car parts. All you are allowed to do is purchase and sell cars, new or used. Some cars handle horribly, even if they are very expensive. GRID has some voice acting, and all I have heard was excellent. Depending on the person's origin, even their accent will be different and localized. Your team's employee and teammate will often relay important and informative radio messages to you. Damage received from driving is of great detail for all cars participating in the race. The damage incurred to the tracks are also vivid and lively, including tires, barricades, and railings. Even if you cannot get a podium finish at any race, you are allowed to retry it any time, for as many times as you would like. Although GRID is supposed to be more arcade style than a simulation, the way the cars and tracks feel surpass my expectations greatly. All competitions are challenging, requiring much effort from the player in order to win. As you go higher up the license levels, the difficulty becomes even more strenuous, if that was even possible. The difficulty makes the game so frustrating, that you will not bare to play for more than about two hours at a time. Because of the steep difficulty, winning gives you the experience of true accomplishment. Skill developing in this game is masterful and rewarding. Every single race is tense and exciting, every single time you try. There is a limited amount of tracks with alternative routes, but racing in them never gets boring. The rivalries you will develop between other drivers is a lot of fun. Scouting for and hiring teammates is also extremely interesting. If you hire a highly skilled teammate, he will be your biggest rival and toughest opponent in most races. Sometimes, your teammates become real nuisances, as they bang, scrape, and tip your car off the track. The Drift races are my absolute favorites. They are extremely fun, and are full of non-stop action at every turn. The game seems to have crashing issues during saving times and quitting times. As far as the starting grid goes, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. There are no qualification steps at all, and it seems that the starting grid is determined at random, which makes it rather silly, unrealistic, and as if you were excluded from a part of the competition. The career mode is somewhat incomplete if you expect GRID to be a total simulation. There are truly no means of securing your own earned starting grid position, nor are you able to tweak your cars. Once you win all events, become the number one driver in the world, and your team becomes the number one team in the world, the game presents you with a prestige opportunity to race against a famous driver from a famous team. This particular race is one-on-one and the difficulty setting is adjusted to Extreme and you are only allowed to flashback one single time. This makes the race close to impossible. The cars, tracks, physics, effects, sounds, and environments are beautiful. There is a lot of excitement and fun to be had with GRID. In the end, this is one of the most frustrating games I have ever played in terms of difficulty. The lack of preliminary race steps, qualification laps, vehicle tweaking, and customization leaves a lot of detail to be desired. There is a lot to love in GRID, but there is also enough frustration.  GRID is great."
"This is the funnest racer I've played since the old (pre-2000) Need For Speed days. It's an arcade game, not a simulator. The XBOX360 controller worked well with no configuration needed.  The game revolves around The 24 Hours of Le Mans, During career mode -- where I had to run Le Mans 21 times before completing the game -- the 24 hours are compressed into 12 minutes. I love the day &amp; night transitions.  Grid is not that serious of a game, however. Alongside fictional circuit courses there are also various drift events and even downhill, nighttime, canyon races against traffic.  The AI does have a catchup element, but I didn't even notice it until the last few hours of the game.  There is a good selection of cars. Most cars handle quite differently than each other.  A big complement is that the AI occasionally makes big errors. That is a realistic feature that is missing from many games.  At normal settings, your car can take quite a beating, There are hard difficulty levels, but I'd say the base difficulty is good for casual gamers, assuming you do use the driver assists. Personally, since they do use traction control at Le Mans, I don't mind using especially without a force-feedback wheel-and-pedals setup. Again, it's not a realistic simulator. It's a fun arcade game.  My chief complaint would be that the races are too short, but that's a two-edged blade. If the race is too easy, you don't want to race so long that you keep lapping second place. If the race is too hard, you don't want to spend too long limping to the finish line. It's just a feature of human experience that we want longer races when they're good races. I'd have liked them to be longer in general though.  I do wish we even had some kind of fake pitstops for trying to run a full 24 hours of Le Mans. I'm not so delusional that I don't expect to need some damaged repaired if I make an error after 12 hours. Moreso, the game also needs a save feature for extended races. The game does autosave your rankings in between events, but you cannot leave in the middle of race and continue it.   It took me 40 hours to complete the career mode, and I have started a second career at harder difficulty and am playing stand-alone events. This game is worthwhile in hours per dollar."
"Forget about driving in NFS and Irl. Whenever you start driving in GRID, you'll realize how much you suck at driving. Your driver skills are NONE.  Also, you'll die in a terrible crash.  10/10"
"This game is awesome and fun, you can play multiplayer with your friends, graphics, they are very nice. GRID &gt; GRID2"
Old but Gold !
"A great game! Awesome graphics and spectacular damage modelling. Still holds very strong after 8 years.  Downloaded the DLC for free, adds awesome content!  DLC Link:  http://www.moddb.com/mods/8-ball-prestige-packs-dlc-pc/downloads/8-ball-prestige-packs-dlc-pc "
"+Fun arcady simulation +No abs braking option + Team management system -Ugly yellow tint on everything  Its just a fun game. Not too serious but not too lax.  It's refreshing not having the option to disable abs braking. It adds an extra level of difficulty, knowing slamming on the brakes too hard will lock up your tires and render your steering input useless.  You get to create a paint scheme for your team, choose sponsors that reward you for winning, and hire a team mate. Its all stuff you really don't see anywhere. It really sets this game apart.  UGLY YELLOW TINT EVERYWHERE. I don't know why codemasters thought it was a good idea to make everything in the game look yellow from the sun."
"One of the better racing [series] that you can throughly experience a world of racing in.   I've played this game since day one on the Xbox 360, and when switching to the PC I found the switch tough. The screen resolution wasn't the best and it actually looked better on the 360 in my opinion. BUT by deleting a hardware restriction file, options for 1080p are available. Stunning.  I have all 3 methods of controlling vehicles and I have to say using a racing wheel is my favorite. It's realistic, and sliding a drift car around at an angle of 30+ degrees is a lot of fun. Xbox controllers are still very usable and for a new player, might be the way to go since the keyboard has you pressing keys to turn left/right around sweeping corners. It keys annoying with a keyboard.  11/10 best racing game of my childhood (Forza was fun too) and I am really looking forward to new development in the future. Codemasters did a fine job and the third installment, Autosport, is stellar."
"Ok , I played that game for 7 hours. Right - 7 . That was enough for me to write that review .   First of all : This one is the best of its kind . I never saw a better racing simulator on a PC  *Awesome Physics *Nice Cars *Cool Graphics *1-20 cars on one track *Real Challenge!  You need to know how to drift on that game, it is not that hard to learn it, but there actually is some challenge, so you'd better be ready for it :3  If you are a fan of Racing games and Simulators - You should get that game"
"I bought this game on sale a long time ago, and didn't get to play it much because of some severe issues with the control configuration, swerving back and forth horribly. Well, I readjusted some settings, I forget which, and then I got to play it. And damn, was it worth it. It's an absolutely gorgeous game with an interesting mix between arcade and simulation style racing, getting just as in-depth as you want it to be.  The GRID World mode is essentially your average career mode, but it allows you a lot of choice in regards to what events you participate in. A wide list of event options is open to you, some events being a new style of racing to get accustomed to and some (like Demolition Derby) being one-offs. You'll earn respect in each jurisdiction for impressive finishes, and you'll earn more of it for self-imposed challenges like turning up the difficulty, turning off assists, and most boldly, entirely disabling the option to restart a race from the pause menu. Like I said, it's as in-depth as you want it, so if you want to go hardcore, the game will respect that and reward you accordingly. Even on a low difficulty, though, I still managed to accrue some high levels of respect for consistent victories. Also, I noticed that just when I felt like I was running out of events to play, a new tier of them unlocked, leaving more and more to play even when I started seeing the same locations repeatedly.  The Flashback feature is a godsend. Screwed up somewhere? Go to the instant replay, rewind, and hit the button (WARNING: F12 is one of the buttons) to continue the race right from there. You only have a limited supply of them, though, and if you went for Pro Mode to disable restarting from the pause menu, you get no Flashbacks either.  Some event types will get on your nerves, no doubt about it, and teammates will often be a pain. But more often than not, GRID is a quite thrilling experience that really gives you the feeling of managing your own team, from choosing your sponsors (which offer different challenges to earn your payout, such as finishing in a certain place) to choosing your teammate. Once you get up into those higher ranks on the driver leaderboards, you'll look back and think, 'I earned this'."
"TL;DR: 8/10, would use as an alternative for an adrenaline epipen.  So I bought this game not really knowing what to expect. I'm into racing games, but mostly the Need For Speed series. This game is certainly the most unique racing game I've played. Keep in mind that I haven't played NFS: ProStreet or Shift, so I can't make a comparison with those games.  GRID is a racing game that attempts to simulate a professional's driving career, and in my opinion, succeeds for the most part. You're allowed to create your own team name, colors, and run just about everything else. You can buy cars, hire drivers to gain more points for your team, etc. However, you never seem to pay for damages taken to your car, which might irk some who want extreme realism. You also have the option of accepting other teams' offers and driving for them to earn some extra cash. Along the way, you'll gain sponsors, which you can put on your car to gain extra money if you meet the company's requirements for the race (e.g. Get above 2nd, win $4K).  The biggest aspect of the game is, of course, the driving. I'd say it's one of the best handling and realistic driving mechanisms I've played, especially for PC and using a keyboard. The options menu gives you control over how sensitive key presses send your car so that you're not constantly hitting left and right to straighten your car (although you still have to do that sometimes, but not often). The stats of each car accurately correspond to how they handle on the track, and there's a variety of classes and brands to choose from.  One thing I'll say, if you're used to racing Need For Speed, get ready for a rude awakening from the world of realist driving games. You can't just press up and bounce off cars and walls constantly to get a win. If you hit things, your car will take damage, and the way it's shown on the car is very accurate. Take too many hits and you'll start damaging things like the wheels, transmission, etc. If you slam into something too hard, you're out of the race. Braking is very imporant in this game and it'll take a few tries (and wrecks) to get the hang of it, but after you learn, the game is a blast.  So far, multiplayer hasn't worked for me. Perhaps they took it down. Even if they did, though, the single player is enough to keep you extremely entertained and have your heart pounding. The AI is very well programmed, trying to avoid hitting you and taking routes that a normal pro driver would. The tracks are very nice, with some (I'm not sure if all) using real-life tracks. The soundtrack is very good too, although you won't notice it most of the time, as the driving takes most of your focus.  Overall, a very good racing game. There are a few nitpicks I have like how your spotter sometimes says, 'You took some damage, but it's nothing serious.', even though your car can be severely damaged. The graphics can also wear on your computer, so if you have a sub-par graphics setup, then make sure you can run the game first before buying it. They look very good though, even on lower FPS the game looks to run smoothly. Like I said, an adrenaline rush that is worth the money (even moreso if it's on sale).  (Appending this to the review, apparently if you have to reinstall the game on another computer, your campaign data is lost and you'll have to start over. Removing .5 points since I don't know if it's the game's or the producer's fault.)  8/10"
One of the best track based racing games I've played so far. It's the perfect blend of arcade and realistic to allow anyone who is interested in racing games regardless of your skill level to play. It's also very good looking for a game from 2008 with a detailed interior view with working mirrors. Decent selection of cars to collect with a bunch more to get with some modding to get the DLC in the game. The only let down is that the multiplayer is long gone now with only the LAN option available to play. I would recommend anyone that likes or is interested in racing games to pick this great game up. On sales it's usually £2.50 which is a bargain. 9/10
"Graphically this is one of the most realistic car racing simulation games I've ever played aside from Sony's Gran Turismo series. There are lots of disciplines of racing to work with and lots of practice modes to brush up on your skills to become a racing master. My roommate is from Long Beach and when I showed him the Long Beach track on GRID, he remembers all the memories of where he worked and where his former apartment was etc, so if he can remember all these things I say the developers paid close attention to detail when designing these tracks. I use an XBOX 360 Controller to play the game so your experience may differ. If your looking for a racing experience that is different from the rest, try this game for sure. Just be sure to use the practice modes (Race Day) before taking on the story mode."
"GRID is one of the most underrated racing games of all time. I think it gets forgotten because of games like Forza &amp; Gran Tursimo but it has been doing things other series haven't for a very long time.  For starters, GRID is a racing game. Not a rally racing game, or tracks, or street racing. It's a racing game, so you can do just about any kind of auto racing you can think of. Most games limit their races to a specific style, which can be great for getting the best experience, but in GRID's case they were able to add a number of styles without compromising any of them.  There aren't nearly as many cars as we've come to expect from modern racing games, only 45, but because of the various race styles you're forced to use a wide of those cars.   There is a reason for that, though. Codemasters, the creators of GRID and the Dirt series, want the focus of the game to be racing, not driving. Not a bad plan for a racing game.   The only downside to this game I experienced was primarily caused by my expectations for it. I was expecting a game like Need for Speed, but this is a bit more simulation than arcade, although it is very much an arcade style racer. However, early on I anticipated drifting around turns and not sliding into walls. It was a little frustrating at first, but then I gave it enough time(not long) to really get the hang of it.  After that the game was a lot of fun to play. "
You ask me what people should know about this game? This is the best racing of the 21st century
Gas/Turn/Crash/Repeat  10/10
"Even after 8 years from its release,  GRID  still holds the spot as my favorite racing game of all times. Period.  When it first came out, it was a pioneer in many aspects. Into my gaming life, it was the first to introduce realistic localized damage, the risk to completely destroy your car and be forced to retire, and -of course- the replays that will let your rewind and undo your last fatal mistake. You can also hire team mates for your team, and the way the campaign is presented really motivates to finish all events. Sound was superb, and the subtle use of music is something I've yet to see in any other game.  I really appreciate the right balance between simulation and fun. The achieved sense of speed will surely keep you at the edge of the seat as you take every corner knowing that a little mistake can be the end of your race. Provided you play at the right difficult for your skills, you are guaranteed a great and rewarding challenge. Although there is not a much variety in tracks, mastering them is the real deal.  It features, however, a nice assortment of licensed cars, every one of which handles and sounds differently. Cars and races are divided into disciplines, all in road, and including Formula 3000 and Demolition Derby. I suggest to play in  head camera  for added immersion, and the use of a controller or wheel is a must.  Unfortunately, online support has been dropped, but it was a blast back then. I should also point out that the store images are a bit misleading; game doesn't look that colorful since the final release uses a yellowish tint. This can be modded, though, as other aspects of the game.  As a side note; there are a couple of DLC that add a few more cars. Those were originally released for consoles, but you can find a sort of unofficial port from the Mac version  here ."
Racing didn't get any better than this. Ever.
  the second most iconic racing game from Codies after the CMR 2.0
"Oh my...  'GRID', or 'Race Driver: Grid', depending on whether or not you really wanna be formal about all of this, is a racing game developed by Codemasters, and has been released on all platforms that matter (I'm looking at you, Nintendo). Throughout the game, you build up your reputation as a race driver, and are faced with a series of different racing disciplines to prove yourself in: drift, F1, Touring, and many more. All of this leads up to a grand finale in each season: The Le Mans 24 Hour Endurance Race on the infamous Circuit de la Sarthe (the version with winding turns on the straightaway). There's a lot of content to barge your way through, and it'll take you a bit of time to get through everything. It's been a while since this game came out, but...   HOLY ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME STILL LOOKS BADASS   If you take damage, it's full-on damage. Windows will crack, hoods will fly off, fenders  will  be bent, and if you crash horribly, your race is over. Granted, it's still hard-body; you're not gonna get the detail that GTA IV gave you with its soft-body damage model. Still, the way tires can come off, and your car ends up looking like it just got done with a demolition derby (which is a racing discipline in-game, mind~), it's a marvel to behold.  That being said, the game is wonderfully optimized. While I'm running some low-tech equipment, I'm still running everything on mostly high settings. It's wonderful to see the inside of your car and how everything reacts according to what's happening on track. It doesn't sound like much, but it helps with the immersion. It's the little things that count.  The cars handle a bit differently than one might be used to. When given the choice between 'arcade racer' and 'simulation', Codemasters seemed to lean more towards 'arcade'. Some people might be turned off by this, but, in truth, this really,  really  adds on to the fun factor. There's no real penalty to being a ♥♥♥♥ to your fellow racers, which, coming from a jaded ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, feels so ♥♥♥♥ing good. Drifting around corners at 100, just to slam into someone else and ruin someone else's day, is  so  satisfying. While the cars don't act  exactly  like they should, it's not going to take long to get used to their handling, and you'll find yourself knocking races out of the park in just a few goes.  GRID has a few issues, mainly with its AI. But, in truth, AI has always sort of been a problem (I'm looking at you, Bethesda). While the computer isn't as dumb as rocks, it most certainly could use some work. I'm not sure if it's intentional, but it seems as though the AI can be just as aggressive as you on occasion. Most of the time, they're as submissive as a small puppy, but regardless, a few can lash out like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed rotweiller. It's jarring, but it keeps you on your toes, at least.  There's a lot I've missed in this review, but as much as I'd love to go over them, GRID just got done re-downloading, and that takes precident over everything else.  9/10"
"By far one of the best racing games. By no means a simulation, its provided me with hours of fun. Drifting is a blast (although tricky sometimes) and demolition derbies are just glorious carnage. There is enough track diversity that they never get old, but they still feel familiar.   My only complaint is that it can feel like a grind getting podium finishes to rank up/"
"I only just bought Grid 1, 2 and Autosport recently. I've never had a chance to play any of them, but I wish I did! Before playing this, I had about an hour of gameplay on Grid Autosport, but decided I'd get through this game first. Because of the simulation-like racing of Autosport, I was kind of expecting the same from Grid 1. And it is, but some of it crosses more into an arcade racing game.  Grid is fun from the get-go. A nice variety of street racing courses in Japan and USA as well as real world tracks in all countries. The amount of different racing modes also keep the game exciting. When you get bored of a standard race, you can move on to drift racing, derby races and pro touge sprint races. You have your own driving team once you earn up a bit of money, you can have a teammate for races and all of your cars have the same team finish.  It's not by any means a perfect game though. It's almost impossible to race with traction or stability control off, because you'll be constantly spinning. Driving over grass and sand is a lot more of a nightmare than it should be, But if you're a good driver then that shouldn't be a problem. ;) I also get bored of doing the Le Mans race after ever 3-4 tournaments I participate in. The end of race seasons come by pretty quick. However, this is a very fun, arcade-meets-simulation racing game, and I recommend this to anyone who likes to earn millions of dollars in racing games, and also those who are more of an arcade racing fan than simulation. This game might be the perfect balance for you."
10/10 It's okey
One of the best multiplayer racing games. After they shut down the multiplayer servers there still is one of the best single player experiences when it comes to racing. Later Grids do not come even close.
"  Grid is a racing simulation game and is released back in the year of 2007. The game is nice to play and with a racing wheel it feels more realistic. In the game you'll get a lot of fun with the grid world mode, the race day mode and with the sound even more, but only if the multiplayer mode was still online the game was really worth a shot.   When you open the grid world mode, you will begin with a racing match. The match decides your future; which is if you worthy enough to be a racer. You'll get a race licence. When I first played the match, I'd crashed and started the match again. Only my 4th try helped; I finally surpassed the finish line. After this you'll get a cutscene, which you can't skip. After the cutscene you can choose which match you want to play. If you complete these matches you'll get cash. In the race day mode, you can choose which car you want to race with it and also: the location, the routes, how many laps and the livery of the car.  Pros:   - The game is fun to play - The graphics of the game seems okay - The sound of the game is nice - The crashes are well made - The races are nice   Cons:  - The multiplayer mode is offline(there will be standing an error message when you click on it) - Not many variety in customization - No trading cards  The game is nice, but I'd like to recommend you the newest grid series because of the multiplayer mode to play with friends or stranges worldwide. Only if you are a race fan and the game gets discounted for a reasonable price I will recommend you this game.  Received a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.

"//NEW REVIEW// I wrote my old review with about 2 hours of experience with the game. At the time of this writing, I have about 6 hours of experience, and my opinion has completely changed. I love Grid. It feels absolutely thrilling. It's is definitely difficult to learn, but once you start to understand, things change completely. Wow, what a great racing game.  // OLD REVIEW // My experience with Grid: race loads, engines rev, crash at first corner. Reload race. Repeat ad nausem. The game looks great, but it's ferociously difficult. Unlike Forza, there's absolutely no learning curve. Plus the AI is absolutely out to kill you. I really want to like Grid, but it's taking a long, long time to get the hang of it. Also, I find it very frustrating that the keybindings only have ONE possible setting, so if I bind a key to my racing wheel, it no longer works on the keyboard. I learned early on to only use the wheel for driving, and leave all the other buttons on their default bindings. It is a very pretty looking game, though, and you definitely get a feeling of the POWER of the cars you're driving. Mostly this just makes me want to play Forza, though."
One of the finest car game thats old and still holds up to time i recommend this.
"I got GRiD on a sale for a little over a euro and I must say it's worth many times more than that. My PC's current VGA is terrible and yet the game manages to run at 40-50 FPS (albeit on low settings). The racing disciplines and the cars themselves are well-varied and, while not a simulator, you can get a challenge out of it if you turn off the driving aids. Sadly all kind of MP is long dead, so whatever you're doing is gonna be singleplayer-only. Still, there aren't many games out there that give you accessible fun to domains such as open wheel, touring cars, drift, GT and LMP, and certainly even fewer that offer all of that at the same time. Definitely a must!"
"If you're wondering why so many people sing the praises of this game, it is for a good reason: GRiD was the first of its kind to do what it did.  GRiD (Or formely better known as Race Driver: GRiD) is a 2007 simcade racing game developed by Codemasters, and runs on the Ego engine. GRiD places you in the flesh of a new driver, working their way up from contracts with other teams to creating and managing a team of their own, participating in different tournaments and events around the globe.  The 3 continents available in GRiD have very distinct disciplines and styles: The USA focuses on street racing and muscle cars, Europe focuses on Touring, and Japan focuses on Drifting and Tuners.  As well as racing for your own team, you are also able to have your own teammate on the track, who actually relays information back to you as the race goes: Position, time behind/ahead of you, etc...  The graphics of the game, while now beaten by the game's sequels and successors, still holds up on it's own today, and has a beautiful 'sunset' sheen for most of the enviromments you race in.  Overall, GRiD is one of the best racing games I have ever played, and my nomination for the 'Test Of Time' category in the 2016 Steam Awards.   9.5/10. A perfect example of a perfect racing game."
"Possibly the best car racing game I have played! Although the game is not that good without the Mount Haruna Multiplayer MOD (made by the SakaidaBrothers whom you can find on YouTube). That mod makes the game perfect.  The driving is both realistic and fun, which gives a great driving (or drifting, in my case) exeperience.   I am up for a drift battle if you install the MOD ^^"
"Yeah I recommend this game! Why? Well, because it is a great racing game, of the best. Considering that most programmers from the TOCA development team worked on this game, they succeed to create an immersive racing feeling. It may not be a full simulator, but it really sent you on the track. Cockpit view, bro, that's specifically awesome about it. Still having fun online, but using Gameranger.  TL:DR version: Buy the game, is freaking awesome."
Detailed and functional cockpit view 10/10
"This held up well against time. Still as fun as it was when it was released, 8 years ago."
I have played it on xbox 360 and it was so fun which i am sure will be the same for the pc version  Thumbs up
"I've been playing GRID for years because the racing is just really enjoyable--especially with a racing wheel. Whenever I want to jump back into a racing game, I'll play GRID. There is no need to spend time acquiring different parts and tuning them, only to lose a race and have to go back and forth between the Garage and the track to get a setup that works. It's all about the racing and pushing yourself to do better.  There are some nice licensed tracks like Nürburgring, Spa, and Turkey; and there are some great fantasy tracks as well. I like the hilly track in the scenic mountains of Okutama, and Long Beach with it's tight corners is really fun in Formula 3 cars. Shibuya is a lot of fun too--lots of corners on a wet street circuit at night in an electrifying Japanese shopping district (no interruptions from Godzilla and Megaguirus).  You can do the Le Mans 24 Hours in different classes. I think it runs about 15 minutes, but the sun will set and you'll race in the dark for a bit before sunrise.  GRID has a nice roster of cars.The Lamborghini Murcielago is a favorite of mine here. This is the game that made me a fan of using cockpit views, and I wasn't expecting to like them. GRID also innovated a rewind feature called Flashbacks, so you can go back and retry those corners you blew without having to restart the whole race.  I play GRID with a mod that removed the game's yellow tint, and I recommend that. There are other graphics mods as well. The game looks beautiful for me."
"NATHAN MCKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANE  CM's best game to date by far. Yes, it's an arcade racer, so the multiplayer experience suffers because of it, but it more than makes up for that with its impeccable career mode. The progression is fluid and natural, the game (with one VERY notable exception in the form of Le Mans) never gets old and the pacing is just right. It has genuine difficulty, aided by an AI that's WAY ahead of its time.  Ravenwest bring all the flair and excitement that you'd expect from an honorable 'designated #1 enemy' team, and they're hugely hyped all throughout the game. Knowing how other games would treat something like this, you'd normally expect the races against them to be disappointing simply because they wouldn't be able to live up to the hype.  And yet, with some exceptions, CM managed to get it right. Nathan McKane and Rick Scott are fantastic bosses to go up against. The atmospheric value of the Shibuya drift duel with Rick Scott is unfathomably high, while the Viper vs Viper duel with TOCA legend Nathan McKane combines hype, thrill and extreme difficulty into one hell of an exhilarating package.  And then there's the soundtrack. Good lord, the soundtrack.    One of the best racing games of all time. Possibly even one of the outright best games of all time. Nothing short of fantastic even 6 years after its release. Just make sure you remove the ugly yellow filter.  Highly recommend it. A true classic. Play it while you still have the chance."
Classic Grid Game. I like the team managenent in this game compare to the later game.
"-GRID is really good as long as you're looking for a arcade-type racing game. -You can choose the difficulty before every race so if there is a particular type of racing that you're not good at (ex: Drifting) you can set it on easy just for that race.  -The controls are really on point (atleast with a 360 controller) -You will WANT to read the guide about changing the max resolution (very easy) to 1920x1080 because it's locked at 1280 I believe. But once you do that, with the graphics settings all the way up, it still looks really good (2016) -If you're looking for a real simulation game or a game with customizable cars you're in the wrong place. The only customizing you can do in this game is changing your team's car colors a bit."
One of the best racing games i have ever played. The car physiks are amazing. Dont forget to install the grafik mods for this game! With this mods grid looks still awesome after all this years!   With the program 'GameRanger' you can still play GRID online.   Steam Summersale &lt;3
"One of the most fun racing games in my opinion.  + Amazing nice blend of arcade and simulation (with all assists enabled), which is enjoyable but still poses a challenge + Stylish graphics + Wide selection of cars, some of which are really fun to drive (like Honda NSX-R or Audi R10 TDi)  - All the cars in the drift category have way too powerful engines - Sometimes damage to the car persists after going back in time - LMP1 races are imbalanced if you drive any other car than the R10"
"This game, it perfectly blends realism/simulation with arcade type racing. You are always trying your best and end up winning at your best. The AI is very competetive (not braindead like some other racers), and even at Basic difficulty it puts up a challenge, but a fair one. I've been playing on 'Serious' thus far, and it is really enjoyable. Every race, on every map/track, heart is pounding, hands are cold, eyes dry from not blinking,... then *sigh*, you cross the line, everybody on the radio cheers, you get paid, and you go home.  Gameplay gets tiring after 10-12 races in a row, especially if you go trough Le Mans, twice. But in the end, a roaring V8, or a revvy inline 4, manual transmission, no-mater-what-wheel-drive, cockpit view,... fun for hours. Also, everyone likes to drive without traction control, abs, whatever. This game, don't. If you have superhuman reflexes and a full racing cockpit connected to your PC, go ahead, otherwise don't, it's just way more fun if the car goes in a straight line and turn when you want it to without smashing like a meteor down the road into the barrier.  Game is very optimized, runs pretty quick even on a potato. The HDR is a bit intense sometimes, but amazing to look at even on low res. This is definitely one of my favorite racing games of all time.  Needs a bit of tweaking in order to get it running with a keyboard properly.  Also the flashback system, genius, just saves hours. "
Classic Grid Game. I like the team managenent in this game compare to the later game.
The drifting mode alone was enough to keep me playing for almost 24 hours! Its a blast with friends and the campaign is incredibly fun too!!!  
"Good game: - Controls feel responsive and realistic - There's a big selection of cars, events and tracks - Graphics still hold up pretty well for a 2008 game - Music is alright, sometimes used to add tension or excitement - Career mode is enjoyable, it's nice to watch your team and reputation grow  Personally I found 'normal' difficulty a bit too easy, but I really can't think of any other gripes. This is a good, solid game which I got for around £2 in a sale - an absolute steal. Definitely worth a buy, even at 'full price' (which has been reduced anyway due to the game's age).  Note: listen to eurobeat while playing for improved performance."
To arcady for my taste. But that is what makes me recommend it if you are looking for a semi to less serious arcade racer. Plus it has a few fun features to fool you into thinking its a real racing game (simulation). Fun title!
"This game may be 8 years old but oh boy is it still a great game and if you're wondering whether to get it, now is the best time as it is 3 dollars and it's an all time classic! 10/10 IGN"
"After going through GRID, GRID2 and GRID: Autosport (just a few hours) it's time to write some review about them, lets start with this one.  So I'm absolutely going to rate 10/10 for this game, it's the best racing game I've ever played. Codmasters made a good balance between a racing simulator and a normal arcade driving game. It's easy to get start with like the NFS franchise, but a little more difficult than that because you'd find out that driving flat out will ruin your car. And by this way, it makes you to race with skills. You'll learn to brake before corners, you'll learn to drive in efficient racing lines, you'll learn to avoid contact with your competitors to matain the performance of your car. This is a game where you'll achieve your dream of being a pro race driver. By the way NFS makes it possible for you to drive fancy cars, go outlaws and feel good, it's great too.  Another thing to make you feel like a pro was the 24h Le Mans. They compact the real time 24h into 12min in the career mode, and made a day and night shift for it, which looked so great. Besides this compact version of 24h you can choose for 24min to even real time 24h in race day mode. And you can test drive any of your car. Just driving in Nürburgring, trying to go a perfect run and improving the lap time is a great fun for me.  GRID has the best cockpit view out of the two. Why two? Because GRID2 doesn't have a cockpit view, I'd leave that to the review of GRID2. So there were so many datails in the cockpit, and it's live, the dashboard and the gear changing signal are really doing what they should be doing. It feels just like drving in a real race car. And the damage had a lot of details too, the damges are taken by parts. Steering, suspension and so on, and the lead to different problem in your driving.  And actually there are downsides in this game. Your team mate was acting like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. If it drives badly it'll be staying in the back of the pack through out the race and get your team beaten by Ravenwest. But if he's driving great, like Tom Rockford (the best I found in the game) you may find, he'll bump you, block you and spin you out. Maybe codemasters thought those bots were driving ♥♥♥♥ so they sent you a 'team mate' to disturb you and make things more challenging. Yeah, by spinning me out and pull me straight from the 1st place down to the last but one (crashed) in the last one minute of Le Mans. I should have fired him.  Your team mate was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but wait, there's a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the track. Every first corner of the track, if you're the last of the pack, trust me, that takes more than skills to get out of there in one piece. And after the first corner, you still got ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to pass on the way. They care nothing about your lines. For example if you go parallel with one car through the corner and you're the inside one and inccidently you're on his line, he 'll definitely crash on you to get on his line. Two results for this, you spin out and he goes out, or the two cars stick together and disabling the turning of each other then head for the wall. I can remember in one race, going clockwise in Okutama, GRID position in 7th, and the first corner made me freak out.  But this game is still great, for a race drving gamer or for those who want to change a flavor from arcade drving game to a race simulator. And it's not expensive, really worth buying."
"The game was true fun... until I get to the 3rd level of events. The amount of obvious rubberbanding went incredible, you can cut all the corners just perfectly, make a lot of clean overtakes - but it is all pointless cause as soon as you get to the final lap you can expect podium competitors catch you up with the speed of the millenium falcon. I understand this way of making the game more challenging, but when with every next race it becomes more and more the main (or only) part of AI skill, the game simply becomes a piece of annoying arcade turd, forcing you into bashing, smashing and redoing the same stage on and on till you are sick.  Honestly I just rage-quited after a few tries of getting through Ravenwest lead during Prototype Championship in J-Speed Super One. But enough is enough, I am simply tired of starting all the time in the last place (what the heck is the method of placing the starting position? Is it simply random?), forced to bypass a bunch of f***ing idiots (the biggest one being your teammate, I mean WTF man, are we for sure in the same team?!) bashing into each other or in the rear of your car. When you are done with them rookies, no matter how good you are it is hardly possible to keep your nerves together when all you can see are Ravenwest taking corners with ridiculous speed without even breaking… ♥♥♥♥ it! Try to do that exactly the same way – yeah, now you can rewind…  Other big issue is that game simply gets boring in the half of the way of the ‘Grid World’. I really enjoyed touges, D-Derby were just amazing and Pro-Types were incredible. But the second half of the game is mostly all about endurance (which is more a fight with your understeering car than taking care of competitors) or drift (where AI completly sucks and you nail the scoreboard with your eyes closed). I do not want to dwell on the pros of this game, because there is as many of them as cons – and cons are the part that should be noticed – for getting rid of them in the future (yeah, we already had GRID 2 and Autosport so maybe it is too late to say this) and thus making them better.  Well, there is one special positive thing about entire series - each car has its own unique ‘soul’ making driving them a lot of fun – hard to say it feels like real but for sure you can feel the power and heaviness of muscle car. And that is the thing that will make me finish the game. Even if I am temporarily annoyed by it."
"This is an amazing game. Great cars, tracks etc. One of the best racing games out there I've seen. The career can be rough, but it's nothing too hard after a while. Really recommend it to anyone who likes games like Need for Speed."
"Great game. If you enjoy a racing simulation this will keep you entertained for hous on end. Driving is simple and very easy and quite honestly the games heaps of fun. Maybe it's just me but my favorite part are the midnight touges intense fun and much like fast and furious tokyo drift. i think the drifting on the game has a bit of a learning curve to it but it's not that bad but that might just be me. Buy the game, you wouldn't regret it."
"D4LE'S EXPERIENCE: RACE DRIVER: GRID   Let me tell you a story if you don't mind because this is pretty much sums up my childhood and my reason why did I bought this game on Steam.  *F L A S H B A C K S* I was a big fan of the Toca racing games. I owned Toca world touring cars for the ps1, Toca racing driver, Toca racing driver 2 and also the 3rd one, all which are for the PS2. Jump to 2007 where I got the Xbox 360, I heard Toca racing driver is back but this time they changed the name to 'Race driver Grid'. Me and my dad went to a gaming store to buy the game and when I got home, I quickly went to my room, turn on my Xbox, put the disc in and play it. Aaaannnd, I barely touch it because my 7 years old brain told me 'it was too complicated'. I didn't touched the game until late 2015 (THAT LONG BOYS N GIRLS) and the disc was full with scratches. In other words, Rip in Porsches.  Hop to 2016 where I was messing around playing a game with my friend and he told me he wanted to play GRID. I was a bit shocked and asked him 'Wait, u can play grid on steam?' and he replied with 1 word 'Yes.' I quit the game and checked to the store and to my surprise, the game had 80% discount. I bought the game, download it and play it for quite awhile. This is my experience and my opinion on Race Driver Grid. * END OF F L A S H B A C K S*  First of all, I was surprised that my PC can run this game smoothly. My PC is categorized as a potato and it runs like in the Xbox with slightly better graphics. And if you're saying 'Well d4le, this game is made in 2007. How come u find it surprising?' There are games made in that year where my potato is screaming for help and in this case, it wasn't screaming. Though there were times where the fps is dropping, I don't really mind because it's not really major. Speaking about the graphics, this game has some pretty nice graphics &amp; visuals. At the time which I believe was the competitor for Forza, I liked this more because the color and you can see how well detailed if you had an accident on a corner or you rammed a car on purpose like when my brain was 7 years old.  Second, I fell in love with the gameplay. Yes, I do know this game can be frustrating and I know this game isn't really realistic (I see it as half arcade and half sim tbh), but when you get the hang of it, you feel this big sense of accomplishment like 'YOU DID IT SON. I'M PROUD OF YOU'. There was this one moment when I used an old mustang against a Honda NSX in a Touge race. The level was extreme and It was painfully hard but after couple of restarts and start to realize my mistakes, I did it. I felt like I was the king of the world and I literally screamed to my monitor saying 'HAAHAHAH LOOK AT ME NOW, BOYS. I'M THE CHAMP'. In short, I had a lot of fun with the gameplay and with all my seriousness, I can't wait playing it again.   Third, the cars and the track selection are awesome. There's actually a DLC for this game which I'm not mistaken, they added a Bugatti veyron and other cars and also other tracks that I might have forgotten, but even if you don't have money to buy it, it doesn't really matter. The thing I remembered is the San Francisco track and I also remembered every time I race against a Mustang GTR, he always fail at the corner before the last chicane. Even if I race or drift alone in that track, I will still remember it as the Mustang corner.    However, there are things sadly I have to nitpick.  Probably the only thing that is quite bothering me is the controls and physics. Every car controls differently which is great and understandable. But oh my lord, the default force feedback is so awful. If you don't know what I did, I spent just around the first 15 minutes of the game just to tune the force feedback (if you want to know what I truly did, I just put 10% more on it except the strength) and after that, it made the game like how I wanted to. Don't get me wrong though, I like the EGO engine and I enjoyed the first DiRT because it's a good mixture between arcade and simulation, but in some aspects there are parts where the car gets too twitchy to the point of frustration. On my right brain, I see it as a challenge. However with my left brain, I see it as the other way around. If you want to know how I see it as a challenge and just plain throwing cuss words, welcome to my love/hate relationship with this game.  Now this is where it's located somewhere in between because I like it and I don't really like it for some reasons and so far, it's only these two. Imo, Endurance and drift events are the love/hate relationship in GRID. Let's start with the endurance races. I love how they interpreted the 24 heures le mans and the day/night cycle is amazing.  However, it will becoming a some sort of an annoyance because the game starts to offer endurance races everytime in the end of the season but you can actually reject it if you don't want to. I mean, ya it's cool to get more de_moni but let me ask you this: are you gonna spend 24 minutes not including you complaining bout the AI crashing your sanity harder than Miley Cyrus's mixtape and the never ending restarts just to get a new set of wheels? It's a tough decision  Alright, the drift events are the true meaning of what I meant about the love/hate relationship. First of all, the cars that were designed for drifting looks outstanding. I mean, look at that s15, the supra and the rx7, and the.. 06 Pontiac GTO? Why yes. Oh and look at the tire smokes! It looks gorgeous at the time.  But my issue with the drift events are located on my nitpicks. First off, turning off the traction control is like removing your life vests while you're stranded somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. Sure, you will look like an olympics athlete, but it takes some man out of you to get to your destination. However, turning on traction control is like the opposite of what I've said earlier. Your legs won't be bitten by jaws, your hands aren't going to be chopped by barracudas, your eyes won't be looking down for sunfishes (serious tho, those things are scary as hell), but where's the fun in that?  In short, I love the challenge turning down the TC, but you're probably gonna need a lot of time just to drift around a track. If you turning on TC, you will get the event down in no time, but no challenge. Again, it's a tough decision whether you will go for it or not.  In conclusion and even though the controls are a bit weird, this game is still an awesome racing game and I will recommend it for ones who adore racing games in general."
"The game just pits you in certain tracks without letting you test it. And most of the time you are placed far back, and you have to overcome 10+ cars in a matter of 2 laps. This then requires you to drive aggresively, often times hitting other cars just to get ahead of them. But this leads us to another problem - you spin out of control easily. Even if a slow ♥♥♥ car hits you while you're turning at the corner, you spin out and and half the time it's impossible to recover. The AI is horrible as well. I think the game really wants you to lose. The cars in the middle (4th-10th place) drive like ♥♥♥♥ and the top 3 cars usually drive amazingly. Since you're also put somewhere near the back the ♥♥♥♥ drivers slow you down, and they hit you almost all the time. This causes the better drivers (1st to 3rd) to pull away while the ♥♥♥♥ cars drag you to hell.   The grip is inconsistent as well. It seems as though the opponents have much more grip than you. I can feel the car's understeer when I push it to it's limits, but the AI car (supposedly in the same car) can just blast and accelerate through the apex. I've also seen that the AI cars don't slide, even when they're suppsoed to. In short, AI drivers have NFS physics while you have the GRID one. There is also a track (Milan or Washington, can't remember) that seemingly has inconsistent ground. Once you get past the bridge, it becomes incredibly slidey. You'd have to brake early in order not to slide while enemies can just go through it normally.  But there are some good parts. After you get past the first few races the game begins to get fun. You unlock more cars and teammates as you make your way to the top. There's also a Global license after the Pro license (USA,EU,Japan). The racers here are noticably better and more competitive than the lower ranked racers. The Head 2 Head battles with Ravenwest are also great. Intense downhill battles and circuit racing with muscle cars wherein a small mistake could cost you the race.  There are also several race types like drift and Le Mans. This game has hands down one of the best and coolest drifting mechanics. With a controller, you can actually feel the throttle and how much you need to push the car just to get it to turn. Le Mans races are quite long but satisfying.  This game also has an amazing finale. 1 v 1 , your crew vs Ravenwest on the Circuit de la Sarthe. NPC difficulty set to EXTREME and only 1 flashback. It's an incredibly long race (possibly 10+ minutes) and the enemy is always on your back. A small mistake, like missing the braking point, can make you lose.  7.5/10"
This is the perfect game if you like racing. But it has great graphics but be warned if you dont have a powerful computer the game wont run
I call Codemaster RACINGmaster
"The best GRID game out of all 3 of them, brings back a lot of memories."
"One of the best racing games I know of. However, you need a software virtual private network to play the multiplayer now, given that the official support for it is gone. No bigge, download Tunngle and you're set. Great fun among friends!"
"What an awesome game! first i looked at the negative comments and thought, should i buy this game? but i just did it and it it defenitly worth your money. everything is just perfect made the handeling it is just perfect and there is so much realism in this game. Its not like need for speed were you can drive like an idiot. I have know only 2 hours played but in the future its going to be a lot more! So dont look further for another race game beacause this is it! I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE this game. Finally i got a cheap race geam for worth is money!!  Ps: Play this game with a XboX Controller 100% wurf"
"Before buying this game, please note the multiplayer servers have been turned off. That said, the single-player game is still very substantial and enjoyable. All Codemasters racing games are of high quality and this was the first one I experienced.  I found the game was stable, looked great, had good scalable difficulty and had responsive controls. I think this was the first game to introduce the use of 'flashbacks' too which is good for people who feel the urge to restart the race every time they do one little thing wrong.  Works great with an xbox pad and I would *not* recommend playing the game with just a keyboard.  The game doesn't go far enough in the realism department to be called a simulation but for most that is probably a good thing. Overall a fun circuit racing game you can pick up on the cheap."
"One of the best racing games is on sale for 80% off!  I love booting GRID up once in a while for a quick race. Tons of cars to choose from, handful of different tracks.. and it has a replay system just like DiRT. If you took a turn too wide, drove too fast, or couldn't avoid a collision ahead of time you can rewind time and replay that portion again."

"This is quite an amazing game, yet I didn't know about it until a year ago. It feels like Codemasters took ToCA and made it so it appeals to the casual gamer (which is what they essentially did). The game has a wide variety of different cars ranging from a little, underpowered japanese hatchback turned into a tire slayer to a top-of-the-class LMP1 bolide designed in a special facility. You get to form and manage your very own racing team, recruit team members, have sponsorships and design team liveries. The driving physics are fun and easy to adapt to. The game doesn't punish you if you don't win every single race. Sponsorship objectives add more variety and challange to the races.  I bought this game from a code marketplace for cheaper than a Happy Meal, and after an hour into the game I felt like I robbed the people over at Codemasters because this game is just so fun.  9/10  Highly reccomend it."

"Its older, the graphics are a little greyscaled and gritty yet still I come back to this game every now and then for a quick blast.  Custom team names, custom car paint jobs and a custom call sign? These are brilliant features I've barely seen anywhere!  The racing? Fast and (at times) chaotic. In short its a cheap game now well worth the price and very much standing the test of time."
I like how you can't undo the races.
"From a greenhorn's standpoint, I give this racing game a solid two thumbs up.  It's arcade-ish enough to throw a ton of fast paced fun in your face, but still presents a challenge for those that don't want a gimme. Just in the early stages of the game, but it seems that the AI competition is no slouch when it comes to bumping and grinding. Courses are authentic and challenging; take too much damage, and you're out of the race, which adds a nice (if small) bit of realism to the game.  Xbox controller seems to work fairly well with the game.  Stunning graphics, great sound. Gameplay feels responsive, not clunky at all. Lovin' Grid so far! :)  If you're looking for a hardcore challenge/simulation, maybe 'steer' clear of this game. If you're just looking for some fast paced racing action, I'd say the regular price of the game is worth it for sure.  10/10"
"Listen, the game's great. That's all you really need to know. It's a bit arcade-y, and that threw me off a bit when I realized you can fly through most corners without braking, but whatever. It's a lot of fun, and the damage model beats most games.  So if you do get this game, make sure to install BroSki's mod to remove the ugly yellow tint. Once you do this, the game looks like amazing, like GTA IV with ENB, or maybe Assetto Corsa. Also the performance is great - if you have a modern graphics card you can max it out - my GTX 970 can DSR from 4K + ultra @ 60FPS  EDIT: the more I play this game, the more I'm annoyed by its flaws. For example, the AI needs work: the first corner of every race is always a pile-up, they take very strange racing lines which result in them pit maneuvering you, and they constantly push against you which renders steering impossible.  Also, for some reason most of the tracks have props in terribly unsafe places - tokyo docks involves so much dodging of boxes, shipping crates and forklifts.   The worst part about these props is that they tend to get stuck under the front of your car, either jacking the front end up and therefore losing steering or sending your car barrel rolling down the track.  But hey, I still recommend it."
"First I will say that I don't really like racing games. They all feel the same - that boring driving a car feeling. This game isn't that. Sure its a standard racing game but they do it well. You get to race in 3 different regions, USA, EU, and Japan. USA races are rush through the skyscrapers in your muscle cars smashing and bashing through the tight turns where as European races are the long open wheel cars that bumping someone can crash both of you and everyone behind you and finally Japan loves its drifting competitions and crazy drifting required race tracks.  (Japan gives me the most trouble as I don't understand the drifting in the game and that is probably my biggest complaint)  Also in the main game every 'year' you race a 24 hour race (24 mins in game) its intense and it really shows you how much you have yet to learn or how much you have learned about the racing mechanics. When you get first it really feels great because you just played one race without crashing for almost a half hour and won. The downside is its terribly hard and frustrating. Ive raged a small bit at that race although it is skippable probably for that reason.   Overall if you are looking at the game its worth the buy but there is a sequel. I personally have not played Grid 2 (I do own it though) but Grid is a solid game that is worth a try."
still the best racing game.
I love racing!!!
You can still play this game online with Gameranger
"Old but beautiful, limited amout of cars, but the gameplay is so good.  Grid &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Grid 2"
"Race Driver: GRID is quite likely the last wholly enjoyable experience offered by a Codemasters title on PC. There's not really anything bad to say about it. Cars handle nicely, there's a fun variety of events (Drift and Togue in particular have eaten up a lot of my time), and the head-to-head battles with other Racing teams have some surprisingly excellent music. It plays well, sounds great, and looks very pretty. Highly recommended to just about anyone."

"The best racing game you'll ever come across.   This game beats all the Forzas, Need For Speeds, Gran Turismos, etc.  The mechanics of this game are phenomenal, top quality graphics and many cars, tracks, tournaments, races to do!  If you can't afford the newer GRID games, definitely go for this one, it'll not let you down!!  10/10"
"Cool game, semi-realistic-semi-arcadish racing game...  I have over 50 screenshots on my profile if you want to decide via screenshots if you like the look of the game... Also, looking for someone to compete with my World Records- included in the screenshots, Message me if you're intrested in beating me ! :D  I am competitive, good luck with driving and have fun!  My review score : 7.5/10, reasons... : Codemasters has shutdown multiplayer so the only competitivnes there is versus AI and World Record leaderboards...  If multiplayer comes back its going to be 8.5/10 :D"
"+Good blend of realism and arcade mechanics. Appeals to a large Crowd + Instant Replays +Damage depends on angle, g forces, etc +Enemy AI is varied: none of that tailgating BS seen in GT5/GT6 +Teamates +Decent variety of events and maps + Got this game in a package deal, was like $2.50 each +Quite a few options for racing wheels/console controllers +dat action  -Not Enough Cars -Some cars arent balanced. Ex: Murcielago has a tighter turnign radius than Saleen S7 -Slow-mo glitch seen in The Crew -Engineer dialogue is always behind -Multiplayer is dead -I know Le mans is an annual event, but do I really want to do that every couple of hours? Luckily, I can skip it (miss out on big loot tho) -ZERO tuning/customization -Handbraking in a straight line - this might be me just being nitcpicky, but I like having a variable amount of Traction Control; I usually have it set to 30% on Gran Turismo, but this game only has on/off  Overall 6.5/10"
Nothing will prepare you for the final minute of Le Mans. 1337/10 would epic hype music again.
3rd place simulator :D  'looks like Ravenwest is in this one'  well ♥♥♥♥ 3rd is fine I guess 
"I was never a huge driving game fan, but this game is a ton of fun. The tracks/cars and gameplay are all fresh and worth putting at least some time into. Actually has a decent and fun drift mode."
"A racer with a really nice balance between arcade and realism, and quite a large variety of motorsports; open-wheel formula racing, Tōge, drifting, even a demolition derby and a (truncated) version of 24 Hours of Le Mans.  Still one of the best racing games released in the past 5 years or so."

awesome racing game!! it has so many different events. my favorite was the japanese mountain races. it really kept the initial D style to it. i still play it all these years later. i wish they would hurry up and make part 2 instead of making all the dirt games..
"First of all : This one is the best of its kind . I never saw a better racing simulator on a PC  *Awesome Physics *Nice Cars *Cool Graphics *1-20 cars on one track *Real Challenge!  You need to know how to drift on that game, it is not that hard to learn it, but there actually is some challenge, so you'd better be ready for it :3  If you are a fan of Racing games and Simulators - You should get that game"
"Great fast action, mix of sim and arcade. Hope you have a good video card.... "
Great game!
Probably the best racing experience that is given to the player. Corkpit mode with manual makes it feels just real.
Very awsome racing game! Suggest!
"All round a good racing game, only issue is now all the cars are outdated"
Quality Game. Great Purchase. No regrets other than waiting as long as i did. Multi-player wouldve been awesome.
Best racing game since GranTurismo
It has the  AE86  and a variety of doriftu modes. What more could you need?  Online servers were shut down a long time ago but the game supports LAN meaning you can use  VPN solutions  [www.tunngle.net] .  Be sure to blast  eurobeats  for the ultimate experience.
"This game is great! If you're a fan of racing games then this is a must-have. There's lots of content, the graphics are nice, the gameplay is really good and it runs fairly well on low-medium end PCs, like mine. While the flashback system isn't as good when compared to GRID 2, it's still very functional and a very nice feature to have for when you stuff up right before the finish line. Get this game!"
"Whilst the online multiplayer side of things is no longer officially supported (there are workarounds), the single player is a fun 'Arcade' racer. Just about playable on a keyboard but a Joypad or a Wheel is a must.   A Steal at the Midweek Madness price!"
"Want a drifting and a fun racing game, no need to look any further. This one has it all. It even better than it s sequel GRID2, and it has a pretty decent inside view."
This is by far one of the best racing games I've played in a long time. This games almost 5 years old and everything about it is so ahead of its time.
GRID is better game then its successor (Grid 2 is more like NFS) good game with bad replays and no car settings.  7.5/10
"Epic. Most accurate car sim in a while, works best with the wheel."
"I purchased this game in a weekend offer -75%, I bought it after F1 2013 in order to have some GT type car racing game. I would say that it is too arcade for my taste compared to F1 2013, I don't like the career mode in wich you have to earn money, create a team, etc... There is a modality of single seater car, RR or formula 3000 I don't remember, don't even bother to try it, the phisics is very unrealistic. In the other hand, the night road competitions in japan are quite interesting, also GT or touring cars in regular circuits: nurbungring, SPA... The possibility of disconecting ABS and TC is one of the most remarcable benefits of this game. After purchasing GTR2 I found what I was looking for (GT race simulator) so I stopped playing GRID. Anyway, it's not a bad deal for 3,5€ if don't mind some arcade stuff.  Pros: Can be found for reasonable price, I bougth it for 3,50€ Possibility of disconecting driving aids (ABS, TC), not anymore in GRID 2 Graphics are good to be a 2008 game, smoke, sunsets, etc. Good variety of circuits Damage simulation, not only visual The driving feels powerfull  Conts: Arcade, cars wait for you if you are slow American stuff, muscle cars, and some annoying comments like in Dirt 2 No tire degradation or fuel consumption"
"tl;dr version: why haven't you bought this already, one of the best racing games of the past decade  did read version: I'm a bit of a racing game nut, both sim and arcade, console and PC, and I have to tell you, I've not played a racing game that is as much  fun  as this in a very, very long time. The gameplay itself is excellent; the career mode has a good blend of events and you never feel like you're grinding for cash or XP to move onto the next series (well, except for the season-end Le Mans race, which gets old FAST - it's the only unentertaining part of the game, but it can be skipped). There's a healthy selection of cars, and the ability to create your own team is quite a fun feeling, especially when you get to hire your own teammate. There's a medium size track roster, but there's enough between the original courses and the real-life replicas to allow enough variation to keep it from feeling repetitive. There's also a GREAT mixture of race modes from the super-intense LMP and open wheel races to the tuner-oriented street car challenges, and this is one of the only games I know of (except for NFS: Carbon) that has a touge mode, which is wicked fun.   The physics are a pleasant blend of arcade and sim, with the knob a bit more to the arcade side, but it's still very challenging to play if you drive with the assists off and the AI turned up - and that brings me to the crowning jewel of this game, which is the AI. They drive more realistically than I've ever seen in any racing game, putting Gran Turismo and NFS AI to shame. Different drivers will all behave differently, and they can be bloody impossible to pass and catch up to, but not because of rubberbanding or their car's performance specs - they drive the same cars you drive, just sometimes much more skillfully. This culminates in the epic Ravenwest boss races where you 1v1 battle the top drivers in the game, making for some of the most memorable races a game has ever given me.   For the price, you really can't beat this in the racing game genre, and it'll play well with a controller or a wheel. Cannot recommend this enough."
Probably my favourite racing game of all time. I've only clocked about 5 hours upon writing this although I did own it on the Xbox 360 where it was effectively 'mastered'. The handling takes about 5 or so races to get used to and a controller is most definately required in my opinion due to said handling.  Would crash over and over and over again. 10/10.
an awesome driving game love it
"Some people moan about this game and its bad steering sensitivity. However from the start of the game people notice that it is rather slow. All you need to do is just notch the resolution down a bit. Then you can still keep features like the animated 3-D crowd and the amazing crash engine. You may have to compromise on no motion blur, no shadows, lower texture ect, but it is a fantastic game. WORTH the purchase if you ask me."
I Played This Game...AND ITS AWESOME!
Very good game. Recomendation! ;) Good choise.
Holds up amazingly well both visually and gameplay wise. It also runs great on windows 10 and works perfectly with an Xbox One pad.  Here is my full in-depth review         YouTube™ Video:  Grid PC Review&nbsp;
"Amazing looking &amp; playing game. Runs @ 1080p 60fps in full settings with 50% usage on my 7850. Almost F1 like racing on some tracks, where the break button get as much use as the accelerator. Using an Xbox controller."
One of the best racing games I have ever played. :)
I REALY hope they will make it online again   i'd love to drift with some one
The main reason I keep this game is that you can race Le Mans for 24 real hours !
"Excellent driving. Great do-over mechanic. Good amount of content. One of my favorite, no, my favorite racing game of all time. Had it on the PS3 before I came to my senses and joined the PC master race (huehue race, get it? I'm sorry). So many times where I've been waddling in my seat trying to win a race thanks to the soundtrack.  The soundtrack is ♥♥♥♥ing amaze balls. Like seriously, it sounds like I'm racing for my life.  9/10, mainly because the online is closed. If the online was still enabled, then 10/10. Must buy."
"Pro: Fun game with different cars. Challenging but love the crowd cheering. It takes a few times to get used to and even then, unless you're a pro or have the right equipment, you'll still finish last and crash a few times. But I definately see this as doable to get better. It'll just take awhile (unless you're an experienced racer) to get 3rd place or higher. Used a true xbox pc controller and worked great. Though a G27 is on my wish list, I wonder if it would make driving in this game easier and more fun. Realistic in the sense of when you crash into a wall, it tears up your car. And it's very possible to total your car to the point where you can't finish the track.  Con: Not for the absolute beginner.  Lots of curves, for better or worse. No casual play. No solo mode.  No training.  No practice runs. (Ok, I'm being redundant at this point.) Would wish it would be more forgiving on crashes and not tear up your car so much. But then I'm complaining because though I have a handful of racing games, I generally love them but I still suck. lol  I'd still recommend this game as it's one of the better racing games out there.  I bought this during the summer steam sale and glad I did. I think for many the normal $14.99 price is worth it for many as it's better than more expensive games out there. But for me the cheaper sale price was more realistic for my level of experience and skill.  If you are looking for similiar games but with a different flavor: Though more expensive, I would recommend Dirt 3 Complete Edition. It has so many options (cars, tracks, experience levels) and is a blast for an absolute beginner to the experienced. And less frustrating. Another good racing game that offer a different but varies skill levels are Riptide GP2 and Riff Racer (Drive Any Track). The only thing with Riff Racer is that it's solo with no AI. But it builds tracks on music you choose so I like it.  Finally, buy this game. You could pay more for other games but overall this game is worth the normal price for most."
"Strangely enough, I never got time to play the original Grid game: Played a bit of Grid 2 and although it was good I thought it was boring and the cars felt a little artificial maybe?   Grid was on sale and I decided to finally pick it up after thinking about it for many years (where I pushed away the thought of getting it when I did try Grid 2)   First and foremost, Grid is fun. With the first race I get caught by the extreme adrenaline that the game had and I was hooked at once. The game also looks very good and runs well on my GTX 660 without frame drops, constant 60 fps and maybe more? The idea of ​​the game is 6 years old I have to give it a lot of praise for how good it looks, holds up even to today's standards in the graphics.   The control of the cars are also not that hard, it's fun for the begginers in racing genres and the more experienced players with steering wheel etc such as G27 (like me) the same time, the game offer many challenges for those who want it.   Although I've only played nearly two hours, I can definitely recommend it, and for 3,24 Euro per date, it should be illegal to resist this offer.   Have fun;)   9/10"
"After 70 or so hours of playing this game, I'm fairly confident I can write a decent review.  The game sets you off on a great start in one of the greatest cars in the modern American Muscle Car history, the Dodge Viper. The game starts almost immideatly, there is no pesky tutorial that takes out 30 minutes of your time. The game works fairly reastically. It's on the line between simulator and arcade racer, leaning more to the arcade side. I think, however, if you're a casual, you will enjoy it too, as did I when I first begun playing it in late 2011.  However, every Codies game comes with some flaws; sometimes you might get stuck in a wall and clip inside it, but the biggest problem with this game is how clunky the game is without a controller. Until I got my controller about 40 hours of playtime in, I wasn't enjoying myself fully. It's fairly evident that the game was designed to be used with a controller, but a wheel can also be used, despite the aforementioned arcade label.  If you are looking for at least 40 hours of enjoyement with the good leveling system, this is the game for you. The fact the controls without a gamepad are clunky is far from outweighing the realism of this game."
Best PC racer so far.
"brilliant game, love the progression, but never been any good with the 24hr race :("
"Brings back the memories. Old but good old fun,fun,fun"
Realist racing game ive played on a car level aspect nice sound gears

"It's a good game, until you reach the faster cars on a keyboard as it's quite sensitive in terms of controls, but overall it's a great game.  *Update* I have now accuired a controller and the game is 10X better. I would reccomend to anyone who is a fan of most racing sims. The only things that I dislike is that in a few of the races Ravenwest have overly fast cars for the class of car, and that I can't get the hang of the drift events, but other than that it is a brilliant game 8/10"
Quality Game. Great Purchase. No regrets other than waiting as long as i did. Multi-player wouldve been awesome.

Multiplayer has since been shut down so you now cannot play online, unless you can LAN then that's a different story... Otherwise it's a single player racing game.   Graphics: The graphics are pretty decent offering some really good visuals for a racing game which makes you get really into the game.   Audio: Car sounds with tyres screeching along the Tarmac, what else do you need... Only missing smell...  Controls: With a controller the game is a lot easier so I cannot say about keyboard. Found it super easy to control the cars with an Xbox 360 controller   Game: I did not pay attention to the campaign or anything like that, I played online when it was up and running where it was so much fun.  The campaign you are a young racer trying to climb the ranks, that's all I remember but it was nothing special but the game itself is a good racer.   Yes I would recommend."
"It's a good game, until you reach the faster cars on a keyboard as it's quite sensitive in terms of controls, but overall it's a great game.  *Update* I have now accuired a controller and the game is 10X better. I would reccomend to anyone who is a fan of most racing sims. The only things that I dislike is that in a few of the races Ravenwest have overly fast cars for the class of car, and that I can't get the hang of the drift events, but other than that it is a brilliant game 8/10"
"Easily the best arcade racing game I have ever played on PC except the good old NFS titles. This was the game that was considered an NFS slayer back in 2007-2008, when NFS franchise was already going downwards. I spent well over 300 hours into it when I did not yet have a Steam account. This game had the best graphics, and still looks really promising even today. The damage model is simply mindblowing, that I spent maybe half the time just crashing into thiings. The drift mode is one of the best you can find on all racing games, with authentic (not necessarily realistic but you get the feeling) handling physics. There is really no reason why you refuse to get this game and beat it. It does have its own drawbacks, most of which is the feeling of weightlessness of cars, and the non-linear steering which makes using a wheel a bit frustrating. However, none of the drawbacks is enough of pulling the game down, to be honest."
A really good driving game. Totally recommended if you wanna have fun driving cars. The only disadvantage is that the online is down.
"If you like racing games without the hardcore simulation of the more serious ones like GTR, then GRID is a perfect choice."
One of the best racing games I've played! And I only got it for 3 euros (on sale)! I usually dont like race games but this one is just awesome!!
The only GRID worth buying. IMO. Perfect Physics.Truely heart-racing adrenaline.
"Basically you drive cars, make money, get yelled at by a guy, and win life."
"Old but gold. Absolutely amazing, truely amazing mix of arcade and simulation racing. Great physics, great graphics for its age. For its price, definitely more worth it than the new NFS games. 10/10"
Hello! I wanted to say that this is one of the best driving games ever made! Controls at the start are very clumsy.But you can get over it! I recommend this game For racing lovers!
"Bloody hell this game was a rush, if a bit painful at times. Still worth it though. A much better choice over the available Need For Speed options available on Steam.  +The vehicles have decent arcade-styled handling. So you can get very aggressive with turns. +The graphics are still sharp 7 years later. +The AI is brutal and relentless. +Performs well on older rigs.  -The music got boring pretty quickly. Fairly generic choices. -The higher difficulties seem to get a speed boost, so the game encourages to 'do well enough' as opposed to actually win."
"GREAT GAME! I bought this game when it was on sale and got it for half its price. I dont regret a cent. First off the game can run on a factory PC with 4 gb of ram, no graphics card, and an i3 proccessor allthough its not too bad, and the drifting is great, I mean its better than grid 2 drifting and compares to autosport. The only unfortunate thing about the game is that it has no badge that comes with it."
"First of all: awesome game!  Great graphics, great stuff, great gameplay. Has a few things I would change but I will try Grid 2 late.  Recommended"
Play GRID now... i said NOW.. because its amazing

"Mechanics of the games are nice and all,Sponsors are all real and the amount of cars are a lot.However,the game should have added at least body customization.Overall,the game is great and I have enjoyed it;unless the Ravenwest appears and smoked you :P"
"Pro: Fun game with different cars. Challenging but love the crowd cheering. It takes a few times to get used to and even then, unless you're a pro or have the right equipment, you'll still finish last and crash a few times. But I definately see this as doable to get better. It'll just take awhile (unless you're an experienced racer) to get 3rd place or higher. Used a true xbox pc controller and worked great. Though a G27 is on my wish list, I wonder if it would make driving in this game easier and more fun. Realistic in the sense of when you crash into a wall, it tears up your car. And it's very possible to total your car to the point where you can't finish the track.  Con: Not for the absolute beginner.  Lots of curves, for better or worse. No casual play. No solo mode.  No training.  No practice runs. (Ok, I'm being redundant at this point.) Would wish it would be more forgiving on crashes and not tear up your car so much. But then I'm complaining because though I have a handful of racing games, I generally love them but I still suck. lol  I'd still recommend this game as it's one of the better racing games out there.  I bought this during the summer steam sale and glad I did. I think for many the normal $14.99 price is worth it for many as it's better than more expensive games out there. But for me the cheaper sale price was more realistic for my level of experience and skill.  If you are looking for similiar games but with a different flavor: Though more expensive, I would recommend Dirt 3 Complete Edition. It has so many options (cars, tracks, experience levels) and is a blast for an absolute beginner to the experienced. And less frustrating. Another good racing game that offer a different but varies skill levels are Riptide GP2 and Riff Racer (Drive Any Track). The only thing with Riff Racer is that it's solo with no AI. But it builds tracks on music you choose so I like it.  Finally, buy this game. You could pay more for other games but overall this game is worth the normal price for most."
I REALY hope they will make it online again   i'd love to drift with some one
The main reason I keep this game is that you can race Le Mans for 24 real hours !
"Amazing looking &amp; playing game. Runs @ 1080p 60fps in full settings with 50% usage on my 7850. Almost F1 like racing on some tracks, where the break button get as much use as the accelerator. Using an Xbox controller."
great racing game - very worth $2.99 - gaze into my nipple and despair
One of the best racing games I have ever played. :)
"Excellent driving. Great do-over mechanic. Good amount of content. One of my favorite, no, my favorite racing game of all time. Had it on the PS3 before I came to my senses and joined the PC master race (huehue race, get it? I'm sorry). So many times where I've been waddling in my seat trying to win a race thanks to the soundtrack.  The soundtrack is ♥♥♥♥ing amaze balls. Like seriously, it sounds like I'm racing for my life.  9/10, mainly because the online is closed. If the online was still enabled, then 10/10. Must buy."
"Grid may very well be the best racing game as far as actual gameplay goes . I have played most Need For Speed and Grand Turismo games and they still can't quite nail making racing feel competetive .   Here is what I like about Grid:  -Damage limitation and collision mechanics . If your car takes too much damage you may loose some control over it or completly stop . Forcing player to avoid collisions and slow down between turns makes it more like actual racing than ram simulator.  -Many beatiful cars and Maps . There are planty of different cars and events that all feel very different . Despite the age if this game it looks very good and I have no complaints .  -Realistic campaign . This may be viewed as a negative or positive thing but Grid makes carrier progression more like the real thing . You either work for other teams or as your own team, use only cars allowed for specific events and get sponsors .  -Cuztomizable diffeculty settings which is risk vs reward . You actually get more reputation for bumping hard settings .  What I don't like about Grid .  -Anything Green . If you even touch grass you can start singing Disney Frozen because you will be dancing on ice for awile . When you at that you might as well make a grass/mud golem and name him O♥♥♥♥ because you already lost the race .  -Not beeing able to properly customize and buy cars . No upgrades and you can't pick fastest car into a slow race just for fun ;(  If you like racing games and this game is on sale . Get it . Its pretty damn good ."
The Grid franchise is one of the best driving game that I ever played. It is a simulator racing but very arcadish control so dont be intimidated if you think this will a hardcore simulator racing. Get this! 10/10 would flashback again
"This is a quintessential racing title for anybody who like racing game. This game is one of my personal favorite games (put about 200 hours on PS3 when I was younger) and after playing it again recently, it plays just as I remember it.   However, without nostalgia lenses, I think this games age definitely shows. Firstly, the game can get fairly repetitive after the first couple of seasons. There are only a few cars, and even fewer tracks, and they get old fairly quickly. Secondly, the physics in this game are very arcade-y and are definitely comparable with arcade racers like Need For Speed over simulation games like GT or Forza. Although not necessarily a bad thing, it is not this games strong suit. Thirdly, the game's car customization is limited to changing the cars colors and preset liveries, and changing sponsors. This adds to the games limited replayability (if that is even a word).  However, even though all of that I would still recommend picking up this game on sale. The game still provides a racing experience incompatible to any other racing title even today. The feeling of managing your own racing team and working your way though a unique 20 car grid is still unreplicated to this day on any other racing title.  TL;DR Game definitely shows its age, however still pick it up on sale to experience one of the best racing games ever."
"A fun, entertaining and challenging game. I spent about 18 hours completing every mission, but I still play it every now and then for the fun.  7/10"
There's 24 hour races.  10/10
""
  Brings back great memories from when the game was brand new!
"Perfect image quality, great gamemode, and a lots of BEAUTIFUL cars."
"If the only racing games I could play for the rest of my life were this and Dirt 3, I'd be perfectly fine with that.  GRID is an older title, but it's aged extremely well. You can see the age showing a bit in the texture quality, but that's about it. Still sounds as good as any game today, still looks as good as any game today (aside from the occasional aforementioned low-res texture), and most importantly, still drives as good as any game today.  It's not full simulation, but it's not full arcade, either. It's right in that sweet spot that Codemasters nailed with their racing games of around this time. It's not so arcade that you could play with your feet, but it's not so simmy that you need to play with a wheel. Assists can be activated or deactivated until you get the driving as simple or as challenging as you want. The AI's difficulty can be configured, as well.  The multiplayer servers for this were shut down long ago, but if you apply some Google magic, you can find a way to play online again.  Honestly, it can run on a potato, and if you wait for a sale (which won't take long), it can be had for $3. A total bargain for what is still one of the best racing games on Steam."
Many years later. THIS GAME IS STILL GREAT !! &lt;3 Love it~
by far the best grid.
"This is a great racing game. I've enjoyed the single player career mode a lot, although I don't care for the lack of a calendar or some way to track season progress. Not too complicated like a racing sim. Just enough customization to add some of your own flair without getting bogged down in theorycrafting. Good fun at a good price."
"I used to play this game all the time on XFire, it brings back nostalgic memories of those days. Probably the best ra- ...Mmm, these noodles are good. Hold on, let me finish eating."
My favourite game of all time (so far) totally worth the price
nice game :D good mechanics and like ya
"As with most of Codemaster's games, this is a great racing game. Even taking into account that this game is 7 years old, the graphics are superb and have really stood the test of time! The racing is fluid also (as is to be expected with its age on modern hardware). For those with low-end graphics cards in SLI... this actually works in SLI (this will keep the temps down a bit on your GPUs too).  The game would only run in 1280 x 720 for me. So I did some digging around on the internet and found this to be because the VRAM is not detected properly. I changed a setting in an XML file, and got it running in full 1080p glory. This is the page I found the details at:    http://joshmccarty.com/2013/08/enable-higher-resolutions-for-grid-on-pc/   Enjoy the game. :)"
"This is a very good game. I recommend this game to anyone who loves racing games.  It has a career mode where you can participate in diverse racing series like F3, Drift, GT Series or even Le Mans. I also enjoy the customization of your cars where you can select a base vinyl and a lot of known sponsors that earn you a big load of money, and also the ability to choose your teammate (even though you shouldn't expect much from him, as usual).  There isn't as many cars, and it may become repetitive after a while, but it's still a fun game with a lot racing gamemodes.  And if you simply enjoy to race, this is a game that will deliver what you need to have enjoyable racing."
10/10 I love it.
"Good racing game, I'd recommend at $10 or lower"
Very good racing simulator.  Nothing superfluous. Just try
"Classic, badass racing game."
"Quite simply one of the best racing games.  It's one of those games that you can just come back to everytime, and have some fun.  Pros: -Good graphics for it's time (2008) -Doesn't crash -Doesn't require a powerful platform -Nice and easy physics -Wide selection of cars -Varaity of Motorsport catagorys -Decent damage module  Cons: -No multiplayer -A bit short, singeplayer wise. (In my opinion) -No DLC's for the PC version. DLC's are only available on consoles.  On sales, this game goes for very low and good prices. You should get it! You won't regret it  9.5/10"
The only good GRID
salt sim 2008   if you enjoy getting salty this is the game for you
"Basically, the physics are terrible. There are driving physics like GTA where it's meant to be slightly funny, and there are physics like Gran Turismo and other driving simulators that are meant to be serious and realistic. This game tries to be somewhere in between and fails miserably. Your car seems to weigh about 1lb and the AI's around 2000lb or so. If you car barely touches theirs, you'll go flying off the track and they won't even move. Also, if you just touch the sand/grass even a little, your car spins out. That's it.  If you want a fun driving sim, stick to GTA or Midnight Club or Dirt. A real driving sim like Arsetto Corsa or Gran Turismo would suit you better if you want a more realistic driving experience (yeah, I know. Gran Turismo's not on PC). Either way, I'm glad this was on sale so I didn't waste too much money."

I highly recommend.......
Graphix are nice and gameplay is smooth and fun! Must have for anyone into driving/racing games!
This is my first simulator racing game. I played in 2010 with crack version because at that time I don't know how to buy a game. But this game is so ♥♥♥♥ing great and I've never been fed up with it :D.
My favourite game of all time (so far) totally worth the price
nice game :D good mechanics and like ya
"Should be in your top 5 list for racing games. Not a sim, not arcade but somewhere in the middle. Race, challenge and drift modes infintely replayable. The game needs nothing more unlike the flawed sequel that followed it. Graphcis are gorgeous considering how old this game is. Conrols are intuitive and the gameplay entertaining."

"Well this was fun. Fast action racing game without any unnecessary blows and whistles. A lot of cars that do behave and sound differently. Really messed up the turn? No problem, just hit Enter and rewind the time for a few seconds before the crash. Failed the tournament? It's OK, because you can try it again. Too hard to handle turns? Simply turn on the assist and lower the difficulty level.  Very laid back and forgiving arcade that does have some issues. Car stats are quite cosmetical and the final 'battle' against Ravenwest is a huge disappointment. I mean why in the world would you be riding in a straight line for 1 minute in a car that reaches maximum speed in 10 seconds. Was really expecting a crazy dark night ride in Japan and some drifting before removing this baby from the disk. It does end up beeing very unbalanced and way too arcade-ish sometimes.  It is still a joyful experience that is well-worth the current price tag."

10/10 awesome racing game  Edit:  Bottoms of the Cars dont have enough detail 9/10
  One of the best racing games I've played.
"really love grid,but grid 1 better than grid 2"
"Just amazing...  MORE: This game is one of the few racing games that actually gives me adrenaline rush, it's loads of fun to play in cockpit mode and it makes it a little more challenging. AI can be aggressive and they get pretty crazy on extreme mode. But the feeling of starting in 10th and overtaking every single car to 1st place is just awesome!"
"I got this with the Codemasters pack. Not as good as Dirt 2, but still very good and a different type of racing. Use a controller or steering wheel."
Great racing game.
Bought in the sale for £1.99 and I can honestly say it's one of the smartest decisions I've made. One of the best racing games I've ever played to date. 10/10
great game but it sucks **** without a controller or wheel or whatever you have for it
Sheer-brilliant!
best racing game ever
"The game that started me on Steam! I have played around 100 hours on this, and I'm sure I'll play more in the future. Online racing is where it is at though. The single player story mode is a bit tedious, but with a huge variety of cars and tracks, it is still interesting.  UPDATE: Avoid it now. The multiplayer option is no more. So it can still be a fun single player game, but the main attraction was the multiplayer."
"I LOVE this game. Especially because it fits right in, between arcade racing of NFS and realism of racing sims.  I use a controller, and would reccomend one.   Decent for killing time, especially when I'm offline. The tracks are plenty, there are a handful of disciplines and cars, hence racing varies, but most of it is ontrack. Make your own team, hire and fire teammates, buy new cars and level up your licence. 8.5/10"
"9/10 A great racing game.  End game is a bit limited but everything leading up to it is full of great racing, great cars and some decent AI.  The graphics are beautiful, the racing mechanics are pretty good and is definately a racing game worth buying."
"even though i am recomending this game it is only because i feel it has a place. i'll do this in a pro vs con format  pros: - drifting is intuitive and easy to pick up - has a racing team system with custom colours e.c.t - sponsor system is good - graphics are decent - good use of controler support (using a xbox controler the aceleration from the trigger is smooth)  cons: - AI leaves alot to be desired - no vehicle setup at all - hard to judge cornering speed required in grip driving - real strong arcade feel - hard to figure appropiate skills in a new team driver (i have one specialising in drift does better in touring cars ) - hard to search for new team driver  - shiny reflective roads at night (i mean come on stop doing this) - little bumps can cause loss of control (ripple strips can cause your car to spin out) - used car purchasing (ebay) seems pointless - team manager gives useless or incorect advice at times and sometime annoys you by telling you your in first place after you have been there for the last 2 laps e.c.t.  although i don't really like the game it is ok for passing some time, good for causal racing or arcade racing fans but i can't recomend for serious racing fans like my self. i would have figured being a codemasters game it would be better than this but i was mistaken.  note: i recieved this game as a gift and after plaing this for 10 minutes i would not have purchased it. however like i said above it is still good for wasting some time."
Best Racing game ever. better than NFS DIRT (but I love dirt2) and ...... yes GRID2 GRID &gt; GRID2
Best racing game ever made
One of the Best Racing Games Out There!
Best racing simulator of all time!
.
It's pretty good. 7.5/7.5 perfect score!
This game is so realistic it's so hard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
.
Just epic!!!
the best online racing game ever.
"Had this gem a few years ago, bought it on CD. Finally decided to buy it on steam.   I wish there was still some online playing available. But still this is the best racing game I have played."
Probably one of the best racing experiences out for PC.
1 word for this game: DRIFT
this game is owesome. i recomender it for all players who like cars
"I pick this game on sale and If you are looking for an arcade-simulation racing game at a good price, GRID is one of the best out there.   Pros: The graphics are pretty decent for for a 8 years old game. Low to mid spec PCs requirements. Nice responsive AI.   Cons: Non-functional multiplayer. Lack of Steam achievements.  If you like some racing cars games in arcade like mode, look no more, this one is for you."
"Wow, made in 2007 and amaze with the graphic!!  Good job codemaster!"
"A good arcade racing game with good car physics and simulation-like handling. Multiplayer is dead, but you can still use tunngle or any similar services such as hamachi. Also LMAO if you play with assists"
It's Fun.
"This is a very solid racing game. Set the difficulty to novice or easy and it plays more like an arcade. Or set the difficulty to expert and play it like a simulator. Has lots of different cars each with it's own unique way of handling. The racks are fairly diverse and each one has multiple setups, which helps to keep it exciting and not repetitive. It has a flashback system that allows you to turn back time if you get into a crash. I n my opinion it doesn't work very well and is sometimes useless. But the majority of the time it works fine, albeit very clumsy to operate. The game physics are also quite good, but after you play for a while I can't help notice certain blaring flaws, especially in hit detection and how your car handles when it gets hit.  The sounds are all quite good. The graphics, quite frankly, are amazing for 2007. They look as good as any racing game from 2010 or even 2011.  Probably my biggest issue with the game is the AI. The problem is they aren't affected the same way I am by the game phyics. If I get hit by a car, a certain outcome will occur, but when the AI gets hit in the same way, they will not be affected the same. Usually the result is if I get hit, my car flies wildly out of control, if the AI gets hit they will recover very easily and lose no speed. It's very difficult to spin out the AI or make them crash.   I give it an 8.3/10."
"One of the best racing games ever made, but they discontinued the online play, and with no split screen its a bust if you are looking to game with buddies."
Best racing game on steam.
One of the best racers out there. The graphics and gameplay still hold up. THE racer to buy.
This game is almost 7yrs old and still looks amazing and is still a damn good game. Honestly folks how many of you race super cars? Call the game Arcade or call it a simulation you honestly for the most part don't know how cars handle so who are you judge they did wrong or right with this.......it is a game have fun with it.  10/10
"Very realistic racing simulator, for moments it can be frustrating as well. It's such a shame that the online mode is ruined by cheaters or players that only want to annoy you by going on the wrong way of the track.  My Rating: 8/10"
"One of the best racing games ever made, but they discontinued the online play, and with no split screen its a bust if you are looking to game with buddies."
Definitely one of the best racing games out there. It is a nice blend of arcade and sim which really let's you have fun without making it too hard or easy to play.
One of the best racers out there. The graphics and gameplay still hold up. THE racer to buy.
Great game. Can be frustating in harder levels when it becamos much more a simulator. PLay it with an XBox Controller or a wheel.
One of the best racing games. Not optimazed for win7.
"Holds up pretty well today. Graphics are perfectly acceptable, but everything has a weird yellow-ish tint to it; try fiddling with your screen setting to give things a more realistic look. Lots of cars, tracks, and the gameplay is varied across each type of race. I like this game a lot, but I'd only reccomend it if your PC isn't good enough for GRID 2 or DiRT 3, or if it's on sale. I picked it up for $6, and it was a great purchase.  10/10 Would crash into a wall, roll over three times, and wait eight seconds to have your car respawn onto the track again."
"Well, I am officially the worse driver in this game. I float so much it's like drifting, and I am bad at drifting. It's a pretty fun game, but I am too use to NFS that it's quite hard to get use to any other kind of driving mechanics. I am button happy lol."

"Great racing experience. Very intense, graphics are outstanding. Feels more real than any of the other racing games I have played. Unfortunately the multiplayer servers are shut down which I did not realize until I got the game, but I still highly enjoy the game.  Only cons: - No open world - Very minimal customization"
This game is so realistic it's so hard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TOTALLY in love with replays!
5/5 i like the mehanix and graphs are kinda good for game thats 8 years old
Your tires are ice. The track is ice. Every car is ice.  Fun as heck.
"Well, I am officially the worse driver in this game. I float so much it's like drifting, and I am bad at drifting. It's a pretty fun game, but I am too use to NFS that it's quite hard to get use to any other kind of driving mechanics. I am button happy lol."
10/10 Great (GRID) Racing Game (y)         GRID - Touring Cars - BMW Challenge&nbsp;
"One of the best racing games I've played - the damage is very realistic which is a plus, a controller to play this game would be easier but a keyboard works just as fine. But don't expect this to be a realist racing simulator, it's a arcade game.  10/10 "
"Finally got it started. Having installed some open32 dll, what it took was going to an administrator account and starting the game there before starting the game in a standard account, also ran it as an administrator in the compatability options, might have made a difference.  Lots of silly fun. I'm afraid I cheat and restart the races when I get punted of track, which is often, and I'm finally learning to race using the in car views instead of exteriors.  It ran and looks great even on Intel 4600 intergrated and doesn't even list 1080p as a graphics option! (OK apparently having now read progerman's review the lack of 1080p is a VRAM misread and can be reset!)"

"Great racing experience. Very intense, graphics are outstanding. Feels more real than any of the other racing games I have played. Unfortunately the multiplayer servers are shut down which I did not realize until I got the game, but I still highly enjoy the game.  Only cons: - No open world - Very minimal customization"
It's pretty good. 7.5/7.5 perfect score!
This game is so realistic it's so hard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10/10 Great (GRID) Racing Game (y)         GRID - Touring Cars - BMW Challenge&nbsp;
TOTALLY in love with replays!
"The game may be old but it is still great fun!  The two only down sides are the not so great keyboard controls and low resolution. But besides that buy it, you won't regret it."
For me absolut best racing game
Easily one of the best racing games ever made.
The best racing game!

"Great racing game. I believe online has been revoked now, but still it's a cracking game."
 General Gameplay
"I purchased GRID recently on steam to race with friends and relive some of the great racing moments we had when it was first released. Unfortunately, we found out that GRID is showing its age, requiring a lot of manual tweaking just to run under a modern PC (x64 win10). And even then, the handling felt loose and lagging on a wheel config and the force feedback so linear was better off (G27), with the occasional FPS dips here and there (1080p @ 60fps). So in all honesty, it would be hard to recommend an aging GRID game, if you don't already have it, with so many other newer racing titles offering the same or superior experience for a similar price (see from the same franchise e.g. Grid Autosport &amp; Grid 2). Nevertheless, I will give it the thumbs up, cause it has given me countless hours of online racing mayhem when it used to be current."
"Got this game as a gift and wondering what is wrong with multiplayer... If you love car games, NFS and simmilar series then you should try the GRID... Below are my cons and pros for the game :  Pros :  Best damage system to date Flashback system works well Mind-blowing visuals A lot of variety Cars control beautifully (Untill you spin) Rewardable Sponsors You can have your own team -------------  Cons :  A few technical issues - slowdowns mainly Le Mans races suck Can't get Multiplayer work with STEAM No Steam Achievements  -------------  Game is worth it to those who love racing on tracks :)      "
"Your car gets dirty, so you have to clean it. 10/10~Best car cleaning simulator of 2015."
"Here's a tip for all of you beginners: Drive slowly, not fast."
Still the best ! love it          YouTube™ Video:  --Drift edit-- Race driver : GRID - Silvia S15 - 2013 HD&nbsp;
"Good car handling, fun racing, great tracks, no unnecessary frills.  Unlike subsequent codemasters games, this game manages to avoid many of the annoying tropes of the genre. You're not forced to spend a long time in menus, listening to audio clips, or watching cutscenes between races. You can just jump straight from one race to the next, which is what it's all about. There is no slow-motion crash camera to frustrate you every time you wipe out, and the car's steering matches your inputs on the controller rather than slowing it down to simulate a driver turning a steering wheel.  There is no story, and car upgrades and customization play a minimal part in the game. Game modes are mainly straight races."
"Very good game but for some reason the in race sound doesn't work for me, I have researched this on the internet and it seems to be a big problem with this game, I'm using windows 8."
"Pretty fun, fun, addictive, and has a great sense of speed. If your new to the GRID franchise or racing games in general, pick this one up over GRID 2 and Autosport as this game is LEAPS ahead of those two games."
The game engine is awesome! But the AI and difficulty setting is still very lacking. Especially AI is very poor.
"After 7years this game still looks very strong and nice, bought for 2.59 euros, totally worth it"

  can't tell to buy or not to buy cause my childhood racing games started with nfs and between nfs and grid . nfs win easly but still not that bad racing game with really high fps even if your pc not that much
"When I first saw this game I was not that overly interested. I thought it would be another one of those racing games like forza horizon or another game in the series, but to my surprise it was very different. To begin with the game does not contain violence apart from the fact you can crash your car, but then again it would not be much of a racer if there were no crashes. The story mode to the game is lengthy and most of the time enjoyable with lots of things to do and lots of races to compete in. Almost anyone would be able to play it as it has simple controls and at the end of the day it is really fun."
"One of the best games I have ever played. This game beats out GRID 2 and Autosport easily. The two games are still good just not as good as GRID 1. Easily the best of the GRID series and easily better than most NFS titles available. GRID 1 takes first place with GT, Midnight Club and a few NFS games to tie for best Car racing games, but Grid 1 is either tied or second place to those titles depending what kind of racing game person you are. Debatable for many on which is best among franchises, personally I say this ties with GT series for best and most realisitic physics etc. The game is easily better than most Burnout and NFS recent titles, and DIRT is nothing in comparison to Grid 1. While the game is old (2007) it's still quite ahead of it's time in general especially ahead of the GT released at the time. Visuals are very very very appealing, fun factor is awesome since it's got a balance of the basic arcade and GT realistic kind of gameplay. However anyone who found GT series a bit rough as in difficult this is just about as difficult but a little easier. This is one of the 'Essentials' for Steam like Valve/steam exclusive games but this one I think is easily in the top 5 Valve/Steam exclusives list. I reccomend the game to anyone who likes racing games and wants a new experience on the racing world with a large selection of cars to choose from. I would give the game a 9/10 with it's only con being the circuits. I for one like the open world/city street racing feel from Midnight Club and NFS games which this game doesn't offer and the circuits are a bit bland for me at times. As for Pros: Realism but no too realistic that it's annoying, fun factor, replay value and it's distinct system in general for records etc. Replays are awsome in this game compared to many others and thankfully if you don't like replays you don't have to have them. (Note: the replays are slow mo and detailed like in Matrix Trilogy :D so it's super cool etc.) As for who can play it..good news: works on just about any PC especially cheap ♥♥♥ HP laptops etc. with Celeron but on lowest lowest settings etc. Must have for all on steam! I forgot to mention that many people may think this to be just a Need For Speed ProStreet rip off but it's not. If you disliked Prostreet and GT series this series is like the amplified version of pro street with th eonly common factor between the two is a few cars are in both games and that prix racing is mostly similar but the rest is unique. With GT haters the game is alike but it's unique with a lot of options to make the gameplay flow without difficult AI etc. Online no longer works and it's OST (Original Soundtrack) is not a compilation OST it's a instrumental score :'( for those who like to listen to varied genres along with the instrumental scores."
"My most played game. The cars each have individual handling characteristics which will keep you coming back. Graphics are awesome (make sure to follow a graphic tweak guide for best results). Make sure you have an Xbox controller for best playback, wheel might be ever better but you need a controller at least."
"meh, how on earth you have a hyper realistic racing simulator without being able to tune individual car is beyond me. You can heavily custimized how input effects driving (dampining and deadspots for: steering, accelleration, and braking), but its global and you change cars every race, of which are completely different and require a completely different input style, ie drifting vs circuit. So you end up having to write down your input settings and change them per race. STUPID STUPID.  Would make infinitly more sense to have the settings applied to PER car (which all handle differently to begin with), or maybe even PER race type. Not some stupid global setting that you have to change per car per race.   And why the hell can i not tune the cars?!!?! Absolutely amazingly realistic simulator (cars take real damage), you can do everything (manage your racing team, sponsers actually give money, buy/sell cars (even place/make bids on the games fake ebay!), everything but tune the cars!"

i have issues when i start the game it glitches on the intro and then quits by the way im on windows 8.1...wel how to fix ?
Slovak teammate speaking with asian accent.  10/10 would mute again.
Best PC racing game I have ever played.
Unrealistic and literally just annoying. Ew.
"Old, but still great (except drifting). A lot of fun, amazing cars, stunning graphics. My favourite arcade racing game."
Love this game! Great buy
"Grid what cani say thats new to everyone, well nothing, its a great racing game that cn be easy or hard to play. It has nice gmeplay and pretty good graphics and amazing sound. the races can be quite short which is a pain but in the practice races you can make them aslong as you like."
I really like this!

"Great racing game, great gameplay. A must buy "
"What can I say. Love this game, it is just perfect!"
Used to be a Gran Turismo fan on the old PS console but this game puts it to shame. One of the hardest racing games I have ever played and I love it :o)
Old but good.
"I'm still recommending this since the graphics look nice and I kinda had fun. But damn. I guess if you're into that whole 'using your brakes' thing that this might be the game for you. But screw that, nerds. Beatnik-Filmstar gotta go fast. Ain't got time for the pedal on the left. Or a clutch. Manual transmissions are also for nerds."

Good quality racing game 10/15
P. cool.
" Most essential part about GRID:  What to expect. Sure, it's rather old game, but let me give you an insight to what to expect.  A proper racing game? No. A good, exciting racing experience? Yeah.    Reasoning  Why do I think so? I finally finished the last challenge. It doesn't matter how fast you are. This is not about knowing every inch of the racetrack, about knowing your car well. The AI doesn't care if you're fast, you just oblige to a rule set. As soon as you do that, you get exciting races: As in overtaking, being overtaken. You do get your fair share of intense position fights. But: as said, it doesn't matter if you're fast. You'll get wrecked because of collisions, not because you are too slow.  That is inherently a bad thing for me. Although, in the end, it doesn't really matter. Grind through the racing carreer, then take the fun. The fun really starts, when you got all the cars and will be able to choose the car you fancy, the track you'd like to battle and off you go. From there on, the racing becomes more fun. I miss the replays though. But shaving off parts of a second every round is the stuff that makes racing games shine. But as said, that doesn't really mean much in GRID's main part.  The some words about the  mechanics : Take this with a grain of salt, as I haven't raced a real Mazda 787B (who'd have thought). BUT. You turn in well on braking, you turn well on accelerating. You won't turn on neutral. I highly doubt that's how cars behave. As much as I've driven fast cars, this simply isn't true. In that sense, GRID is a very arcadey game, but ends up being fun anyways.   The cars  As much as I love to drive the Mazda 787B and the Nissan 390, the game lacks in the essential racing category: The Le Mans racers. Why do I choose between a Mustang and a Charger, while I miss a Mercedes C9, a Porsche 962 and the likes of the McLaren F1 GTR? Probably the Bentley Prototype? It's a great pleasure to get your hands on the Audi R10 TDI, but the again, why did they stop there? You got to choose many Drift Cars (although I do love them), but those are more like a side story to the main event Le Mans. And as far as GT-Racing goes, it's utterly sad that they didn't get licences for the japanese GT-series (nowadays SuperGT). But those might be locked to Gran Turismo, as I haven't seen any other game sporting those amazing machines. It's especially strange as the JLOC Lamborghini actually made it into the game - as well as a racing team called RE Amemiya. Just missing essential Le Mans racers. In the end, there are quite some nice cars to drive, but the roster is chosen rather weirdly."
"Great racing game, great gameplay. A must buy "
Can great a racing team  10/10 Would fire teamate again
Cool.
this game is S*X best car silvia :P
"GRID is a very nice lookng and well played game, when i started smashing into every wall was kinda alright, now only one hour in it is very difficult withou a contoller :("
Amazing Race Game
Great racing game!
I love this game!
Such a great game! hours of fun!
"i was once told by a freind that having a dodge viper as the cover car was bad luck for a racing game i showed him this game he said it was a one off and wouldnt happen again. he loves forza horizon 2 so from my experiance if it has a viper for the cover the games gonna be epic and this is just that, worth every cent."
"This is a great game, lots of car choices and lots of locations and tracks, and great scenery. The cars handle well using a keyboard with WSAD or whatever keys you assign. I don't use a wheel or controller so can't comment on those. Some people are having trouble with Windows 10 getting it to work, but it works fine for me with Windows 7 64bit. I know there are much newer racing games that are probably fancier, but this one has everything I want, and the price is unbelievably low on this special deal this week. I would highly recommend it if you like racing or even just driving through great scenery."
"Short:I would recommend this game, even without the sale.  Long: I like the career mode because you can name your team and racer, and even hire new racers once you get higher licenses. And listening to the occasional chatter on the radio is cool also. Pretty good graphics IMO. I like the damage your car can take and give. I LOVE how you can race as many season as you want in career mode!!! 1 bad thing is you can't customize a team logo but not really a big deal. I would def. recommend buying this game."
"This game is awesome, the graphics aren't bad, the game is light (so bad PC's can play it well), and the career is cool too. You start by doing little jobs to get 75k money, with that money you get a car and start racing for your own team in championships, if you do well you will also earn sponsors that will then provide more money, i recommend this game 100% It's gr8 m8, i r8 8/8."

Not bad. A little neveracking without assist though. Don't even let me begin telling you how painful it is to do the first race to get your rookie lisense without some of the assits on. its not a horrible pickup for 2.99.
"I remember playing this on xb360, Still the Best Handling for an arcade racer.  Bought this on sale, well worth it.  For best handling and feel i rate these arcade games in order. GRID&gt;Split/Sceond&gt;NFS Hot Pursuit.  All 3 are the holy trinity of Arcade racing games, good graphics/sound and handling.   This game still has some of the best Ai driver moments.   A few things to add if you want to expierence GRID to the fullest are these links of mods you should install.    http://www.moddb.com/mods/broskis-updated-grid  Get rid of yellow tint in game fora more realistic look. overwrite the 'tracks' folder in Grid with the one in the mods file.    https://joshmccarty.com/2013/08/enable-higher-resolutions-for-grid-on-pc/  To get 1080p instead of 720p limit, follow the instructions here according to your graphics card memory.   http://www.moddb.com/mods/8-ball-prestige-packs-dlc-pc  Gives the DLC packs that were only included with the mac edition that aren't available on pc.

Very good autosim (except for the drift races).
Best racing game with the most detail cockpit view design of all time.
A good game compared to other Grid Games in my opinion.

"Great racing game, It was so good i bought the Steam version too (I have the Xbox version too) 9/10"
"One of the best racing games i have ever played, on a par with forza 4 and better than all the need for speed games. This game has a load of camera angles (including first person), loads of cars, tracks and also types of race. Best value for your money. If you want a racing game get this one first as it is cheep and the best."
"Grid is a great racing simulator that holds up even to this day. Grid puts you to the test in various races that can be difficult, yet entertaining. There are many cars to choose from, and they all function differently. Grid has a fairly generic story that doesn't add or take away anything from the game. The graphics, though from 2008, are fantastic even today and further help to immersie yourself in the game. Controls work well with a keyboard, but even better with a wheel setup. Grid runs very well on my PC, and it is one of the few racing sims that is able to do so. Overall pick this game up if you're interested, espically if you see it on sale like I did."
Arcade driving at its best.
"Very nice game, but sometime it's boring."
brb gonna score 5 mill on the drift events and laugh at how easy they are
"Very good game, went into a wall at 200km/h suffered minor left front wheel damage 11/10, no but on the other hand this game is still amazing after 7 years."

I hate this game
Very nice game ! it keeps me at the edge of my seat.Especially drift mode made me thrilled. I strongly recommend it!!!!!!!!!!! 
"I have always thought this has been one of the best racing games ever due to the cool crashes and the nice physics, if you like racers you should definitely give this one a try."
The racing mechanis in this game are edgy and corner cutting. I would highly recommend an X-Bach controller for this one. You don't really get to pick a car you take what's given for the heat. The race car choice is communistic. The money is fast though but not easy to race to. I gave this game three wheels peeling out of four tires.
great game      10/10 would play again
This game is the best! Everyone should play it!
One of the better arcade racers.
"My favorite racing game of all time used to be the Need for Speed series during it's old glory days but I must say that Codemasters KNOW how to make great games and GRID is no exception. Cars handle well and the graphics are great. I would pick this up when it is on sale because finding good or even great racing games these days is almost impossible.  Thank you for reading, Peace. ;)"
Classic racing game with nice career mode but lacks comfortable multiplayer. This game offers very good single player expererience. Even though it's almost 8 years old by the time this review has been written it aged pretty well. It offers a nice variety of tracks and cars and will keep you busy for quite some time given the price this game will cost you. Force Feedback controller or steering wheel is strongly recommended. AI can be pretty dull at times but this game still offers competetion and replayability due to high individual configuration of driving assistants and fixed cockpit views. Do not expect multiplayer to work: unfortunately servers are dead and you will need hamachi to set up a proper multiplayer game. All in all a recommendation especially for people with low budget computers on search for a nice and solid single player racing game.
"It is not a brilliant game! Not even for an arcade one. The cars seems to float over the road and the A.I. has no idea where you are, he simply wants to go on the raceing line and it will bump and push the player irationally. When the car goes offtrack it spins around back wheels as it is pin-pointed on them, even with traction control on. Difficulty spikes are often in this game, one race you win easely and on the next there is a team that run past you very quick, even though you are in the same car, on a straight line. As pro's it has a lots of cars and classes, cool soundtrack, nice menu design, graphics (for it's time)."

"If you think you're good at racing games because you're good at NFS. ♥♥♥♥♥ please! This game blows all the ♥♥♥♥ you do in NFS. This is the real ♥♥♥♥. Racing as fun, competitive, violent and awesome as it supposed to be. Grid is where real racing gamers do.  I played NFS before and thought I'll be good at this. DEAD WRONG! This brings the reality of racing, unlike NFS gives you a ♥♥♥♥ing 'tank' with sealed side roads. You aint have none of those ♥♥♥♥ in here. and THATS why it's 10 times better,"

"Have, several race games, this is different, a must have, will play more when I need a break from rally"
"  Has the real word feature in it...  By the way, the graphics from the pictures dont show up in game ;("
My favorite racing game. I think this game is even better than Need for Speed! Especially physics of the car. It is divine!
yo man this ♥♥♥♥ is the tightest like fo rel all. if you dont expirenc this game like i did then u wont evr get to fell the greatness that drift tho amiright itl turn you blue 
"Great graphics and playability, but bit annoying to have to keep going back to the keyboard for the menu"
"The cars in this game lose control at the slighest bend, and what is worse, instead of just going straight ahead like there is no tomorrow, they actually fly up in to the air and flip around and around, and where they stop is anybodys guess!  If you're one of the players that like this type of thing, have fun!!!  As for me, it is Pointless garbage, however, I got the game in a humble bundle, so no real loss if I don't play it much!"
"Kinda fun racing, pity about no multiplayer."
  Hello all! Does someone know how to setup the Logithech g29 to grid 1 and 2? Thanks in hand!
One of the best Racing games
Great Game
This is probably the best racing game right next to DiRT 3 and Test drive unlimited 2. If you need a good racing game but don't want to pay a lot for it this is the perfect game for you!
Great game
Fun Factor Reviews - the only measure is pleasure   + Good balance between arcade and sim  + Looks great and gives a fantastic sense of speed  + LAN mode is an absolute blast with friends  + Great feel to the cars and an impressive damage model  + Rewinding in single player mitigates the relative ease to crash out  Highly recommended
"Release Date: 4 Jun, 2008 And its so cool game!"
Single player review:  - would be the best game if the career would be more engaging.  + the rest is quite nice

The best car game after NFS Underground 2 :)  10/10
"Really nice racing sim/arcade mix, excellent game for really cheap!"
"This is a really fun, compelling racing game. The career mode may be the best of the GRID series."
Neat and Fun way to Cheat in the game. Go into the files for the game and delete the Folder named AI. Your game will run exactly the same as it did before except your opponets and teammate wont move. They just sit at the starting line. Easy 1st place wins.
"This game is really good, it reminds me of Project Gotham in alot of ways. Could do with more street racing and a few tweeks but is the best racing game on the PC still without a doubt, even after all this time (though I haven't played Project Cars yet to be fair).  Beats it's sequels too. Best Grid game, nay, best racing game on PC that I have ever played."
6/10 I hate the camera while steering but that's how all GRID games are.
Crap. Not recommended.

"I love this race game , i will play it all time when i can ! = )"
"the reason i bought this game is the music theme in main menu, its giving me eargasm"
This game is SO ironic. You can choose 'Dumptruck' as your nickname and drive really fast and make hipsters go wild with your irony. 10/10 for giving me hipster cred.
"I've only played 15 minutes on the PC, though I've played it more on console.   It's a good game, a good racing game, for sure."
You know it's bad when this is the best game in the series
"I've only played 15 minutes on the PC, though I've played it more on console.   It's a good game, a good racing game, for sure."
Real Good One !
Old skool fun. where i first playing this game i loved it. and even now i still like it 8/10
I spun out of control on the second track when I turned all the assists off. Driving in sand is easily the worst thing to ever do. I rage quited after 100 restarts. Decided to play Bejeweled 3 instead. 10/10.
Easily one of the best racing games ever created.
This game is RACEist  If you didn't find this joke funny I hope you get hit by a car and die.
"edit 7/25/2015: after a revisit of the game i have concluded that GRID 1 is the perfect embodiment of pure real racing. it may not be a 'Sim' but it captures the essence of racing perfectly.   original review: 2008. i try GRID 1 for the first time. i find out that it is probably the best racing game of the century. I will always remember all of the good times and races i had in GRID, both SP and MP. it was an amazing experience, and everyone, i mean everyone, who is interested in racing games owes it to themselves to play GRID through."
"Was a very good game when it first came out, and still is 7 years later. Great career progression system, and a very clear goal at the end of it, but still one that is not easy to get. I do think this is better than Grid 2, but would still recommend both."
I am by no means a racing fan but this game is awesome! Everything from the menus to racing is top notch. **You will definately need a racing wheel or an analog controller to play this.
"This was fun, i wonder why the ♥♥♥♥ didn't they put cockpit view in GRID 2, amazing experience to put the pedal to the metal and view your surroundings just fly past."
"This game is fun points gathering, when you get your steering configurations right and can hold on your drifting and get insane points. There is fully fun lan mayhem ready."
"GRID's reputation as one of the best racing games is well deserved. As has been mentioned, it finds that perfect sweet spot between 'arcade' racing and hard-core simulation and just goes flat out with it. The sheer variety in gameplay is also impressive. The tracks range from tight, city-based runs to wide-open racetracks to mountain roads, most with variations; the cars all handle quite differently, from open-wheel to stock to supercars; and the events can be straight laps, drift, downhill, demolition, and more. Even the same tracks can feel quite different when equipped with different classes of cars. The career mode is also lots of fun, ramping up the challenge in an appropriate way. Acquiring and managing new cars and sponsors was more fun than I expected.  I'm no racing guy, but it's amazing how much more of an experience this is from arcade-drive-gaming. It's the perfect combination of challenging and forgiving, and lots and lots of in-the-zone fun. Take some time with it and dig in; it's one hell of a ride."
"-FIRST THOUGHTS RECCOMENDATION- This game isn't really a perfection, but it is good. I wouldn't really get it if it's not on sale(got it for 4.5€). If you get off the track you spin out every time, this is very un-realistic and makes you kinda mad. Other drivers follow the difficulty setting. Cool feature is flashbacks-reverse time back and maybe correct a corner etc. Cars are not really detailed, but are fair enough. Before each race you also choose one of three objectives thatyou can complete for extra cash. Game seemed to have an online multiplayer feature too, which was abandoned later on(there is this option in the menu, but it doesn't want to connect to the internet). Final thoughts: Game is good, would need some improvements tho(buy other Codemasters driving games if you must!)  My raating: 6/10"
One of the best arcade style racers I have ever played. I just wish they would get around to making a second one.
Picked it up on sale for $3 and change. May be 5 years old but it's not like racing games have changed that much. Great value and great fun!
"Never really was a fan of race games.... untill Grid. Gotten so many good times out of this game, the campaign is fun and multiplayer with friends is a blast and even the normal online scene is still pretty strong. It's an arcade racing sim... think that's the best way to describe it.... not realistic enough to be called a sim, but it's a lot more ''sim'' then tons of other racing games..."
"Excellent racing title, huge number of tracks and great semi-simulation arcade gameplay."
"Play this game, because racekar"
"Oldie, but goldie  For quick paced racing fun, can't beat sticking on Grid for a while. Game experience is more fun with a wheel."
First impression: it looks like someone has urinated on my screen. Evidently this game was subject to the god awful trend of fugly post-filters that a lot of arcade racers had.
"10/10  Still my favorite racing game after many, many years, The game is not a simulation, like forza and not an arcade, like need for speed where you can ram ino a wall with your zonda R and come out clean. It is defenetly balanced more towards simulation though. Defenetly a harder game for the beginers no fancy assists, just the TCS, STM and ABS, although the AI is real easy and is great for learing with. Playing in 'serious' and 'savage' sorta makes it more fun, and because of the damage system, you can't use the car in front of you as a brake and makes the game a little more competitive, compared to the basic, where the AI's brake real, real early. Physics engine is spot on and efficent and the graphics, when turned to MAX, are up to par with today's racing games"
This is by far the best driving game for the pc. And there's drift.
"This game teach you how to make some interest to sponsor and how to drive like a real world racer, Try to race with cockpit mode and feel the enjoyable World series and dont forget... dont hit the grass or you'll lose your race"
"Very real feel, Id like to custom my cars but really everything else was totally great. From the crashes to the simulation of the driving very realy feel like I said. EPIC racing game for anyone.. Worth it."
One of the best racers ever!
Excellent mix of arcade and simulation driving.
"Still one of the greatest Racing Games. If you like racing (sim or arcade, since this game supports both groups) you should definitely pick this game up!  + Great Feeling (Steering, the acceleration just feels right) + Has all the best of racing. From musclecars to european racingcars all the way to japanese drifters. + Great Graphics, can even be enhanced by Mods + Modding support (You can download the Mac-exclusive DLC's or Mods for better particles) + Did i mention drifting? Not many games do it as well as GRID (1) + Runs smoothly, even on older PC's ________________________________________________________________  - There is a bug, that won't let you choose your resolution, since you GPU is too new for the game to recognise it - The game sometimes just crashes with no apparent reason. This only happens on very few occasions   Would I recommend this game? YES! It's really good and with it's price at 2.5$ in sales it is really worth it."
"GRID is a fun racing game with a lot of great tracks, cars, and disciplines to choose from. The Flashback system is really great for players that miss a turn or get into a crash and don't want to restart the race from the beginning. The level of difficulty can be tweaked to one's liking by increasing/decreasing the AI difficulty and turning on/off driver assits like traction control (doing so will also affect the amount of repuation points you can recieve). The only major downside to this game for me was that the AI can be really aggressive to the point where I am usually being ran off the course. Even on it's 'Basic' difficulty, an AI car always manages to spin out once per lap. Overall, GRID is a great racer to play and enjoy."
Very great arcade-ish driving game. A good line between casual Need for Speed and Mario Kart and the very serious Gran Turismo and Forza series.
10/10 -not ign cars are fast 
"This game is badass. Looks and plays better than the new Forza, imo. #pcmasterrace FTW 11/10"
this is a very fun racing game for everyone but i would not recomend trying to play it with out a controller
By far the best racing game out there... BUY IT NOW!
Excellent racing game. On par with Project Gotham and Gran Turismo. The additional team drivers makes it stand out a bit in my opinion.
Juar take a seat and enjoy the ride.
"One of the best racing games from Codemasters, which keeps great balance between arcade and simulation driving."
By far the best racing game I've ever played.
Buy it for the menu music alone.A great racing game with good potential to be the best.
"Can be arcade and can be somewhat a simulator. It has a very long campaign but Codemasters removed the MP side of the game, wish I could have bought this game to try it out MP. Graphics are niiiice too, absolutely a must have if you're into racing games."
"I really enjoy this game.The driving is fun, and the handling is varied between vehicles and classes. The race modes are a good mix of hectic sideways action (drift events) and precision apex driving (GT1/2). It sits in that happy little place between arcade and simulator.  But it isn't perfect. Here are some things I found damn annoying: Technical Issues: - The pit crew guy that constantly provides updates has a damn annoying voice. Unfortunately you can't turn him off in a useful way. You can reduce the voice volume, but this also means reducing you crew mate/racer who actually says useful things. Also, if you turn down the voice volume, you still get sound dipping of race/engine sounds when he communicates... even though he is muted. Crazy right. - The AI crashes, sometimes the AI will spin out in a corner. Fine, it happens. But, the way it happens is pretty much their car jumps to the side a metre or so and then they lose it. Maybe the hand of God?  Personal Opinion: - Need for Speed: The Run had a totally epic race challenge called 'Porsche Attack' it's a 6 minute point-to-point time trial up a series of hairpins to the top of a mountain, then a fast open hillside into an epic flowing downhill decent. Anyone who has played that level knows what I'm talking about. Grid has nothing like that. Generally the tracks are very flat and don't have much character. There is no feeling, no adrenaline, no 'wow, this is awesome' just clinical &amp; controlled racetracks. It may be enough for some, but I was a little disappointed."
One of the best racing games I've ever played
"if there ever was such an intence, action packed. smoke screen felling and out right real sence of speed on the track then **** me sideways   also the closest thing to a real tf&amp;f game"
"best for just drifting, graphics r great, great controls 8/10"
"Really fun racing game even if you suck at racing games (like I do). It looks fantastic and has a decent amount of cars, customization options, race modes, and tracks. The single player campaign structure keeps you motivated to continue racing and most races and cars never feel the same. 24 Hours of Le Mans races require some serious stamina to continuously compete in but luckily you can skip them if you prefer shorter races. The soundtrack is cool though nothing special. The flashback feature is perfect if you're a racing newbie like me, though I sometimes wish there was an option for unlimited flashbacks. Don't bother playing without a controller, keyboard controls are borderline impossible. I was very surprised that I enjoyed this game as much as I did, as normally I have an aversion to racing games, but this was a great, realistic, approachable, and fun racing game. I'd recommend it to anyone!"
"good game , expecialy le mans really do recomend but far cheeper on Other sites"
"It a great game, my graphic card sucks but its a fun game."
Buy it now. Freakin awesome game. Codemasters always does a great job but this is the yardstick.
I THINK THIS IS A GREAT AND WORTHED RACING GAME. ITS EASY TO PLAY WITH KEYBOARD
Best racing game on the market. From 2008 with love.
"Race Driver GRID or just GRID.. I have played enough of this on PC/PS3 to make a review...  I bought the game way back when it was new for the PS3 and it was the most realistic racer to date. You started by driving for other teams and eventually for your own team. The physics were incredible and graphics were the best at the time. I did enjoy it back then. The online sessions with friends were so fun back then.. But now few years later I bought GRID again for the PC to see if I still enjoy it as much as before. I can honestly say, I really do enjoy GRID even to this date. Now theres all sorts of other racers like Forza Motorsport series, Assetto Corsa, Project CARS....   The game runs really well even on lower end PC's and the wheel support is amazing. Graphics are still enjoyable, and so are the physics. I'd recommend this instead of GRID 2 / GRID Autosport. GRID 2 is more like arcade. And Autosport isn't that great.. They did it right only on GRID '1'. Here's some pros and cons..  PROS: -Decent graphics even to this date. -Variety of racing events (touge, drifting, prototype, formula..) -Brilliant wheel support.  -ALOT of content.  -'Story' is amazing (owning your own team) -Physics and damage modeling is fantastic.   CONS: -Some issues while playing (game would crash sometimes. Maybe every 4th startup?) -Online sessions are gone I believe. (I couldn't connect)"
Beautiful game: perfect graphics and multiplayer. Just one thing: cars are not completely customizable!
Some of the most 'behind-the-wheel' fun to be had on a computer.
"Gr8 Game,  much wow very racing should buy"
"This is what I've been looking for in a racing game. Professional style tracks and the occasional street course. Great cars. Good controls (Using Xbox controller for Windows), graphics are crisp. Love the game."
"Awesome game, Le Mans is in it, what more can one ask for?"
This is a great racing game. It can be quite hard playing with a keyboard though. Perhaps that's just my bad gaming skills....
"Great game, good graphics. If you into racing games you wont be dissapointed."
"Until I discovered Grid - I first played it on PS3 - I'd lost interest in racing games. Gran Turismo had started to feel flat, Need for Speed hadn't impressed me since Most Wanted 2 and despite my brothers both raving about Grid I decided not to bother.  Then one day, for no obvious reason, I decided to give it a go.   Brilliant.  What makes it (and the series in general) appeal to me is the balance between 'sim' and 'arcade'. It's a racing game serious enough to put you in the position of a professional racing driver but not actually expect you to be one. You didn't have to spend hours practicing braking distances, you could slide round corners, hit other cars and see some semblance of damage. It was an accessible game, one that rewarded practice but didn't necessitate it. For me, it put the fun back into racing games without having to move to streetracing.  It helped that the driving itself was wrapped in an excellent career mode. It was a joy developing your racing team, competing in the different disciplines and the dynamic of having a team mate.   With Grid: Autosport around the corner, I'd recommend the original as a cheap way to see if the series is for you. If you're looking for a fun, semi-serious racing game then the Grid games could be perfect."
Great Arcade style racing game. The orange hue can get tiresome at times but it is still fun to play.
"A good bit of fun, when the AI isn't doing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t blatant hacks. Even when your in the superior car, they will always out accelerate, out turn and out brake you on the higher difficulties which makes it rather frustrating when someone gets a 6 second lead in 2 seconds because your behind, and theyre in first so they get to travel at a fraction of C. Its actually impossible to beat the Raven West team on the higher difficulties because of this [they cheat the hardest]. San Francisco is one of the obvious places, where they continue to accelerate on the jumps, where you lose huge amounds of speed, even in the AWD Skyline, the back technical sectrion of Circuit de la Sarthe is another example, even the straight where the slower Aston Martins suddenly have a higher top speed than the faster Murcielago. TL;DR, fun but ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t half the time. 6.5/10"
"Having been raised on the Forza Motorsport series, and kicking xbox to the curb, I have found it difficult to find a game that scratches my racing itch. I am not super technical, but I also hate a complete arcade racers (unless playing mario kart with the kids). This is the best option that I have found on steam for a good realistic/arcade blend. The most important part for me was the AI. I dont feel that it cheats to make it difficult. If fact, it is clear that any failure to win is solely determined by my skill. There is no hand holding. There are no mandatory gimicks. It's sad that the successors to this game are worse than this. I forsee dumping many hours into this game...and for $4 on a sale weekend!"
Didn't expect much when I purchased this game but I have a blast everytime I play it either with friends or solo. I love the drifting aspects of the driving. I don't think I've ever had that much fun drifting in a racing game.
Very Awesome Game. I like the way the opponents make mistakes and cause some pretty astounding variables in this very imersive race bonanze.
"Damn easy even with hard mode. Nice graphics, but too easy gameplay."
"Probably the most underrated racing game out there. Realistic, fun, and addicting"
"Great game. Physics are ok, I for one this the drifting is a little off. To, acrade like. Otherwise a good game."
"Great game, good variety of tracks and cars. Good luck anyone trying a race of over more than an hour though. ♥♥♥♥ that. ♥♥♥♥ing piece of ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing AI side-swiping me 50 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes into a 20 lap race on the ♥♥♥♥-fest that is ♥♥♥♥ing LeMans. ♥♥♥♥ THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME.  Game is good. Buy it."
"If you love cars, if you love rancing, if you love crashing, if you love FUN, then get this game.  The graphics, even though this is a 2008/7 game, are amazing. High detail on each model, inclunding interiors!  Gameplay is fun as hell, with soft body parts physics that make you finish a race with a totally destroyed car. Crashes are fun as hell, so even if you can't win, you can put on a good show.  Races are also good, from touring car championships, to drifting and japanese Initial-D style racing. Open wheeled, touring cars, Le Mans, you name it!  This is the perfect racing game."
get it it is fantastish
best racing game ever 10/10
Might be old now but it still looks good and is a fun game! Just remember playing multiplayer is kinda hard since they removed the multiplayer feature recently so you will need to download a seperate client for that to work!
One of the best racers ever.
"It's like... racing, yo. Only you drive a time machine with only a limited number of gigawatts. Yeah, thats cool."
"Great for any racing fans. I would like modification options, but other than that it's a solid racer."
"This game is 7 years old but is still great. Pretty good balance of realism and arcade. 8/10 for me, the 24hr Lemanns wasn't really my thing. Seems like since the save data is local, if you reinstall on a different setup you have to start from beginning -_-"
I never got to play the original GRID until now.I own Grid autosport and played GRID 2 and much more newer racing game but non of them is as fun as GRID 1. Pure racing with fun career mode with a nice veraity of racing modes. I feel bad that I didnt got to play it sooner because its still the the best racing game even today.
"Standard simulation racing game in the style of Gran Turismo and Forza. You start out taking racing contracts for other teams before eventually founding your own team. There really isn't much to do with your team other than pick an AI racing partner and choosing color schemes. Other than that you are just making money to buy new cars so you can enter different events, there is nothing else to buy or do. The racing is fun though it is a simulation so you will have to be precise in order to win and some races will take you a number of retries as you may screw up and spin out generally losing the race for you. If you enjoy racing and don't mind staring at the back of the same car for very long periods of time you will enjoy this but be warned the difficulty ramps up significantly halfway through."
"When this GRID first came out in 2007, it has stunned mostly everyone especially in the terms of graphic,sound, and the steering ability due to codemaster first ever used an ECO Engine that really thrive it, So i think it's absolutely stunning !!!  Probably one of the best car racing game ever made.....  Codemaster have just abandoned the online play which is a shame really but apart from this, it's real GEM !!..... (the one you should own ..GRID..) need i say more.  This one game you never get tired of playing !!."
The best looking racing game. NFS? What's that?
This game is a racing experience like no other priced at $15. The large number of tracks and the great graphics make this a must have for any racing fan.
best racing game in ages
Best racing game yet. Almost a perfect balance between simulation and Arcade racing games.
Pretty great game. I really love the mountain racing part of the game personally not very many games actually have that as a feature.
Might be old now but it still looks good and is a fun game! Just remember playing multiplayer is kinda hard since they removed the multiplayer feature recently so you will need to download a seperate client for that to work!
"If you want a racing game, this should be the first one you play. It does more for the genre in one game than most franchises pull off their entire life. The only downside would be the limited maps and lack of customization for your car beyond paint and sponsor stickers. A fun, arcade style race management portion that feels tacked on instead of integrated from the beginning helps make this more than just going fast in circuits."
"Don't like the complicated nitpicky details of sims like Gran Turismo? Just wanna focus on driving, like focusing on finding that perfect curve through a turn? Wanna try your hand at Japanese mountain Tou-ge? How bout driving an Indy Car? Do ya like drifting? Wanna drive real world cars in real world locations instead of fictional ones like in Ridge Racer? This game's GOT IT ALL. Beautiful graphics (you ought to check out the day/night transition while racing in the 24 hr. Le Mans (24 hrs in about 13 minutes that is...)). An impressively slick menu system. This is the polished, 'triple A' game you arcade racers out there were waiting for."
"I'm not really well versed in racing games so I don't feel like I can give this game a fair review, but for the little i've played, I really enjoyed this one!  The Good: +Graphics: They're really, really nice! To say the least, for a game I snagged through Humble Bundle, I wasn't expecting such a smoothe feel to the game and such a nice aesthetic.  +Gameplay: Had to use X360ce to get my logitech contoller to work with it, but once I did, man, the game feels great.  +Easy to get into: I crashed my car like a 100x's before I finally remembered how to play a damn racing game, but that was because of my lack of skill and not how easy it was to just start and play the game.  +Voice Acting: Really smoothe voice acting! I was a bit freaked out at first when they called me by my name...but I remembered the option to choose your nick name, and, yea. Is pretty nice addition  The Bad: -No controller support besides 360: So, the 360 controller is supported standard. Anything else you need to use a workaround like 360ce. Kinda frustrating, but oh well. -Other drivers are ♥♥♥♥♥: Not really a bad, but man, they suck.  -Can't really think of anything else, really.  Overall: Like I said, I don't play these games often so I can't give a fair review. But, it's a fun game and i'll probably be playing more of it inbetween other games."
THE GOOD  + Plenty of racing disciplines and locations  + Accessible and rewarding career mode  + Excellent online lobby system  + Superb graphics and presentation   THE BAD  - Lacking online game types  - No mechanical upgrades for vehicles  - No split-screen multiplayer support  - Sometimes finicky controls  SCORE: 8/10
Before you buy you must know its great game because its by Codemasters Duh! but the multplayer servers have been shutdown.

One of the best racers ever.
This game is tons of fun the only bad thing now is that the online is off. I think it still works on Xbox 360 though. Anyway for 5 bucks you can't go wrong if you're looking for a great single player experience.
great game with contoller support
"This game is pretty sick, especially for $5 on GMG this weekend"
Very Good Graphics...

"Playing DiRT 3 made me realise how good this game is and I'm not just saying that because the game goes 'Hello Jamie, welcome back' when I launch it. The racing itself is a lot more entertaining, well done customisation, a stylish interface that doesn't try too hard, no annoying menu characters, no GFWL, no insisting I stick my replays on youtube and no mass DLC. What I like about both games however is how crashing drastically effects the cars performance and how there is a rewind feature to help out terrible drivers like me."
"Much like DiRT, this game is less about grids and more about lots of cars travelling quickly down the road."
"10/10, worth its weight in gold compared to GRID sequels"
I wish to have proper controller cause on kyboard it's hard to menage racer still i see great potential in it.
Fast and good gameplay...
The best race simulator I've ever seen! Waiting for the second part
One of the best racing games out there! it's not like need for speed at all. you do not drift around every corner and it is a competitive game to play. the graphics are good. the AI is good. The driving is good. Online is good. the game is just overall good. I would say that between the first and second GHrid games this is a little bit better than the second for career mode. But Grid 2 is better for driving and racing. i would recommend the game and i give it an 8/10
"If you're looking for a realistic racing game, this probably isn't the game for you. But if you're looking for a fun racing game with interesitng physics and a variety of cool game modes, a classic arcade art style, this is probably the game you're looking for. The campaign is fun, and has a unique sponsoring system to gain credits. While later on in the game, certain sponsors get OP and you will end up getting more money than you'll ever need to spend, it's a fun mechanic becuase different sponsors will give you different benefits, and keep the game interesting. The sponsors are decals you put on your car before racing, advertising a company, and if you complete their requirements (ie: complete at least 2nd and under 40% damage to your car) they'll offer you something like an extra $20,000 (varies depending on sponsor) on top of your salary for winning. You can have a multitude of sponsors, and depending on how many of them you satisfy, you can make more than double what you would have made from just regularly placing. While this game is old, has successors, the original GRID in my mind is the most superior. It has it's flaws, and there's probably better games out there, but if you're into racing games GRID is a must have."
"A challenging and engaging racing game  The driving in this game is more on the simulator end of the spectrum, although there are some arcade aspects as well (let's say 75% sim, 25% arcade). It never feels bad to be behind the wheel but there's some getting used to in the beginning. The game has a flashback system (limited according to your difficulty level) in case you make some mistakes, and I found the AI somewhat forgiving on Hard, but that might just be me. If you find the right balance of challenge for a race the experience can be quite thrilling.  The game doesn't have a story per se, but you do have a career mode that has you starting from a freelance driver and building and managing your own team (including hiring sponsors and teammates) to conquer championships all around the world. The races are divided into European, American and Japanese leagues, each with its own license points system that keeps you from accessing the top races right away. Depending on your driving skills and your difficulty settings it can be either a moderately long journey or a month's work to beat it.  The car engines are for the most part distinct, although there's not an instantly recogniseable car based on engine sound alone. The sound effects from crases and tire screeching are very well made and the placement is perfect, especially when listening from the inside of the car. In every race your pit engineer keeps you informed of most of the developments around you, both the ones you can see (or participate in) and the ones you don't. Your teammates make comments from time to time as well. I played this a couple of months before writing this and I don't remember if the game's soundtrack is good or not, but I do remember muting it for a better immersion or to play my own and not having any regrets.  The game requires some tweaking to fully enjoy the visuals on PC, like removing the yellowish filter that carried over from the console releases and a few texture upgrades to make the cars really shine. The tracks don't need much improvement and the skyboxes look pretty natural as they are. Regarding the cars, every one has a fully rendered interior (unlike the sequels).   Overall, a very very solid racing game that can perfectly stand up to today's releases, and for the most part outclass them."
Do not buy this game..waste of money. .. quirky and unhandleable with Steering wheels and joysticks.
4 wheels
Great balance between realism and arcade. If only GRID 2 was like this :(
"So cool. Arcadey, but with enough weight to make you feel like you're a good driver.  It's a real shame that we can't buy this game on PC, though. We have to make do with renting it from steam."
"I discovered Grid recently (quite late indeed) since I'm not a hardcore gamer. Being a fan of F1 2010+13 (100% simulation) and Ridge Racer 7 (100% arcade) I was pleased to find that there's something in the middle. I must admit that in the beginning I didn't like the steering/driving feeling, but after a while you get used to it and it's just fine. It's also good that since it's an older game it has lower system requirements than later installments but still it has very nice graphics and sound. The career mode is fine for me as is the simple 'racing day'. All in all it's an entertaining racing game in the middle between sim and arcade, which can be played in older machines, which looks, sounds and plays nice. One more plus is its low price.  The only minus is that there's no split-screen mode...  Recommended!"
"Play this game, because racekar"
i cant even register here in the game or how can i play it online i buy it i have it on steam but i cant start online
One of the best racing games I have played. Arguably one of the most realistic racing sim games.
lots of fun with friends
Very nice racing game.
Really one of the only 'realistic' racing games I can stand. Its fun and the graphics and phyics are amazing.
Certainly the best racing game I've played on PC.
"If you're a fan of racing games and think NFS is too easy / arcady, yet don't want to get too deep into the simulation world this game is for you. It is a good mix of challenge and fun."
"Fantastic racing game. Takes a while to get used to some of the cars, especially the drift cars and events. Extremely well-made racer. Looking forward to Grid 2!"
"This game is too sexy to express in words. It looks awesome, sounds awesome, plays awesome, therefore IS AWESOME."
"Increadible game that is a good inbetween arcade and simulator. Enough of both to appeal to anyone that likes racing games. Controls are very responsibe, graphics and vehicle damage are great for the aged game. It still looks amazing. All around great game that will give you plent yof hours of fun and gameplay without any problems.   Word of warning, multiplayer and online servers went down a while ago so they are no longer available, but the single player career is still more than worth it. My recommendation? Wait until it's on sale to get it. It's still a very good game to get for a good price.   8/10"
One of the best racing sims out there. Definetly recommended.
"A really goodlooking and easy to learn game, that takes the cup like system from Gran Turismo and fuses it with the action from Dirt."
"Having been raised on the Forza Motorsport series, and kicking xbox to the curb, I have found it difficult to find a game that scratches my racing itch. I am not super technical, but I also hate a complete arcade racers (unless playing mario kart with the kids). This is the best option that I have found on steam for a good realistic/arcade blend. The most important part for me was the AI. I dont feel that it cheats to make it difficult. If fact, it is clear that any failure to win is solely determined by my skill. There is no hand holding. There are no mandatory gimicks. It's sad that the successors to this game are worse than this. I forsee dumping many hours into this game...and for $4 on a sale weekend!"
Like Skyrim with cars. 10/10.
"This is by far the best driving game I have ever played, it completely nails the line between simulation and arcade. I am absolutely addicted to the career mode, even we the limited car and track selection. A must play."
its a fun game but it dont seems like it has working srvers :/
This is still one of the greatest racing games out there. Definitely would recommend this to anyone who loves racing games!
"Great game, very solid mechanics, good graphics that run on a very minimalistic system, good progression system and great AI. The AI makes it really fun to play without being rubberbandish. It also has real cars and tracks. It can be hard to see the corners sometimes when you go very fast, especially on the Lemans track. Talking about Lemans, it's too much. I understand that you race Lemans after each season, but I feel like I'm doing that race after every 2 or 3 tournaments and it gets a bit boring. Amazing game overall, I can really reccomend it."
"Grid will challange you in the beginning. Your first drift you will restart probably fifty times. But once you get it, it will be hard not to fall in love with GRID.  10/10, my favorite racing game on PC."
It might just be the best racing game I've played on my PC
"get ready for 20+ restarts per race, as you get tanked, sideswiped, and dipped by the npc drivers. Its a fun game, and beats the heck outa NFS since you cant bounce off walls to make turns and GAIN speed doing it. BUT crap happens on those tracks that should throw caution flags, or halts......and drivers should be disqualified at times, and if it were real to racing, they would. but not in here. you hit a barrier at 70kph, your done! npc hits one at same, and rolls right back on track, back in the race. ill have to thumbs up the game though, im stubborn, and addicted to it. GRID 2 is a good deal nicer though, spend your cash on GRID 2 if you want to invest in the grid series at all."
Absolutely Tops 93/100
Short Seasons = Push Rep and Money harder
its a good racing game and i enjoyed playing it
Great arcade driving game.  The handling in this game is fantastic. Every turn I make feels responsive and tight. The driving is a perfect example of easy to understand hard to master.
"TL;DR - Fantastic game, great gameplay and AI, but can be a major pain in the glutaeus when using a keyboard  GRID is a diverse motorsport/racing game. While the graphics aren't that spectacular, the gameplay is well worth the price. This game has been overlooked by many who play Forza and Gran Turismo, but GRID surpasses the previous two in many respects.  Gameplay: The gameplay is solid. The physics are fairly realistic, the vehicles behave like you would expect, and the AI is much more natural than other games. They often quarrel among themselves, sometimes getting into large accidents and spinning off the track. The 24 Hours of Le Mans is a fantastic race, and I'm surprised not many other games contain it. The game plays fantastically on a controller, but is a major pain in the glutaeus if you have only a keyboard. I haven't been able to test out a steering wheel yet, but I heard it plays even better than a controller. The damage system is well implemented. Hitting a wall at an angle will damage your wheel, suspension, steering, possibly the engine, depending on your speed. With a damaged steering, your car will pull to the side, sometimes to the point where you have to quit the race.  Vehicles: GRID has a large selection of vehicles to choose from. Between tail-happy classic muscle cars, Touring cars, high-performance supercars, purpose-built drift machines, and many other categories, there is a car for every type of racer.  Tracks: I haven't gotten extremely far into the game yet, but of what I've seen, the track selection is fairly large. You have Yokohama, the Le Mans circuit, Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, a track in san Fransisco, a Michigan demolition derby track, and a host of other tracks.  Race types: Good variety in GRID. Your average circuits are to be expected, but GRID also includes downhill drifting, freestyle drift, touge/midnight touge racing, demolition derbies, open-wheel racing, GT championships, and my favorite of all, the 24 Hours of Le Mans.  Graphics: I haven't been able to test it fully, since my computer is as advanced as a toaster, but the graphics in full are nothing too special by default, but if you modify one of the files, you can enable much better graphics.  Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone wanting a different racing game and has a computer more advanced than a 2006 toaster."
the most fun tarmac racing game
you can set it so that the 24 hours of le mans actually takes you 24 hours to beat
"This game is so realistic, I had to scratch my nuts really bad and I ended up crashing."
the best pc racing game i've played even just grabbing it in 2014. best 3 bucks spent on steam in a long time buy it during the sale 15's a little much
I suck at this so bad...
One of best racing games ever !!!
"Grid is amazing, I played it in xbox360 in 2008 and now I play in PC, graphics are stunnig and control is insane, difficult and realistic."
"Great game. Physics are ok, I for one this the drifting is a little off. To, acrade like. Otherwise a good game."
"good game , expecialy le mans really do recomend but far cheeper on Other sites"
One of the best racing games I've ever played
Probably worth the buy now its cheap! fun game!
"Car damage system, flashback and demolition game mode are amazing features of this epic racing game. I also like the graphics and how smooth it plays. "
Great game played it for hours and still love it
This game is still amazing after all these years and it still looks good!
get it it is fantastish
"Main menu track... You must listen to it. And for such an old game, graphics are amazing, it's very enviromental, it sucks you into the game!"
"Drifting is fun.... i got 22,000,000 points once with a 45x combo  Best Grid game so far.... Miles better then Grid 2"
This is still one of the greatest racing games out there. Definitely would recommend this to anyone who loves racing games!
"Cool game, surprised by how good it was even if it is from 2008. Reccomended to try."
"Not a simulator nor full blown arcade. I love it, it is fun, looks great and is overall pretty good, though the campaign isnt that long"
going fast
One of my personal Favourite racing games I have played reminds me of the old school Toca Racing games that I played on Playstation. The way the cars handle on a keyboard is not so good tho so I would sugest you use a gamepad when playing this title other than that if your in to racing games I would say pick it up if you see it on sale!
"Good game, campaign is ruined by random Club GT races though, would have been much better to seperate the classes into their own comps that way people dont have to suffer through racing with boring cars that handle like complete ♥♥♥♥ if they dont want to."
This game is the highlight of my library atm. I truly believe it's the best racing game I've ever played.   It has some suberb features that make it really authentic for the racing scene. Every car you own actually has milage and you can watch it ticking up as you're blazing down the track. You can even buy used cars from 'Ebay'. The AI is fantastic. This may be the first racing game where I've seen cpu drivers actually spin out of the curve and crash. Physics are amazing! My very first race I hit a bump and went flying upside down through the air. There is realistic damage in the game but you can use a short flashback to fix your mistake. These are very limited and short and not game-breaking at all.  The campaign is style is very nice letting you pick different regions to play in and purchase whichever eligible cars you want to compete in.   The longer the game goes the better gets as you unlock and choose your own sponsors on your car all with bonus objectives you can pick for extra cash as well as having YOUR OWN TEAM! You actually get to hire drivers as teammates to back you up in the race. Each with their own personality and driving style. The game plays as tournament style combining you and your team-mate's scores at the end of each race to give you your point standing.   Shake-and-Bake all the way with GRID
"Crazy arcade racing on closed courses with intense crashes and epic drifts. If realism is what you're looking for, avoid this game like the plague, but if you are looking for a fast-paced arcade racer then look no further. Best crash physics I know of, and the damage modeling is almost on Burnout-levels."
Yo do any1 no if u can get a d turbo in this? any chet kods 4 it or sumfin?? My m8 robert sez he threw his controler at his mum and it mised her and shamshed off the door but it hitf buttons and typd in a coad and it turnd al the ♥♥♥♥ cars into ones tht u c arond my hood like voxholl astraz and pugoes 206 and 207 but he tried 2 rember the code 2 no luck.... so i askin u 4 help...

great driving game but controls good be better.
the most fun tarmac racing game
I was racing A car t-boned me That car kept driving I rammed into the air I spun around I barreled rolled I spun around in dirt for 10 seconds I got last place. 10/10 Would Rage Again
Really enjoying it!
"Nice, but old game!"
Played the game for 5hours and I already fell in love with it. The game is beginner (and pro) friendly. The cars feel realistic and clean. The sound is spot on and there are a ♥♥♥♥ ton of races. Its another good game from codemasters.  1 con no multiplayer :'(  easy 9/10 (diden't get 10 because of multiplayer missing)
favorite racing game to come back to. Pairs magnificiently with Dirt 2. I have yet to try the F1 games
"Fun game, great driving experience. Seems boring after a while as the races are easy. Maybe there's a difficutly option in there I just haven't checked it."
"Excellent racing title, huge number of tracks and great semi-simulation arcade gameplay."
First impression: it looks like someone has urinated on my screen. Evidently this game was subject to the god awful trend of fugly post-filters that a lot of arcade racers had.
"I am not a motorsport games fan at all, I don't need simulation in my gaming life at all, but I've played several racing games, and haven't had so much fun with them since Colin McRae 3 and 4 until I launched GRID. There's no rush in the game, there some kind of a wannabe storyline, and guidance, but otherwise you simply play what you want, the races you want and there's enough challenge and motivation in there for you to want to finish first and earn money to buy new cars and advance but not too much to get frustrated. I love this game. I like the customization options, the fact that you can create and name and manage your own team, it's a nice bonus. and of course, despite the age of this game, it looks absolutely brilliant! Big part of my satisfaction with this game is how great it looks. Definitely recommended!"
"10/10  Still my favorite racing game after many, many years, The game is not a simulation, like forza and not an arcade, like need for speed where you can ram ino a wall with your zonda R and come out clean. It is defenetly balanced more towards simulation though. Defenetly a harder game for the beginers no fancy assists, just the TCS, STM and ABS, although the AI is real easy and is great for learing with. Playing in 'serious' and 'savage' sorta makes it more fun, and because of the damage system, you can't use the car in front of you as a brake and makes the game a little more competitive, compared to the basic, where the AI's brake real, real early. Physics engine is spot on and efficent and the graphics, when turned to MAX, are up to par with today's racing games"
This is by far the best driving game for the pc. And there's drift.
Awesome game! The best ever from Codemasters!
Definitely the best racing game on Steam!
Dis game is coo' if u like racin games u should play dis game.
"Grid although now a few years old is one of those rare games that really does stand up against the tied of time, even now it is a beautiful looking game with some really good detail touches. The car models are really nice and the damage model convincing.  It holds up as a very challenging game which keeps you gripped and on the edge of your seat.  Those who comment on poor handling clearly need to learn how to break before corners and think like a real racer.  I loved this game on xbox 360 and enjoyed many hours online, playing it on pc means I can enjoy the way it really was intended to look, and that is stunning.  My only gripe really is with Codemasters shutting off the servers and not patching the game to allow people to run their own servers, so no online play. Saying that there are methods of still playing it online by using 3rd party apps, however I have found them to be a bit hit and miss, sometimes resulting in a good connection with other players, but then the connection randomly dropping for no reason. Real shame.  Still single player is fun and very challenging, if your a petrol head and don`t mind just playing single player, or want to try the alternate methods of playing online I recommend this game. To be honest I prefer this original Grid to the sequel, which in my opinion lost some of its spark and challenge, not to mention the loss of the Destruction Derby part which was always hugely popular (shame on you Codemasters)."
Closest thing to Forza I've found on the PC... and thats a good thing!
This game is freakin awesome. I can't wait till part 2 goes on sale again.
I recommend you DON'T buy this game.
great game. immersive. imho the one of top 10 best racing game there is out there
"This is a great racing game and i definetly read reviews before buying it. To the negative comments while i do not use a racing wheel, the horrible car controls can be easily adjusted in the options menu. Trust me this game is worth every penny!"
"One of the best and most precise racing simulations I have ever played so far. A game I had fun with on console for endless hours, even although I hate racing games. A gem."
Call of Racing :(
Top notch optimization also Better than Grid 2 And Autosport
pretty neat.
"Excellent racing game but when you get higher in rankings, the courses just get repetitive, mirrored, reversed. Then you realized, there’s only approximately 10 tracks in this game."
"I still play this today, keep coming back to it. Few other games capture the essence of starting with nothing and working your way up to create something. Races are exciting and visceral. And it still looks great.   Shame the rest of the series gave you free cars, etc. This is the pinnacle of the series, went backwards from here in my opinion."
"Grid is a fun game i have way more than only 1.1 hours on there im not sure why it walnt update. But thats a minor problem.  This game is a bridge of the gap thats between the all out mayhem racing of need for speed, and the track racing from somthing like grand torismo or forza motorsports. And i have to say its fun more so than i expected and for the age of this game is still looks amazing though you have to go through a config file to get it to run 1080p but its worth the small hassle.  the racing itself reminds me of need for speed the way the cars handle and stuff but they are just on a track all the time while nfs only has track event some of the time  overall a great game for when i got it at the summer sale for a whole dollar totally worth"
"I just had to come back and write this review; because eight years later after release, this game still holds up. (Don't mind what it says about my playtime, I have more hours on console)  Story: You play as a racer that is trying to build up your reputition to start your own racing-team (which you can fully customize wíth sponsors and various other options). To do so, you must first earn some cash by racing for other existing big-name-teams.  Gameplay: The racing is very aggressive and realistic at the same time. NPC's can actually crash themselves and cause accidents on track. It's not your typical arcade-racer but it's not your typical racing-simulator either. Instead, the racing-mechanics are like a hybrid between those two. (It's made for people that just want to relax with a 'simulator' without the need to worry about those overly complex mechanics that simulators have).  Cons: Because it's an old game, it's needs some fixing before you can play it with your modern setup. For me, I had to into the game files and edit a restriciton to be able to play at 1080p. Link: &gt;  https://joshmccarty.com/2013/08/enable-higher-resolutions-for-grid-on-pc/  &lt;. Other than that there aren't really many cons.  Summary: A very realistic racing experience overall for players that doesn't want to get too technical. (It can also run pretty well on weaker computers/laptops)."
Got into a car  Got to 1st place  Crashed into a Wall  Broke my tire  Finished 12th out of 12.  In this game 10/10 people will experience this also.  
The amount of times it'll take you to restart race until you learn how to properly drive is what makes this game the best.    Also best 3 USD I ever wasted.
"One of the best racing games that i ever played ,, huh, i think it is the best actually."
Loved this game on 360 so i got it on steam. Not mad about the purchase. Looks and plays better than most current racers.
"Simple racing game, just like many others. As usual, most American cars drive like boats and hardly have any breaks. The game is called Grid, but there's no qualification; your place on the grid is random. Everyone including your team mate is almost always ahead of you at the start of the race. Races are pretty easy to win, even on a higher difficulty setting. I'd recommend this game to kids up to twelve year old."
"If you are looking for a Racing / Simulation / 'Restart Race' car game, you should definetly give a try to GRID. Even if it's been released in mid 2008, the graphics are very good, and you don't need to have a SpaceRocket-Computer to run this game. It's fun, challenging, and beautifull.  Gentle reminder : Works well on Win XP, Vista, 7, 8.1 It may not work well for Win 10."
"This game is aged very well My first play time was 7 years ago, at that time I'm using dual core AMD4400+/Celeron E1200 + HD 4670 + 2GB RAM, those machines was great gaming champ back then (and probably still ok playing most of these steam games) Game ran great, even though I can't max the setting, the graphic was amazing.  Now I have better rig, still not the best at least more powerful than my older rig, I can max everything, running so smooth with 60fps  everytime someone mention a racing game on their consoles and bragging about graphic quality on 2015? I just baffled and link them a youtube video.  I mean cmon, this game was released on 2008, and it still comparable with racing game nowdays. and since my disk is missing somewhere, spending $2 again for a game that I love will not kill me.  it's $2 on sale you can get GRID, GRID 2, and GRID Autosport and it still less expensive than Forsa/Grand Tourismo/Need For Speed (if consoles is your thing)"
"This is my favorite racing game. The graphics are beautiful and not cartoony. I run this game at max settings for everything and it runs really good. Only LAN available now but, single player mode is incredibly fun. The price now is amazing. I paid full price for it when it first came out and it was worth it. Took a little bit to get used to the handling of the cars but once I did was alot of fun."
"GOOD OLD GAME BUT TOO LIMITED. I RECOMMEND OTHER OPTIONS.  Pros. - Realistic physics and damage (can mess you pretty bad if your arent carfeul). - Many events from different classes, courses and car disciplines. - Solid driving for the most part.  Cons. - Unfair AI for higher difficulties. - Almost no learning curve for the cars, no drifting tutorials or hints (see explanation below) - Poor drifting control. - No tunning. - Very limited customization. - Not too many cars.  Not bad for the price but its not great either. This is like a neutral review for what it ends to be another average racing game to me. I think I set my expectations too high by the good reviews. If you wanna see how different racers were back in the early 2000's get this cheap but to be honest I recommend you get a more modern and better polished games like GRID 2. The Flashback (Rewind System) is much better there and more useful. The drifting system is MUCH better there, or even in Need For Speed Games. This one has it too difficult to do and withouth any tutorials for doing it of any kind, the drifting events are unplayable. The seasons system in the carreer mode has this thing that prompts you to race in the Le Mans track after every 4 or 5 events you raced. You can skip it but it gets annoying fast. The AI seems to outspeed on higher difficulties very easily even when using the same cars, so without tunning there isnt much you can do.  The game has plenty of car disciplines though but they are still limited in what you can do with them withouth tunning or tweaking the performance of the cars. Maybe it was amazing when it came out but I don't think it holds up that well today and even older racing games have more options and customization. I didnt give the thumbs down because it was cheap at least and its pretty old anyways."
If you love racing of all types this game is for you. You can race any style you want in Race Day or go for getting a team together for wripping out the the other teams. To become the highest points driver. THIS STEAM VERSION GAME RUNS ON WINDOWS 10.
Great Arcade style racing game. The orange hue can get tiresome at times but it is still fun to play.
Great racing game!
not even a single bat
"Great game and it fits all levels of skills. The le Mans part gets boring after a while and the whole game gets a little trivial after 6 or 7 seasons because then its all about reputation farming. But that aside, the graphics are great and the feeling you have with the cars even just with the keyboard is amazing. Great game  7/10"
"Really satisfying game mechanics and feel. Drift events are awesome although I wish there were more cars in the game. Still, it took about 20 hours to beat and has decent replayability. It's not overly difficult to run and looks good. Use a controller or wheel. If it goes on sale I'd definately reccommend it for a fun arcadey racer that has an authentic feel."
"I generally suck at racing simulators. Yes I do not like to use breaks, and i´m more of an F-Zero/need for speed kind of player. But I really wanted to play a racing game that was easy to handle yet gave me a challenging and rewarding experience. I read some comments saying that this game was a fun mix between arcade and simulator, so I gave it a try.  I was not dissapointed. At first it was difficult for me, because it has some simulation in it. Not used to it. But this was really easy to learn and the physics are well done, not accurate, just fun to learn.  This is a good game for casual players and offers great challenges as well. The progression system is also great and you really feel you´re getting somewhere.  This is one of the most fun racing games I have played recently."
"TL;DR: Great racing game, but the inconsistent difficulty is infuriating. It's a steal when it's on sale so pick it up then anyway  The graphics are decent for its age, tracks and cars are varied enough so it doesn't get boring and the main career has a good length. The driving model feels decent, it's definitely in the arcade range but nowhere near full arcade. The addition of 24-hour Le Mans is a nice idea, but it gets quite boring after a couple seasons so I just ended up skipping it most of the time.  However one thing that literally drives me up the wall is the complete randomness of the difficulty. One race I wreck everything on Savage (2nd highest), next race the AI blatantly cheats even on Normal (2nd lowest) making it near impossible to win. I had to turn it to the lowest difficulty several times and it still was somewhat of a challenge.  Despite that I'd recommend picking it up when it's on sale, it's too cheap to pass up."
Cool but the controls....
"This and forza are my two favorite racing games... hands down. Always play racing games on manual, It makes drifting soooo much better."
Its NOT FORZA but it will do.
That's racing arcade/sim made right. Not overloaded with too much tuning and physics yet competitive gameplay.
"It may be on the older side, but Grid is a fun game. It is a mix between arcade/simulation while trying very hard, and doing well at that to be a simulator. If you like down/up hill Touge events and mountain style drifting (Initial D), this game has those."
"I already have GRID2 and GRID AUTOSPORT bought this just to own the set, was not expecting much owing to it's age but like RACE 07 it has stood the test of time and is very playable.  OK it has not got the eye candy of say Project Cars or Assetto Corsa (both in my collection) but it is still a great driving/racing sim from almost a decade ago great nostalga...."
"There are very few games that can captivate you through their immersiveness. GRID is one of those games, the career mode is excellent, plenty of options to unlock liecenses and new vehicles, 30 hours in the game and I am still not bored, I would highly recommend this game to those who likes the whole arcade experience with amazing graphics, excellent gameplay and plenty of cars to choose from, GRID is a classic and will go down a long way in the histoy. I hope EA learns something from CodeMasters."
"Played that game for the first time on ps3 and got addicted right away.Fun to play,different modes,plenty of cars and tracks.Not too realistic and in my opinion that's what makes it more interesting.Addition of split screen play would have made that game even better as with any racing game,but I still enjoyed playing it.Definitely recommend."
"A good bit of fun, when the AI isn't doing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t blatant hacks. Even when your in the superior car, they will always out accelerate, out turn and out brake you on the higher difficulties which makes it rather frustrating when someone gets a 6 second lead in 2 seconds because your behind, and theyre in first so they get to travel at a fraction of C. Its actually impossible to beat the Raven West team on the higher difficulties because of this [they cheat the hardest]. San Francisco is one of the obvious places, where they continue to accelerate on the jumps, where you lose huge amounds of speed, even in the AWD Skyline, the back technical sectrion of Circuit de la Sarthe is another example, even the straight where the slower Aston Martins suddenly have a higher top speed than the faster Murcielago. TL;DR, fun but ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t half the time. 6.5/10"
"Grid is to asphalt racing wjhat Dirt 2 is to dirt track/rally racing. The two games are very similar and appear to run on the same base engine. Grid has just the right balance of arcade and real world physics to make the game difficult but not frustrating, making races fun time and again. I particularly like the 'Flashback' feature (also featured in Dirt 2), allowing you to use instant replay to teleport back a few seconds in time and retry a botched turn or avoid a crash. I use the feature sparingly bc sometimes it feels like cheating, but it can also be the difference between a race being fun and being maddening.  Pick it up on sale, GRID is a fantastic game! It's especially fun and CHALLENGING with a steering wheel and pedals accessory, but (xBox 360) controller and keyboard controls work well too."
Best drifting game!  Fantastic graphics.
Verry fun ! best racing game yet
Good game nice graphics . I just wished the game didnt have opening buggs as mine seems to have .
"The Drifting is respectfully accurate to real life drifting, it feels like drifting in snow. the best racing game played so far."
A racing game with damage! The car dynamics aren’t as accurate as maybe a gran turismo but they are pretty good. Some of the tracks are really challenging.
"One of the better racing games I've played. Good graphics, gameplay, game mechanics and physics. On a side note: this is the first racing game I've ever taken to the multiplayer step."
"This game is the best Arcade-Simulaton racing game you'll ever play, the handling of the cars is SUPERB and even if the game can be considered old, the graphics are still GREAT !   Must buy for any racing fan out there.  PS: i only have a few hours played on steam because i had the non-steam version of the game :)"
"Great simcade racer. It's really lacking in car customization and events but is a fun pick-up-and-play racing game. I'm a huge fan of Initial D, and the touge races are really freakin' cool. Drifting is also one of my favourite aspects in this game. A little too easy though."
"Great game so much fun and is soo well optimised. runs smooth while looking good. Grid, Grid 2 and grid autosports are the best racing sim games hands down."
"ONLINE SERVICE HAS BEEN SUSPENDED. It's still playable through hamachi, but just so you know."
"Arcade and Simulation 6:3 or 7:3...? :) but racing game content is very good... specially, touge race, street circuit... i like it.  p.s Doesn't work online... :( server is dead...??"
One of the best for PC racing. Graphics are good for an '08 game and no stupid rubber banding or insanely hard AIs
I'd probably be in debt of 9billion dollars by now. 
fun game but only the resolution is small
0/10 not enough boobs
"helmet view --&gt; check No prevention of wheel lock --&gt; check No prevention of understeer --&gt; check Realistic crash mechanism --&gt; check  Readied my crash dummy helmet, as I have just created major race crash in yet another race. Now I know why I am not a racing driver in real life."
"This game, along with Need for Speed SHIFT, defined a perfect racing game for me. Total scalability made it fun, engaging or demanding — something different for every type of player. The amount of events and races altogether with tracks length gave us enough hours to fully enjoy it. Today GRID can seem outdated in terms of graphics but never stopped to excel in playability area. Still worth trying, and now it’s really cheap! 8/10"
This game is pretty awesome for the fact that you can hire useless expensive Italian driver baby.  Like all Italian things he's got a funny accent. Other than that the driving is pretty fun. Probably my favorite codemaster driving.
Great racing game!
"If you're a fan of racing games and think NFS is too easy / arcady, yet don't want to get too deep into the simulation world this game is for you. It is a good mix of challenge and fun."
Really one of the only 'realistic' racing games I can stand. Its fun and the graphics and phyics are amazing.
Certainly the best racing game I've played on PC.
"Cool game, surprised by how good it was even if it is from 2008. Reccomended to try."
"Not a simulator nor full blown arcade. I love it, it is fun, looks great and is overall pretty good, though the campaign isnt that long"
if you love fast cars nice drifts and a bit of le mans then this is the game too play =)
"Crazy arcade racing on closed courses with intense crashes and epic drifts. If realism is what you're looking for, avoid this game like the plague, but if you are looking for a fast-paced arcade racer then look no further. Best crash physics I know of, and the damage modeling is almost on Burnout-levels."
This game is the highlight of my library atm. I truly believe it's the best racing game I've ever played.   It has some suberb features that make it really authentic for the racing scene. Every car you own actually has milage and you can watch it ticking up as you're blazing down the track. You can even buy used cars from 'Ebay'. The AI is fantastic. This may be the first racing game where I've seen cpu drivers actually spin out of the curve and crash. Physics are amazing! My very first race I hit a bump and went flying upside down through the air. There is realistic damage in the game but you can use a short flashback to fix your mistake. These are very limited and short and not game-breaking at all.  The campaign is style is very nice letting you pick different regions to play in and purchase whichever eligible cars you want to compete in.   The longer the game goes the better gets as you unlock and choose your own sponsors on your car all with bonus objectives you can pick for extra cash as well as having YOUR OWN TEAM! You actually get to hire drivers as teammates to back you up in the race. Each with their own personality and driving style. The game plays as tournament style combining you and your team-mate's scores at the end of each race to give you your point standing.   Shake-and-Bake all the way with GRID
Highly addictive! Great graphics and can rebind gamepad buttons.
"Good game, #sexy_wheels lol stuff happens and you race the carzzzzzz!"
iMo... the best arcade...simulationwhatever racer on the PC! D&lt; I love this Game!
This is the raceing game who said you want realistic raceing that is fare all around good graphics good gameplay for the first time.Try to beat it live it cause it's raceing.
"Great game, still have lots of fun on this one."
"Racedriver GRID. Not really much to say here apart from that its the best racing game I've seen in many years. Graphics, Cars, replayability, its all in there and what's even better than all that combined? The 'retry' system. Never again will you have to restart an entire race based on one little mistake... Now you just hit the replay mid-race hit a button and wham, you can retry that mistake you just made.  Of course that changes with the Difficulty and hardcore arcade racers will have a pretty harsh time making their raceline work for them. Apart from that, casuals will have their work cut out also, making this, apart from DiRt 2, the best arcade race on steam right now.   Graphics are fresh, clear and detailed enough to make it a believable experience. However, most tracks are simuluar but not exact replica's of real world circuits and most of the time, a variation of one track (multiple route ones). Worth it? Very Yes!  4 / 5"
Buy this so codemasters will notice and make a sequel instead of more stupid ♥♥♥♥ing dirt and f1 games.
not quite sim and harder than arcade...awesome racing game.  Too bad Codemasters can't beassed releasing the DLC for PC...no Bathurst for GRID!
"GRID is a greate racing simulator for PC. Great graphics, sound, nice cars, good physics, and very challenging. The only downside I can think of is that the keyboard might be a little difficult to play on. I love playing on manual transmission and the controller really allows you to down and up shift with ease while being able drift simultaneously."
"Very well made racing game. Lots of cars to choose from, lots of tracks, and a nice variety of modes to play."
One of the best racing games I have ever played. Extremely realistic with design and control.
"The game looks good but not really played it yet as I am trying to get full screen, All i have is a small screen in the middle of monitor and a dirty great big black border so caqn really get into the game."
The most fun I had was doing the night mountain races with Initial D Mega-Mix playing as loud as possible.
Do not buy this game..waste of money. .. quirky and unhandleable with Steering wheels and joysticks.
"10/10, worth its weight in gold compared to GRID sequels"
"The legendary game that revolutionized sim-arcade racing, this is really a fun and cool game for every car fan. Games modes go from european 24hour lemans, japanese canyon drifts and american muscle derby. The crashing detail is crazy, but pretty much like any racer the end just seems punishing with 5lap races on long tracks."
"BUY THIS NOT GRID 2  Hello there fellow steam users, first I would like to say that this is a great game. I don't usually like these types of games but this one is very nice.  The problems with 'GRID 2' which are amazing in 'GRID'  1. Not the same physics so you can't do the things you can in this game (like make the other cars crash by ramming them)  2. GRID 2 tells you 'there is damage to your car', this game tells you where (which wheel, transmition, engine, etc) and how much.  3. GRID 2 feels really linear, this one gives you a bunch of options on where and how you want to race.  DONT BUY GRID 2, BUY GRID 1 FOR MUCH LESS   and hopefully the creators will pick up that they started to head down the wrong road. (get it, it's a driving pun ;] )"
Closest thing to Forza I've found on the PC... and thats a good thing!
"Solid racing game, physics were spot on however the game lacked a good story"
Definitely the best racing game on Steam!
"Got 100% completion on the hardest difficulty, and I really enjoyed the game overall, Graphics, storyline, gameplay, physics, everything...another job well done by Codemasters"
The game is as fun as it is difficult.
The best game =] Summer Camp Tickets!!!
not quite sim and harder than arcade...awesome racing game.  Too bad Codemasters can't beassed releasing the DLC for PC...no Bathurst for GRID!
"This is a great racing game and i definetly read reviews before buying it. To the negative comments while i do not use a racing wheel, the horrible car controls can be easily adjusted in the options menu. Trust me this game is worth every penny!"
"Probably the most balanced sym/arcade hybrid ever released, words can't tell how satisfying this game is, beating a tough race on a higher difficulty, last lap, no flashbacks left, car is still able to maintain a straight line... Just WOW! Fantastic game."
Great game! One of the best racing games that I have played. On to Grid 2 now!
Fun racing game with good graphics
Buy this so codemasters will notice and make a sequel instead of more stupid ♥♥♥♥ing dirt and f1 games.
Awesome game. If your looking for hardcore racing sim then this may not be your cup of tea. I do enjoy this game just wish my steering wheel would work much better.
"If you like racing and you like pretend internet points, you are going to LOVE Grid. Seriously. Buy it, it's so damn fun and the second one is coming out soon!"
awsome game way better than forza and gt
"I live my life a quarter mile at a time, during those 10 seconds or less, I'm free. Nothing else matters, not the mortgage, not the house, not the team and all of their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This game, gives a small moment of thrill and makes me feel weird inside. I also wish the AE86 could be used in more races."
"Smooth and fluid, fast paced and challenging. Perhaps not the most accurate racing simulation out there, but certainly a must-have for any racing sim fan. A great selection of vehicles to choose from, great AI programming, and hosting some of the world's top asphalt tracks makes this game a need."

"Lots of tracks and cool cars, and great graphics for its time."
great driving game but controls good be better.
the most fun tarmac racing game
I was racing A car t-boned me That car kept driving I rammed into the air I spun around I barreled rolled I spun around in dirt for 10 seconds I got last place. 10/10 Would Rage Again
"I had some extra cash. looked in the under 6$ section, saw this. said 'Meh, It'll do.' aND I DIDNT EXPEXT TO BE GETTING SUCH A GOOD GAME ITS FROM 2007 BUT ITS STILL AMAZING"
Short Seasons = Push Rep and Money harder
Great arcade driving game.  The handling in this game is fantastic. Every turn I make feels responsive and tight. The driving is a perfect example of easy to understand hard to master.
Race. Crash. Restart.
"get ready for 20+ restarts per race, as you get tanked, sideswiped, and dipped by the npc drivers. Its a fun game, and beats the heck outa NFS since you cant bounce off walls to make turns and GAIN speed doing it. BUT crap happens on those tracks that should throw caution flags, or halts......and drivers should be disqualified at times, and if it were real to racing, they would. but not in here. you hit a barrier at 70kph, your done! npc hits one at same, and rolls right back on track, back in the race. ill have to thumbs up the game though, im stubborn, and addicted to it. GRID 2 is a good deal nicer though, spend your cash on GRID 2 if you want to invest in the grid series at all."
I recommend you DON'T buy this game.
This is a good racing game and I played it a lot.
This game is really good but it makes you rage a lot.
One of the best Racing games I have played!
"Game is RACE....probably better then the last NFS games... the auto cheats for the game can keep you going round and round, but there is no direction how to save your car and paint and money unless you go to options and driver and save driver option...just tried it saved to overwrite what was previously saved..so going back to check it out if that worked or not REALL BLOWS for the game just to not save for you BUT IT DOESNT unless the saving driver works will let ya know..GOLDEN DRAGON.."
"One of the most over looked driver games, I have to say it is better than NFS, I could highly recomend this game to anyones gaming colection! I get in a mood that I don't want to get in to a long drawn out mission but want the trill of fast paced racing around with A++ graphics and destructable enviorment, the cars take damage too, lke bent rims, crushed in fenders that hinder stearing just to name a few! Crashes are pretty cool to, like after a flip over the car most likly will need to be restarted. Demolistion mode is about the most fun screwing around race, but be warned the computer is very aggresive even in easy mode!"
"This game is a trip. I purchased it during the Winter Sale and it's quite fun. You can bump the difficulty down if you don't want too big of a challenge. Some times, I just want to run around and not worry too much about losing or winning. The Demolition Derby is fun but gets repetitive since there's only 2 tracks (At least that I've seen so far). It's still really fun."
One of the best racing games I have ever played. Extremely realistic with design and control.
"Aesthetically pleasing game and the car damage is pretty awesome. However, the game devs on this one can eat my ♥♥♥. Not a terrible game but not a good game in the genre."
One of the best arcadish racing games.  Feels way better than GRID2 does.  Multiplayer works good as well.
"If you have any doubt about buying this game,don't think,buy it it worths each cent."
With a great confidence I can tell... This is the BEST racing game I've ever played! ^.^  I give it a 9/10.
although getting old this game still is one of the best racing games of all times for both visuals and gameplay
"This game may be older but it is still a great game. Plays well on my A10 apu - on a three screen eyefinity array, G27 wheel (little tricky to configure but there is a way). Put 240 hrs on this game and it plays flawlessly."
"I have to recommend this game - because somehow, without knowing it, I blew more than 90 hours playing it. I don't know how this happened, I'm not a fan of racing games, but this one somehow got under my skin. Well played, Codemasters. You win this round."
"I am by no means an expert on racing sims, or even arcade racing games for that matter. However, after playing a small amount of both Sims and Arcade style racers, I find the balance between the two in this game.  The thing that I really like about this game is that the right balance of that arcade and sim just work wonders for me, even with arcade like settings you can easily oversteer and land yourself in the grass next to the track, almost surely dooming you to lose the race.  It's not a game for those who like Need for Speed's customization, but there is a little paint modification available here. This game has a pretty wide variety of races, though they could have had more tracks. One of my favorites being the Midnight Togue. The number of cars is no where near say Gran Turismo, but it has a decent amount.  All in all, this is probably one of the best racing games I've ever played, and definitely worth the reasonable price."
"This is a terrific racing game, gives the player a lot of different options. I mean if you can find another game that has anything from Demolition Derby Racing, to Drift Races, to Muscle, Tuner, and Formula races. Tell me about that game I'll have to try it after this one. I would give this game an 8/10 just because they give you specific cars you can choose from each race but definitely still fun and addicting nonetheless. Oh, and also the ability to customize your team with the branding, what sponsors it has, and the teammates to choose from give this game an added benefit towards its score for me. Well hopefully this was informative enough, and I hope it gave you insight into what your getting into if you buy this amazing racing game."
Grid is one of the best driving games ever made. the graphics and mechanics still stand up to modern games 6 years after it was released.
Team Ravenwest may seem hard to beat but just remember that their cars fly into the stands just like any other team if you ram them hard enough.
"Ok David, you're car is hit but its nothing serious... leaking cooling system... GG .. BOOM!!!!!111!1!!!1!!!!!1"
"Good driving mechanics, races aren't a pushover, and the AI knows what it is doing. The man on the radio can give you misleading information, but overall, I'd play this over most NFS games."
the grass is ice haha
"DONT BUY IT ITS A PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥, YOU GO ♥♥♥♥ING EVERYWHERE. HOW THE HELL DOES ANYONE EVEN CONTROL THIS,   DO YOU LIKE LOSING? HOW ABOUT GRINDING OFF YOUR ENTIRE PAINTJOB ON WALLS BY THE END OF THE RACE? IF YOU LIKE THIS, THEN YOU SHOULD TRY GRID, ITS ONLY FOR THE MOST PROFESSIONAL DRIVERS WHO ARE USED TO HAVING ICE CUBES AS WHEELS SLIDING AROUND A ♥♥♥♥ING HOCKEY RINK AT 200 MILES AN HOUR  A+"
"I am a bit late to the party with this game, but it is a truly brilliant arcade-style racer (well, maybe just a little bit more involved than an arcade game). As long as you are not expecting a racing simulator, you should enjoy it."
"I'm not very good at realistic racing games, so this game is frustratingly difficult for me, but still a fun game. Harder to play than Need For Speed: Shift. But not impossible for those like me that can't seem to get the hang of realistic racing games. Still very challenging, but still a good game."
Highly addictive! Great graphics and can rebind gamepad buttons.
"Good game, #sexy_wheels lol stuff happens and you race the carzzzzzz!"
"Defenitely one of the best Racing Games, ever been published. Classic Codemasters Handling and great athmosphere!"
Verry fun ! best racing game yet
"Grid is to asphalt racing wjhat Dirt 2 is to dirt track/rally racing. The two games are very similar and appear to run on the same base engine.

It's especially fun and CHALLENGING with a steering wheel and pedals accessory, but (xBox 360) controller and keyboard controls work well too."
"Less track variety than a one-armed junkie, but still very rewarding and a solid racing game."
good game to play but if you do not exit correctly all of your save files will go currupt. 
"Good game, campaign is ruined by random Club GT races though, would have been much better to seperate the classes into their own comps that way people dont have to suffer through racing with boring cars that handle like complete ♥♥♥♥ if they dont want to."
"Great simcade racer. It's really lacking in car customization and events but is a fun pick-up-and-play racing game. I'm a huge fan of Initial D, and the touge races are really freakin' cool. Drifting is also one of my favourite aspects in this game. A little too easy though."
Great game. Looks awsome yet not too intensive. Also no gfwl :)
"Good Game. Needs more car moding and tuning, but fun and nice game."
"very well done, very realistic and yet still a fun racing game.  10/10"
Favourite racing game I've ever played. Wish it had some more endurance-ish type races other than Le Mans in the campaign but other than that I can't fault it
I'm not a big racing buff and I struggle with pure sims as I'm not too patitent but I feel this finds a nice middle ground to make it more accesible but not feel like I'm playing a kart game. Flashbacks really help for those derp moments. Really enjoyable.
"I am not a motorsport games fan at all, I don't need simulation in my gaming life at all, but I've played several racing games, and haven't had so much fun with them since Colin McRae 3 and 4 until I launched GRID. There's no rush in the game, there some kind of a wannabe storyline, and guidance, but otherwise you simply play what you want, the races you want and there's enough challenge and motivation in there for you to want to finish first and earn money to buy new cars and advance but not too much to get frustrated. I love this game. I like the customization options, the fact that you can create and name and manage your own team, it's a nice bonus. and of course, despite the age of this game, it looks absolutely brilliant! Big part of my satisfaction with this game is how great it looks. Definitely recommended!"
"Absolute classic now, i recommend buying this game wholeheartedly, if you're even remotely interested in racing.  Not a sim, not arcadey either, Grid is a satisfying mix of the two. The cars handle very nicely and intuitively, with oversteer and understeer very predictable to controllable. The assists make for a very accessible experience, but turn them off and its a different tale, with more powerful cars becoming somewhat of a handful.  Visuals can hold their own against more modern titles with ease, and the EGO engine will run beautifully even on older hardware.  No real negative, only thing it the DLC was never released for PC, but a quick Google search will completely resolve that ;)"
One of best racing games ever !!!
"Damn easy even with hard mode. Nice graphics, but too easy gameplay."
"Probably the most underrated racing game out there. Realistic, fun, and addicting"
"Great game. Physics are ok, I for one this the drifting is a little off. To, acrade like. Otherwise a good game."
"Good Gameplay, Nice Cars, Epic Races, Go Get."
Really good racing game
"This game is pretty sick, especially for $5 on GMG this weekend"
One of the best arcade racing games ever.
Very good game. the driving requires you to focus on certain racing styles. Drifting can be hard with the keyboard. a steering wheel or contollor should make it a bit easier. for an older game it looks amazing and has a good bit of play time to it.
"Take this game seriously. You will crash and be forced to quit/restart if you try to make a turn at full speed. If you damage a tire enough, expect your car to automatically turn in one direction. It's fun if you play with the right mindset. Pros: -You can choose a name/nickname for the announcer to say (I chose the name 'Boss', so the announcer kept calling me 'Boss' &gt;:3) -Cars feel great -Demolition Derby (extremely aggressive racing) is fun and intense -Great variety of race types -Mostly consistent physics Cons;  -STEAM'S SCREENSHOTS ARE LYING TO YOU. THIS IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE VANILLA VERSION OF GRID.  -Maps feel repetitive after several hours of gameplay -All races (besides drift races) are good only with controller -Drift racing is good only with keyboard (I struggled with a controller but blew away the competition with a keyboard) -TIRES blocking your path will give you headaches if you run into them"
"This is the best racing game I've EVER played! Got it originally on PS3, bought Grid 2 and this came with it (for PC). Hopefully Grid 2 will be better! Buy this game....NOW!"
you can set it so that the 24 hours of le mans actually takes you 24 hours to beat
I just love it.....helpful huh.... ;p
"Great game, very solid mechanics, good graphics that run on a very minimalistic system, good progression system and great AI. The AI makes it really fun to play without being rubberbandish. It also has real cars and tracks. It can be hard to see the corners sometimes when you go very fast, especially on the Lemans track. Talking about Lemans, it's too much. I understand that you race Lemans after each season, but I feel like I'm doing that race after every 2 or 3 tournaments and it gets a bit boring. Amazing game overall, I can really reccomend it."
"I originally saw Race Driver: Grid on YouTube. Much like many modern gamers, its uncountable number of Let's Plays and playthroughs showed me at the time that it was one of the most immersive racing games I could get for the PC. Needless to say, I eventually broke down and bought it. This review is solely the experience I've had after having played it (when I could) over the past few years.  (If you're wondering about the (relatively extremely short) hour count I have on the Steam version, most of my time was spent on a non-Steam version years ago. Long story short I lost that copy and repurchased it on here a few months ago, hence the lack of hours logged. You don't need too many hours on the Steam version to know it's buggy, though... More on that later.)  Grid, some say, took the Dirt series and put it on asphalt. What there was in this game was mostly appealing; beautiful graphics, an excellent variety of cars, complete with dramatic damage models and high-definition, animated vehicle interiors on world-famous (and other fictional) tracks. The vehicles are extremely detailed in both visual and aural design, including the whine of the turbocharger, the clunk of the E-brake and pedals, the intense screeching scrape of trading paint with the track wall or another driver and the unsettling whirring and whining of the steering linkage after one too many collisions.   Initially, I found it difficult to learn how exactly to drive in-game, as at the time I only had a keyboard/mouse setup instead of an Xbox 360 controller (which, essentially, the game was originally designed for, that or a racing wheel... you can use a mouse and keyboard but in my experience you've got your work cut out for you in terms of handling. I don't have a racing wheel, can't judge that). The AI is quite challenging for that of a racing game in my opinion; your mileage may vary but it's difficult enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, while irritating you to no end should you have to restart a race due to being slammed into the wall or aggressively shoved between other competitors like a hot potato... made of metal, rubber, fabric, plastic and glass... with an exploding engine inside it. What a visceral experience, at least!  There was also a (fairly popular as I recall) online multiplayer mode in which you could buy and sell cars to each other (via a virtual eBay Motors, apparently... in-game advertising at its finest) and compete in races across the world. There were several planned DLC, including new cars, multiplayer race events and tracks. Even the singleplayer events were awesome: gymkhana-style drifting challenges, circuit racing, touge (a relay-style race on windy mountain roads from start-to-finish-to-start in two laps against one competitor).   There was a novel gameplay mechanic Grid introduced called Flashback, where in the event of a crash you can 'rewind' a race to before the crash occurred to give yourself a few extra chances to complete it. There's nothing quite as cathartic as taking a turn apex at 190 mph, hopping into the air off a rumble strip, smashing through a tire barricade and three other cars and coming to a rest pancaked against the track wall... knowing you have three Flashbacks left!  You could create a virtual racing team, hire drivers and leverage their talent to give yourself a chance at dethroning some of the best drivers in the world. There was even a (time-compressed, obviously) simulation of the world-famous 24 Hours of Le Mans championship, an endurance race in which you have to fight your way to the head of the pack and avoid crashing for 24 minutes straight. Outside of all of this, the game's modding community allowed you to edit your own cars... although, because of a lack of research, I can't exactly say to what extent you could modify or replace vehicle models for sure.  The above is why I loved this game despite all its flaws.  These days, however, I see the game from a different, more critical perspective. Due to it being succeeded by sequels including Grid 2 and Grid: Autosport, it seems apparent that Codemasters have long since given up on maintaining support for the original Grid. Several game-hampering, if not game-breaking, bugs still exist, including some which cause framerate stuttering, the game's audio to loop unexpectedly (a problem I personally have NEVER gotten rid of, even after reinstalling, messing around with my game files to prevent the Flashback system file from ballooning to several gigabytes in size and disabling hardware audio rendering) and even random crashes to desktop.   I've even read on Grid's Steam Community forums that some players' computers restart randomly after the game crashes -- but that's their word, not mine, this has never happened to me. The online multiplayer servers have long since been shut down entirely, inexplicably over a year before Grid 2's release, thus rendering the entire multiplayer mode broken -- albeit, according to Wikipedia, only for PS3 and PC, the Xbox 360 version's multiplayer may still be *ahem* Live. Not to mention that one of the promised DLC packs was never actually released. I got into the game far too late to actually purchase any of the DLC, so it's not necessarily something I'll miss as much, but it's still fairly disappointing. Even the game's support website has been removed - last time I checked, Codemasters' site only had support and forums for Grid 2 and Autosport unless I'm mistaken, which I could very well be.  The worst part is, in my opinion this was the best Grid ever, the finest game yet in the franchise. There are many great features in the sequels, but for me personally I loved the immersion more than any other feature, which makes Codemasters' idiotic decision to completely remove the cockpit mode from Grid 2 and put it back in in Autosport with cockpits not nearly as detailed as those in a game six years old somewhat painful. I'm still not sure I'll ever come back to this franchise, as at this point in time there's honestly better racers dedicated to arcade gameplay AND simulation, especially on Steam, putting the Grid franchise in a position of questionable purpose.  There are many reasons for me to recommend this game and many for me to warn you that you might be wasting your money. I've outlined most of them, but here's a brief recap:  Pros: -Beautiful, immersive vehicles, environments and audio -A wide variety of vehicles, environments and challenges -Then-popular online multiplayer and vehicle trading features -A fairly-decent (by today's standards, at least) example of early DLC -Very well-received, averaging 87% for all platforms on Metacritic (if you really believe in that sort of thing) -Some degree of end-user modifications! -Racing wheel and Xbox 360 controller support... in a racing game... thank you. -Fairly detailed level of customizable handling for peripherals  Cons: -Numerous unresolved, unavoidable, game-breaking bugs in PC version which at best harm immersion and at worst temporarily destabilize your computer... apparently? YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY... Heh, racing jokes -Multiplayer mode hastily discontinued -Official customer support non-existent, hastily discontinued -Sequels take the same formula and remove entire features unexpectedly... the entire series, it seems, has been trying to reinvent itself by force, for better or worse -Incomplete DLC release (gee, kinda like another racing game I liked a lot... *ahem*BurnoutParadise*ahem*)  EDIT: 9/25/2014: I'm going to change my mind on my previous verdict and say that despite all its flaws (and in light of the fact that GameRanger can perhaps replace multiplayer and I finally learned that the audio glitch may have been caused by a peripheral), Grid is a very competent game that, if you can run it smoothly, will probably satisfy your racing/immersion urges if you're into beautiful visuals and arcade fun.  Final verdict: a flawed gem  7.9/10"
"8/10 PLEASE READ IF YOU CANT BEAT THE LAST RACE!  game was very fun up until the end. i played the whole game choosing casual diffuculty for my races (because im a  filthy casual,it has nothing to do with the +100 games i own on steam and wanting to finish them all lol). the last race is against ravenwest after beating all the global league races and im not sure why but the race difficulty is set to extreme and you cant change it (which i think its a load of bull). heres what you do to get a easy win:         YouTube™ Video:  How to win the last race in race driver grid&nbsp;"
"If you love cars, if you love rancing, if you love crashing, if you love FUN, then get this game.  The graphics, even though this is a 2008/7 game, are amazing. High detail on each model, inclunding interiors!  Gameplay is fun as hell, with soft body parts physics that make you finish a race with a totally destroyed car. Crashes are fun as hell, so even if you can't win, you can put on a good show.  Races are also good, from touring car championships, to drifting and japanese Initial-D style racing. Open wheeled, touring cars, Le Mans, you name it!  This is the perfect racing game."
"Wow.  A 7 year old game that still kicks ♥♥♥! I had never played this game before, in fact, never even heard of it, which im a little disappointed in myself for. Picked this game up for a little over 3 bucks and my god this is one impressive game. Even if it's not on sale I still recommend getting it. The racing is incredibly exciting"
First of all I've never played any of the Grid games. So obviously I wanted to try it. I didn't want no crappy racing game where the only thing you do is take left turns or a game where you have to buy a higher tier car just to win the races. NO! I wanted SIMULATION! A game that feels amazing! Your probably saying to yourself that this guy is crazy...well...you might be right there. BUT thats not the point! the point is that this is an amazing game!!! And you know what?!? I don't care if you don't listen to me! I can not say it enough! THIS IS AN AMAZING GAME! That will be all I have to say...
"An older, but still fantastic racing game that combines the right balance of simulation with accessibility and fun. I still consider this to be one of the top titles by Codemaster and even better than their recent offerings in the Grid franchise."
"For a racing game, it's a mix between simulation and arcade. The cars in the game have an immense amount of grip compared to other racing games (but still feels natural), this adds to the sense of speed the game already provides when you're able to zip around corners along with other race cars (More so if you race in the first person perspective like I do in this game).  From my standpoint, I like to race clean and try not to hit other cars and the AI in this game is very responsive to where you are in relation to where they are, there are few situations where the AI just straight up runs into you. If you cut into their racing line, they will for the most part, respond very swiftly and try to avoid crashing to you. AI provides a very good challenge.  Excellent game in general, for a racing fan like me it's a nice mix between arcade and simulation. It's preferable if you had a gamepad or a steering wheel because of the tight racing."
By far the best racing game I've ever played.
Buy it for the menu music alone.A great racing game with good potential to be the best.
"It's your average codemasters racing game. Not bad, but not better than the predecessor or the successor."
this is a very fun racing game for everyone but i would not recomend trying to play it with out a controller
"One of my all time favorite racing games, period. Buy this game now and see why that is so."
"For me this is the perfect amount of realism. Yes I'm a fan of more arcade like racing games but not too much arcade like for example NFS Most wanted. For me this is the perfect balance. The game is 5 years old by now but it still looks good feels modern, I would recommend trying it today."
"I really enjoy this game.The driving is fun, and the handling is varied between vehicles and classes. The race modes are a good mix of hectic sideways action (drift events) and precision apex driving (GT1/2). It sits in that happy little place between arcade and simulator.  But it isn't perfect. Here are some things I found damn annoying: Technical Issues: - The pit crew guy that constantly provides updates has a damn annoying voice. Unfortunately you can't turn him off in a useful way. You can reduce the voice volume, but this also means reducing you crew mate/racer who actually says useful things. Also, if you turn down the voice volume, you still get sound dipping of race/engine sounds when he communicates... even though he is muted. Crazy right. - The AI crashes, sometimes the AI will spin out in a corner. Fine, it happens. But, the way it happens is pretty much their car jumps to the side a metre or so and then they lose it. Maybe the hand of God?  Personal Opinion: - Need for Speed: The Run had a totally epic race challenge called 'Porsche Attack' it's a 6 minute point-to-point time trial up a series of hairpins to the top of a mountain, then a fast open hillside into an epic flowing downhill decent. Anyone who has played that level knows what I'm talking about. Grid has nothing like that. Generally the tracks are very flat and don't have much character. There is no feeling, no adrenaline, no 'wow, this is awesome' just clinical &amp; controlled racetracks. It may be enough for some, but I was a little disappointed."
"Great simulator, great racing, fantastic controls, spectacular graphics, lots of camera angles (including helmet cam), great replays, tons of awesome cars, realistic car damage, realistic driving (you can turn traction control off etc). The replay value is infinite, the career never ends. This game would be great for anyone interested in a really immersive yet simple racing sim, ESPECIALLY if you have a steering wheel."
"For racing fans, this can be an enjoyable game. Even though it is quite old, I can say the physics is quite realistic and the graphics is nice. It is not a racing arcade. And it is not that hard when compared to Codemaster's DiRT series.  You initially need to learn how to maneuver your car well enough. I have experienced car spinning during my early hours of playtime. I play with a keyboard though. A gamepad may help a bit, but haven't tried."
I could sit all day trying to do the most clean drift.
"Easily one of the best racing games of a generation. Period. It's just right on the line where worlds shift between arcade to realistic, and the intensity of this game's racing is (from what I've experienced) yet to be rivaled. Vastly underrated, excruciatingly under supported by its developers and just a good game as it was... GRID is one of those games in its class which comes along and not many people know what to do with and many more have no idea a game as good as this even exists, and that's a shame. A DAMN shame because this is a DAMN good racer!  To get a glimpse of what this game comes close to: Imagine your most favoite race car/car chase/high octane car scene from any high budget movie and you get a taste of what this game feels like, but you're playing it... you're doing yourself a massive injustice NOT to play this game. If there's ONE racing game you must have, GRID is that game. I cannot stress enough how much I love this racer.  Have you watched the trailer?!!"
This game is tons of fun the only bad thing now is that the online is off. I think it still works on Xbox 360 though. Anyway for 5 bucks you can't go wrong if you're looking for a great single player experience.
Solid racer that still holds up today.
"Playing DiRT 3 made me realise how good this game is and I'm not just saying that because the game goes 'Hello Jamie, welcome back' when I launch it. The racing itself is a lot more entertaining, well done customisation, a stylish interface that doesn't try too hard, no annoying menu characters, no GFWL, no insisting I stick my replays on youtube and no mass DLC. What I like about both games however is how crashing drastically effects the cars performance and how there is a rewind feature to help out terrible drivers like me."
"They don't call it simulator, but it's not an arcade driving game either, with assistance off you will have a little trouble to drive smooth. Has lots of different competitions and cars, so you can spend all the time you want with your team."
A classic must have.  FFB = 7/10 Sounds= 7/10 Physics = 7/10 Color saturation =8/10 Track graphics = 8/10 Car graphics = 8/10  Menu = 7/10  CPU+GPU optimization = 8/10 Wheel suport = 6/10 Content = 8/10 Reflections/shadows = 7/10
"AMAZING game, well worth the price! The graphics are fantastic, not as great as GRID II but they are still very nice for the price. The game is very realistic and not like the old NFS games where you would never die, the realisticness makes it more challenging and addicting as well! Great choice of cars, career mode is great, will keep you hooked. Great game, great graphics, great storyline, great price!"
"The Drifting is respectfully accurate to real life drifting, it feels like drifting in snow. the best racing game played so far."
Dis game is coo' if u like racin games u should play dis game.
Definitely the best racing game on Steam!
This is a game about driving cars!
Still one of the best Racing Games I have ever played. You need to play this game if you're tired of the same old Racing games.
It is a mix of simulation and arcade-style racing with various modes for variety.
"Less track variety than a one-armed junkie, but still very rewarding and a solid racing game."
Best driving game of all time
"Good game, campaign is ruined by random Club GT races though, would have been much better to seperate the classes into their own comps that way people dont have to suffer through racing with boring cars that handle like complete ♥♥♥♥ if they dont want to."
"Grid although now a few years old is one of those rare games that really does stand up against the tied of time, even now it is a beautiful looking game with some really good detail touches. The car models are really nice and the damage model convincing.  It holds up as a very challenging game which keeps you gripped and on the edge of your seat.  Those who comment on poor handling clearly need to learn how to break before corners and think like a real racer.  I loved this game on xbox 360 and enjoyed many hours online, playing it on pc means I can enjoy the way it really was intended to look, and that is stunning.  My only gripe really is with Codemasters shutting off the servers and not patching the game to allow people to run their own servers, so no online play. Saying that there are methods of still playing it online by using 3rd party apps, however I have found them to be a bit hit and miss, sometimes resulting in a good connection with other players, but then the connection randomly dropping for no reason. Real shame.  Still single player is fun and very challenging, if your a petrol head and don`t mind just playing single player, or want to try the alternate methods of playing online I recommend this game. To be honest I prefer this original Grid to the sequel, which in my opinion lost some of its spark and challenge, not to mention the loss of the Destruction Derby part which was always hugely popular (shame on you Codemasters)."
"I've played a fair amount of pro racing sims, but thus far GRID is the only one to make me feel like I'm truly a professional race driver moving up through the ranks. It's wonderfully slick in presentation, and even though it's a bit over five years old at the time of this message, it doesn't seem to have aged a bit against more recent titles in the genre. It consistently delivers quality, immersive racing - even if there's a bit of a learning curve - and the career mode is brilliantly paced and addicting. Simply put, it's both fun and convincingly realistic, in a genre infamously known for often shoving fun into the backseat in favor of unwavering realism. I don't believe there's a better pro racer for the price."
"My IRL job is being a racingdriver. So i always go in to racing games expecting an arcade-ish feeling. More often than not i'm right. Grid is one of those arcade-ish games but to be honest it's fine. Grid is just really, really fun!  The handling is nowhere near realistic but it allows for some hilarious driving. Sliding through corners in 200 km/h is a blast. You always feel in control! Being able to undo your mistakes with the reverse time thingie is great if you're just playing it for fun.  The races are often very fun as well, it can get a bit dull sometimes when you have to do the same race twice but the track is just reversed or something.  The graphics are good and pleasant to look at but the in game voices are really ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Some more lines for the team manager speaking to you would be nice.  The cars in the game are very nice and it contains quite a lot of dreamcars! But since this game was released several years ago you won't find the newest models.  All in all it's a fun racing game and to my surprise i really enjoyed it! Grid 2 is even better so buy that as well!"
UTTER ♥♥♥♥ DONT BUY IT! Controls are screwed and overall crap forcefeedback!
One of the best racing games I have played. Arguably one of the most realistic racing sim games.
lots of fun with friends
I love this game. I find myself coming back to this game at least once a year and just having a blast.
Very nice semi-hardcore racing game with nice graphics even now. Recommend it!
One timer as this is the Better Version of GRID 2
"This is a great racing game for people who enjoy racing games and people who don't. I get very frustrated with many racing games, but GRID is very forgiving and fun to play for any skill level. Highly recommend playing with a controller."
"First off I'd like to say that this is indeed a fun game, even now years after it first came out. However, there are plenty of reviews you could read that would go into specifics in much greater (and better) detail than I myself could or would.  I wanted to let everyone know the way to get 1080 (or any resolution you can run) properly, as I know I was unable when first booting up the game.  Baseline (Widescreen) Solution &amp; Issues Naive.  There is a setting to select the screen aspect ratio. The default setting is 'Normal', an auto mode that always follows the current resolution's AR. Selecting a specific ratio will stretch the screen to match the selection. Ratios available: 4:3, 5:4, 16:10, 16:9, 5:3.  An important thing to note is that the game does not support resolutions above 1440x900 and 1280x1024 if a graphic card with less than 512mb is detected. The game might incorrectly detect the amount of vram when using newer graphics cards, which will lock you out of using higher resolutions. Follow these steps to solve this problem:  1) Look for your hardware_settings_restrictions.xml file in your 'system' folder (default for steam version: C:\Steam\steamapps\common\grid\system\), and make a backup.  2) Open the file with Notepad. Scroll down to the bottom, remove the following entry and save the file:  data res mem='270' maxWidth='1280' /data  The restriction is now gone and you can play the game at your native resolution.  This is from  http://www.wsgf.org/dr/race-driver-grid  , and I had no input, but I wanted everyone else to know the fix in case they were like me and about to un-install an otherwise wonderful game."
"This is a terrific racing game, gives the player a lot of different options. I mean if you can find another game that has anything from Demolition Derby Racing, to Drift Races, to Muscle, Tuner, and Formula races. Tell me about that game I'll have to try it after this one. I would give this game an 8/10 just because they give you specific cars you can choose from each race but definitely still fun and addicting nonetheless. Oh, and also the ability to customize your team with the branding, what sponsors it has, and the teammates to choose from give this game an added benefit towards its score for me. Well hopefully this was informative enough, and I hope it gave you insight into what your getting into if you buy this amazing racing game."
One of the best Racing games I have played!
way i cant play Grid anymore o_O §??? 
This game is freakin awesome. I can't wait till part 2 goes on sale again.
I recommend you DON'T buy this game.
"Probalby the best driving game I've ever played, just one thing...I F#$%ing hate Touge. Even with some frustrating moments the great graphics and excellent physics make this game a great buy."
This is a good racing game and I played it a lot.
"Looks, sounds and feels amazing. One of Codemasters' finest racing games, and one of the few racing games that actually feels fast and brutal. Gets the heart pumping! Also has the best drifting physics ever. Ever. Evereverever."
best racing game ever 10/10
My name should be in the game but it's not.
where create account online not ingame ?
"Race Driver GRID or just GRID.. I have played enough of this on PC/PS3 to make a review...  I bought the game way back when it was new for the PS3 and it was the most realistic racer to date. You started by driving for other teams and eventually for your own team. The physics were incredible and graphics were the best at the time. I did enjoy it back then. The online sessions with friends were so fun back then.. But now few years later I bought GRID again for the PC to see if I still enjoy it as much as before. I can honestly say, I really do enjoy GRID even to this date. Now theres all sorts of other racers like Forza Motorsport series, Assetto Corsa, Project CARS....   The game runs really well even on lower end PC's and the wheel support is amazing. Graphics are still enjoyable, and so are the physics. I'd recommend this instead of GRID 2 / GRID Autosport. GRID 2 is more like arcade. And Autosport isn't that great.. They did it right only on GRID '1'. Here's some pros and cons..  PROS: -Decent graphics even to this date. -Variety of racing events (touge, drifting, prototype, formula..) -Brilliant wheel support.  -ALOT of content.  -'Story' is amazing (owning your own team) -Physics and damage modeling is fantastic.   CONS: -Some issues while playing (game would crash sometimes. Maybe every 4th startup?) -Online sessions are gone I believe. (I couldn't connect)"
get it it is fantastish
Best racing game on the market. From 2008 with love.
I can't even describe how good this game is. just buy it. dont even question it.
"GRID is a classic racing game that ushered a new era in the genre. It came at a time when racing games needed new blood and some revolution to keep the genre alive.  Revisiting this title today is still as fun as it was when it released. The gameplay and driving is still very solid compares to modern day racing games. The variety in cars, races and sponsorship challenges will still entertain racing fans for hours.  The graphics are obviously dated by now, but it is very easy to look past this when searching for a good racing title to fill the gaps."
"This game is amazing. I had just played Autorama, (Horrible), so I had very low standards. I started playing, it was amazing, one of the best I've ever personally played in my undead days. A few days later, I had normal standards again. It was still one of the best games I've ever personally played. The suspension has a great model, as well as the deformation of the cars themselves. It is worth every single penny plus more. I'd give it a 2. Out of 1. It is that good."
"Its a miracle, and I was wrong. The game doesnt handle the worst, it handles the best. For those who didnt read my review before this edit, I was saying that the handling is the worst and most horrible. But obviously, I forget about the settings panel, and Lord Gaben kept his money. So I now recommend this game, its really good! (Also, the Skyline R34 is still there, so Gabe can keep his money)"
"GRID's reputation as one of the best racing games is well deserved. As has been mentioned, it finds that perfect sweet spot between 'arcade' racing and hard-core simulation and just goes flat out with it. The sheer variety in gameplay is also impressive. The tracks range from tight, city-based runs to wide-open racetracks to mountain roads, most with variations; the cars all handle quite differently, from open-wheel to stock to supercars; and the events can be straight laps, drift, downhill, demolition, and more. Even the same tracks can feel quite different when equipped with different classes of cars. The career mode is also lots of fun, ramping up the challenge in an appropriate way. Acquiring and managing new cars and sponsors was more fun than I expected.  I'm no racing guy, but it's amazing how much more of an experience this is from arcade-drive-gaming. It's the perfect combination of challenging and forgiving, and lots and lots of in-the-zone fun. Take some time with it and dig in; it's one hell of a ride."
"Don't like the complicated nitpicky details of sims like Gran Turismo? Just wanna focus on driving, like focusing on finding that perfect curve through a turn? Wanna try your hand at Japanese mountain Tou-ge? How bout driving an Indy Car? Do ya like drifting? Wanna drive real world cars in real world locations instead of fictional ones like in Ridge Racer? This game's GOT IT ALL. Beautiful graphics (you ought to check out the day/night transition while racing in the 24 hr. Le Mans (24 hrs in about 13 minutes that is...)). An impressively slick menu system. This is the polished, 'triple A' game you arcade racers out there were waiting for."
"GRID is a terrifically fun racing game, period. The mechanics skew to the arcade end of the spectrum but if you nudge the realism options upwards you'll find the game achieves a nice balance on the simulation end. Even on basic difficulty level however the game carries a beautifully polished driving experience that hardly any game can match. You're not playing bumper cars here *cough*BURNOUT*cough*.  There's a career mode which tasks you with increasing leagues and racing circuits which put you in a wide variety of cars and driving styles, most of which are great fun to play. The team voiceovers are interesting to start but grow repetitive after awhile sadly. In the quick-play mode you can also mix and match car options and create weird off-kilter arrangements.   GRID dazzles with lustrous cars and lighting effects, plus amazingly dynamic car crashes during slow mo instant replay moments. The game oozes style. It's an easy buy if you've got a gamepad or steering wheel. A+ fun."
"Meh, not dat gewd, but it's ok to kill time."
"fun, just wish there was still multiplayer"
"GET THIS. Steering is easily tweaked in advanced settings, and works flawlessly with XBOX controller on PC. I give this 9 out of 10 stars !!!"
"8.5/10 Could be one of the best racer games I’ve ever played, GRID does it right in almost every way definitely a racing game you should experience even if you're not a fan of the genre. The environment is fantastic along with the progression system which does not seem like a chore like in other racers. The controls are also great normally I would recommend playing on a controller but keyboard and mouse still works very well. Bonus is that is very cheap when it comes up on deals."
"Grid is one of the best racing games ever made. It's not a hard core sim, but it's not supper arcady either. Don't lose your focus, because you colud easly find yourself totaled. Some of the best damage modeling in racing games."
"Purchased at about $7  One of the best racers on PC, I feel. Extremely pretty and optimized engine, and the online play worked great before they shut it down, but there's still an active community playing online via tunneling network software. This was a perfect balance of arcade racing with realistic effects and damage."
best racing game in ages
"This is a fantastic racing game, at 4.99 don't hesitate."
By far the best racing game out there... BUY IT NOW!
"Years after it came out, GRID still holds its ground as one of the best arcade driving games around. Still visually stunning, with a great Rewind feature, this is a must for any casual-driving gamer."
The best racing game ever. A perfect mix of arcade and simulation.
"If you want a racing game, this should be the first one you play. It does more for the genre in one game than most franchises pull off their entire life. The only downside would be the limited maps and lack of customization for your car beyond paint and sponsor stickers. A fun, arcade style race management portion that feels tacked on instead of integrated from the beginning helps make this more than just going fast in circuits."
"Never really was a fan of race games.... untill Grid. Gotten so many good times out of this game, the campaign is fun and multiplayer with friends is a blast and even the normal online scene is still pretty strong. It's an arcade racing sim... think that's the best way to describe it.... not realistic enough to be called a sim, but it's a lot more ''sim'' then tons of other racing games..."
"-FIRST THOUGHTS RECCOMENDATION- This game isn't really a perfection, but it is good. I wouldn't really get it if it's not on sale(got it for 4.5€). If you get off the track you spin out every time, this is very un-realistic and makes you kinda mad. Other drivers follow the difficulty setting. Cool feature is flashbacks-reverse time back and maybe correct a corner etc. Cars are not really detailed, but are fair enough. Before each race you also choose one of three objectives thatyou can complete for extra cash. Game seemed to have an online multiplayer feature too, which was abandoned later on(there is this option in the menu, but it doesn't want to connect to the internet). Final thoughts: Game is good, would need some improvements tho(buy other Codemasters driving games if you must!)  My raating: 6/10"
"I'm not really well versed in racing games so I don't feel like I can give this game a fair review, but for the little i've played, I really enjoyed this one!  The Good: +Graphics: They're really, really nice! To say the least, for a game I snagged through Humble Bundle, I wasn't expecting such a smoothe feel to the game and such a nice aesthetic.  +Gameplay: Had to use X360ce to get my logitech contoller to work with it, but once I did, man, the game feels great.  +Easy to get into: I crashed my car like a 100x's before I finally remembered how to play a damn racing game, but that was because of my lack of skill and not how easy it was to just start and play the game.  +Voice Acting: Really smoothe voice acting! I was a bit freaked out at first when they called me by my name...but I remembered the option to choose your nick name, and, yea. Is pretty nice addition  The Bad: -No controller support besides 360: So, the 360 controller is supported standard. Anything else you need to use a workaround like 360ce. Kinda frustrating, but oh well. -Other drivers are ♥♥♥♥♥: Not really a bad, but man, they suck.  -Can't really think of anything else, really.  Overall: Like I said, I don't play these games often so I can't give a fair review. But, it's a fun game and i'll probably be playing more of it inbetween other games."
"Can be arcade and can be somewhat a simulator. It has a very long campaign but Codemasters removed the MP side of the game, wish I could have bought this game to try it out MP. Graphics are niiiice too, absolutely a must have if you're into racing games."
One of the best arcade style racers I have ever played. I just wish they would get around to making a second one.
Picked it up on sale for $3 and change. May be 5 years old but it's not like racing games have changed that much. Great value and great fun!
"This game is pretty sick, especially for $5 on GMG this weekend"
One of the best arcade racing games ever.
One of the best racing games ever made. Ravenwest will make you ravenrage.
Very Good Graphics...
"I've been experimenting with running games on my Surface Pro (v1). This game runs great, you won't have the top notch graphics, but it works for a very mobile platform. If you've got a Surface Pro, check my other reviews, as I've been trying several games.  The game is not easy for those of you that enjoy arcade racers, and I'd recommend a controller be used. But if you'd like a little more challenge in your racing game, this would be a good place to start. And at $15, it's hard to go wrong."
"Take this game seriously. You will crash and be forced to quit/restart if you try to make a turn at full speed. If you damage a tire enough, expect your car to automatically turn in one direction. It's fun if you play with the right mindset. Pros: -You can choose a name/nickname for the announcer to say (I chose the name 'Boss', so the announcer kept calling me 'Boss' &gt;:3) -Cars feel great -Demolition Derby (extremely aggressive racing) is fun and intense -Great variety of race types -Mostly consistent physics Cons;  -STEAM'S SCREENSHOTS ARE LYING TO YOU. THIS IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE VANILLA VERSION OF GRID.  -Maps feel repetitive after several hours of gameplay -All races (besides drift races) are good only with controller -Drift racing is good only with keyboard (I struggled with a controller but blew away the competition with a keyboard) -TIRES blocking your path will give you headaches if you run into them"
"Great racing game, may prove difficult when played without driving assists but that's how I like it. The career mode is simple but feels great, too bad Codemasters did not expand on the team building theme. As far as presentation the game still looks and sounds good."
"Great racing, amazing graphics (even on my older machine), satisfying destruction... but what's most surprising is the feel of the cars--a really noticeable weight to them that's lacking in most arcade racers (incl NFS); it makes a great feeling of slinging tons of metal around corners etc."
I recommend its pretty cool.
Really good driving game. Takes a bit of practice though. 
One of my favourite racing games!
This is the greatest Initial D game of all time.
"Loved Grid straight away when i first bought it for my ps3 and i have to say the graphics still look great on my high end pc. Great Racer, cars feel good"
"Only disappointment is drift (sucks)  And drift cars are only available for the stupid drift competitions. Everything else is great what can I say, I got it for 2.99 :') "
Graphically superb despite being an older game. Shame I crash all the time.
Great gmae suck there is no longer online servers to play on as single player once done that it may as well delete local content
Its NOT FORZA but it will do.
"One of the best racing games of the new generation. Amazing graphics for that time which didn't use a lot of resources. I remember having tried this game when it first came out with a sh*tty computer and it ran flawlessly. I own all GRiD games and I still play this one once in a while. Long carreer mode, lots of cars. Only thing I don't like is that there's only a range of cars to choose for every event, the rest of the game is simply amazing."
"My favorite racing game. I love the balance between fun and realism. The graphics are a little greyed out and there is not enough muscle car racing, but this game ages really well. If you like racing, buy it!"
if you love fast cars nice drifts and a bit of le mans then this is the game too play =)
"In honour of Grid Autosport which releases today in Europe and having nearly completed this game. I am proud to say that it is certainly one of the better racers that have graced the pc and the console, the cars handle well, tracks feel genuine, the announcers comments can be a bit corny every now and then, there isn't so much as an upgrade system like there is in say the old 'need for speed' games, but being able to buy cars either new or used from(in game) Ebay feels satisfactory, it feels like you've acheived something. The track announcer keep you up to date with who's leading, who's had a crash and so forth, your manager standing on the side lines giving telling you the condition of your car, which also accompenied by a wonderful HUD with how fast you're going, what position your in, how bad the damage on the car is and all to be topped off with a wonderful map so planning your turns/drifts are a must if you wish to survive.   Before each race you have the choice of setting how difficult, wether you want to use the rewind feature and how often(or less), along with the standard automatic manual gear change.  Now that the good has been said there's not to much bad to say really about this game, a part from that drifting with actual drifting cars might feel abit more slippery then it needs to be and is a very delicate balance between a spin out and a drift. And even though this isin't actually bad cornering with a drift it does feel like the other cars are better at drifting then the ones designed for it.  Closing comments: I can't say much for Grid 2, but the original is definitly the better of the two in terms of control and just all round enjoyabilty. My take on Grid 2 and Autosport are bound to come later."
"Cool game, surprised by how good it was even if it is from 2008. Reccomended to try."
"Not a simulator nor full blown arcade. I love it, it is fun, looks great and is overall pretty good, though the campaign isnt that long"
Probably the best racing game I ever had! ^-^
"Most realistic racing game I have ever played. Really tough, but fun. It's not too annoying either like other racing games--if you don't win 1st place, you still progress in the game (just more slowly)."
"Fast-paced, adrenaline-filled, action-pumped racing. Spectacular to look at and extraordinary to listen to. And even more fun to play."
"The game is pretty solid, not many PC racing games can seem to get the simulation-arcade balance games like Gran Tourismo and Forza seem, but GRID comes pretty close. The racing feels like it's almost simulation, but is easy enough to get into. There is a decent car list and good number of tracks, I just wish the story mode had the number of events GRIDs console counterparts have. Overall, if you're looking for a arcade-simulation game on the PC, this is one of the best I've played. Definitely worth whatever discounted price the game goes for these days."
"Crazy arcade racing on closed courses with intense crashes and epic drifts. If realism is what you're looking for, avoid this game like the plague, but if you are looking for a fast-paced arcade racer then look no further. Best crash physics I know of, and the damage modeling is almost on Burnout-levels."
This game is awesome. Still can't believe this game released 2008 o.O Graphics still cool but most important think its difficult and much realistic.
"It is a very good racing game, very realistic, but be prepared to be really challenged because it is a hard game and can get frusturating."
Fun arcade racer that still looks good years later.
"There are very few games that can captivate you through their immersiveness. GRID is one of those games, the career mode is excellent, plenty of options to unlock liecenses and new vehicles, 30 hours in the game and I am still not bored, I would highly recommend this game to those who likes the whole arcade experience with amazing graphics, excellent gameplay and plenty of cars to choose from, GRID is a classic and will go down a long way in the histoy. I hope EA learns something from CodeMasters."
"I'm playing this with a GTX 980 Build. Graphics still hold up and the game plays extremely well. They nailed everything, from the cockpit view to the fun cross between arcade/simulation handling. Multiple disciplines help evade boredom of some other racers. Damage model is great, (especially in the Derby Races) and building your own team and gaining sponsors is fun.  I loved this on the 360 many years ago and still love it on the PC to this day. Many thumbs up, def recommend!"
I have been told I am an abomination. People have given me looks of disgust when I told them. And it feels so wrong when I do it.   But I play racing games with a mouse and keyboard.   And GRID allows me to do that without being unplayable. For that I give it a thumbs up.
"This is Grid a mix of arcade and sim, its is also probably the first 7th gen game to ever do cockpit view really well even better then NFS Shift. All the cars move and feel realistic even when driving at full speed, damage pyhsic on cars feels so good to the point that it can impede your performance with the car prompting you to replay the turn again or to not damage your car. The AIs car are really good they dont pull you over, crashing into you unlike other driving games (driveclub) but your rival champions (ravenwest) present a good challenge. The one and only downside to this game is there are not much events (drift/downhill drift, circuit and sprint start to finish) in the game or maps (all reuse maps different variation) or cars (sure you have your exotics, F1 cars and supercars around about 50-60 cars) but for me these did not affect the way i play the game. If you like driving games and like the grid series but dont know which to get settle for grid or maybe grid autosport not 2. Thumbs up"
Very fun and easy to learn. Graphics are very slick looking and dont hit your frams to hard so you should be able to max this game out if you have a decent PC. CONTROLLER IS A MUST to be able to play this game with ease (in my opinion). Great buy was worth the money. 9/10
"If you are into arcade Handling and a racing game that is More Controller friendly over Wheel friendly then i would say buy this.  The graphics are pretty darn good for the age of this game. The Racing is frustrating yet still enjoyable,  I DO NOT RECOMMEND IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A RACING SIM! But i if you're that Arcade racer then BUY BUY BUY. :P"
Great racing game! Grab it on next sale!
It's worth the price!!
So first grow mutton chops. Then Race a car on them to get car skidmark muttonchops. Show them to everyone. Profit. Kinda like this game.
"Really fun racing game even if you suck at racing games (like I do). It looks fantastic and has a decent amount of cars, customization options, race modes, and tracks. The single player campaign structure keeps you motivated to continue racing and most races and cars never feel the same. 24 Hours of Le Mans races require some serious stamina to continuously compete in but luckily you can skip them if you prefer shorter races. The soundtrack is cool though nothing special. The flashback feature is perfect if you're a racing newbie like me, though I sometimes wish there was an option for unlimited flashbacks. Don't bother playing without a controller, keyboard controls are borderline impossible. I was very surprised that I enjoyed this game as much as I did, as normally I have an aversion to racing games, but this was a great, realistic, approachable, and fun racing game. I'd recommend it to anyone!"
"good game , expecialy le mans really do recomend but far cheeper on Other sites"
"if there ever was such an intence, action packed. smoke screen felling and out right real sence of speed on the track then **** me sideways   also the closest thing to a real tf&amp;f game"
"best for just drifting, graphics r great, great controls 8/10"
One of the best racing games I've ever played
Probably worth the buy now its cheap! fun game!
"Car damage system, flashback and demolition game mode are amazing features of this epic racing game. I also like the graphics and how smooth it plays. "
"If you want a racing game that combines arcade and simulation styles of racing, this game fits the bill. Defo worth a purchase if on sale/cheap."
"I really like playing racing games on easy, it's fun. the game looks good and plays well."
This game is freakin awesome. I can't wait till part 2 goes on sale again.
"Probalby the best driving game I've ever played, just one thing...I F#$%ing hate Touge. Even with some frustrating moments the great graphics and excellent physics make this game a great buy."
way i cant play Grid anymore o_O §??? 
"This is a great game. It is racing-sim-like, but not completely a dry sim. Unfortunaly the multiplayer servers are offline (forever), or I would still play it... The sequel grid 2 doesn't even come close =/."
Really fun game that has aged pretty well. Way better than the sequel.
"This game has aged very well. For a game that was released in 2008, it can still compete with newer racing games. I would highly recommend this game to people who have a need to have a fix of Racing.  My only issue with this game is the controls are a little ♥♥♥♥y. It uses the usual WASD like most PC games do, however, accel is W and break is S in the standard format. I would recommend changing it so that accel is still W, but break is down arrow."
"awesome racing simulator, its a must for racing fans........"
Race. Crash. Restart.
"Got this game on sale, and it was well worth it. It's certainly not Gran Turismo, but it does help to fill a gap for PC users wanting a fun racing game. The vehicles look nice, and the tracks are awesome. The physics are decent, but not great. There's too many times bumping into an opponent causes you to spin out. If I tap an opponent's rear corner, I shouldn't be the one spinning out... it's just not how physics work. Even worse is bumping into them side-by-side, your car essentially gets stuck to them until you slam into a wall, and slowing down doesn't seem to solve the issue until you're almost at a dead stop. Single player campaign is nice, but the opponents can be cheap as you progress towards the end.  All in all, the positives outweighed the negatives, and I would certainly recommend this game."
"Grid will challange you in the beginning. Your first drift you will restart probably fifty times. But once you get it, it will be hard not to fall in love with GRID.  10/10, my favorite racing game on PC."
It might just be the best racing game I've played on my PC
Short Seasons = Push Rep and Money harder
highly recommend buying this game! its alot of fun! not so bad graphics and the cars are awesome!
"Great racing sim that is still pretty today. If you don't own it, I would suggest buying it."
"One of the best ever made racing games, sure as hell the best of the series. Graphics still look great today, physics are amazing. Very long and interesting campaign with lots of different cars, the only thing thats bugging me is the difficult le mans race (which is 24 mins long) at the end of every season. Also I like upgrading my cars, which is sadly also not possible in this game, but I dont even think it would fit! 9.5/10 must buy!"
I only got to play this game many years after release and boy does it still hold up over that time. The graphics are good and the gameplay is accessible and doesn’t frustrate you when you’re driving.  It took GRID Autosport to give this title a proper sequel and I hope to see more from the GRID franchise.
This is still one of the greatest racing games out there. Definitely would recommend this to anyone who loves racing games!
Great game if u just want to do some casual solo player racing.
"Like most racing games, this one is a little over-complicated for my taste, but it's pretty fun for all that. And you can do plenty of damage to your car without any repurcussions, so that's always fun."
"It is a very good racing game, very realistic, but be prepared to be really challenged because it is a hard game and can get frusturating."
Fun arcade racer that still looks good years later.
It's cheap........and alot of fun with private friend matches. GET IT NOW

"GRID is a classic racing game that ushered a new era in the genre. It came at a time when racing games needed new blood and some revolution to keep the genre alive.  Revisiting this title today is still as fun as it was when it released. The gameplay and driving is still very solid compares to modern day racing games. The variety in cars, races and sponsorship challenges will still entertain racing fans for hours.  The graphics are obviously dated by now, but it is very easy to look past this when searching for a good racing title to fill the gaps."
Buy it now. Freakin awesome game. Codemasters always does a great job but this is the yardstick.
One of the best racers ever!
Better than any other Grid. 10/10
"This game teach you how to make some interest to sponsor and how to drive like a real world racer, Try to race with cockpit mode and feel the enjoyable World series and dont forget... dont hit the grass or you'll lose your race"
"My name is Daredevil, still not blind after surviving a 10g crash, but not fighting crime either.  overall opinion:  9.8/10  Game of the Year 20 years in a row"
the only game i play for drifting fun .. still unbeatable even now ..
"awesome racing game, has a little bit of arcadey physics to it and isn't the hyper-realistic experience of competing games (hint: this one isn't boring)."
"Want to race some awesome cars? Play this. Drift, Touge, Open Wheel, Touring Cars. Not an in depth game, very arcade like."
"This is a very good road racing game, but it's not a simulator. It's kind of right in between Need for Speed and Forza in terms of authenticity. I think it plays better than BOTH of those series, and there's an awesome team management layer on top that they took out of GRID 2, which was a real bummer. Also: 24 hours of Le Mans races. Hell of dope. If you like driving virtual cars but don't want to do it with laboratory-quality accuracy, you should get this game probably."
I recommend this game Control 8/10 (compared to nfs 2005) graphics 10000000/10 (compared to nfs 2005) Audio 10000000/10 (compared to nfs 2005 Campaign 5/10 (compared to nfs2005) *may vary with individuals AND overall 8/10 with an hour or so of gameplay
"Holy ♥♥♥♥, a game that actually calls you by you name. 10/10"
It's worth the price!!
"Like most racing games, this one is a little over-complicated for my taste, but it's pretty fun for all that. And you can do plenty of damage to your car without any repurcussions, so that's always fun."
One of best racing games ever. Simulator-like and really enjoyable. And its hard;)
"If you are into arcade Handling and a racing game that is More Controller friendly over Wheel friendly then i would say buy this.  The graphics are pretty darn good for the age of this game. The Racing is frustrating yet still enjoyable,  I DO NOT RECOMMEND IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A RACING SIM! But i if you're that Arcade racer then BUY BUY BUY. :P"

"click click click click click click click click click click ... 2 minutes race... click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click ..... what is it that I was doing again? Can't remember... perhaps that annoying man who keeps talking in my ear will tell me... nope... click click click click click click click click .... oh another race, good.  SHUT UP YOU TALKATIVE DISCORPORATE VOICE!!! "
"A very fun arcade racer. Not to be mistaken with a simulator since it does not have any tuning options or anything of that manner. Has enough race modes to keep things interesting, but I wish it had more cars and customization options.   8.75/10"
I was racing A car t-boned me That car kept driving I rammed into the air I spun around I barreled rolled I spun around in dirt for 10 seconds I got last place. 10/10 Would Rage Again
Absolutely Tops 93/100
"get ready for 20+ restarts per race, as you get tanked, sideswiped, and dipped by the npc drivers. Its a fun game, and beats the heck outa NFS since you cant bounce off walls to make turns and GAIN speed doing it. BUT crap happens on those tracks that should throw caution flags, or halts......and drivers should be disqualified at times, and if it were real to racing, they would. but not in here. you hit a barrier at 70kph, your done! npc hits one at same, and rolls right back on track, back in the race. ill have to thumbs up the game though, im stubborn, and addicted to it. GRID 2 is a good deal nicer though, spend your cash on GRID 2 if you want to invest in the grid series at all."
11/10 would crash again
LOVE IT!!!
"I had some extra cash. looked in the under 6$ section, saw this. said 'Meh, It'll do.' aND I DIDNT EXPEXT TO BE GETTING SUCH A GOOD GAME ITS FROM 2007 BUT ITS STILL AMAZING"
bots is really ♥♥♥♥ multiplayr yes shis game is goog or bots bots...♥♥♥♥♥!!
An amazing game with amazing grapics. I love this game and give it a 10/10!
"First of all, I don't even like racing games and my general interest in cars is almost non-existent. This said, Race Driver GRID is a visually-stunning game with excellent controls, a good selection of vehicles and highly appealing overall presentation. What makes it so compelling is the 'feel' of the driving: it is somewhere between Need for Speed and Forza/Gran Turismo, leaning towards the latter but without being a haven for pedantic autophiles."
"very well done, very realistic and yet still a fun racing game.  10/10"
"Awesome racing game, the driving is just so much fun. Good mix of realism and arcade!"
"I love this game. This is the good buy. GRID 2, not so much"
"BUY THIS NOT GRID 2  Hello there fellow steam users, first I would like to say that this is a great game. I don't usually like these types of games but this one is very nice.  The problems with 'GRID 2' which are amazing in 'GRID'  1. Not the same physics so you can't do the things you can in this game (like make the other cars crash by ramming them)  2. GRID 2 tells you 'there is damage to your car', this game tells you where (which wheel, transmition, engine, etc) and how much.  3. GRID 2 feels really linear, this one gives you a bunch of options on where and how you want to race.  DONT BUY GRID 2, BUY GRID 1 FOR MUCH LESS   and hopefully the creators will pick up that they started to head down the wrong road. (get it, it's a driving pun ;] )"
"This is perhaps one of Codemasters best. Whiel the studio seems to have lost its away a little lately with excessive DLC and unfullfilled promises of Steamworks for some of its older games (Dirt 3), this is still worth buying. It straddles the line between simulator and arcade very well, and offers a wide variety of racing disciplines. It also does a great job of engaging you in the racing world by having an in-race engineer (much more easy on the ears that the Block/Pastrana drivel in the Dirt series), teammates, sponsors and custom liveries. Worth your time if you want an engaging, but not too demanding simcade racer.  Pros + Looks great for an older game + Great range of vehicles + Engaging career mode  Cons + No difference in time between stiocking to race lines and powersliding every corner + Yellow post-processing + No official online mutliplayer anymore"
Grid is one of the best driving games ever made. the graphics and mechanics still stand up to modern games 6 years after it was released.
"Good driving mechanics, races aren't a pushover, and the AI knows what it is doing. The man on the radio can give you misleading information, but overall, I'd play this over most NFS games."
"Played it a few years ago and couldn't wait to pick it up myself. GRID is the perfect blend of realism and not, it'll punish you for your mistakes but it'll give you the chance to make up for them. I cannot recommend GRID enough."
"I am a bit late to the party with this game, but it is a truly brilliant arcade-style racer (well, maybe just a little bit more involved than an arcade game). As long as you are not expecting a racing simulator, you should enjoy it."
"I'm not very good at realistic racing games, so this game is frustratingly difficult for me, but still a fun game. Harder to play than Need For Speed: Shift. But not impossible for those like me that can't seem to get the hang of realistic racing games. Still very challenging, but still a good game."
Is Good For you
Do not buy this game..waste of money. .. quirky and unhandleable with Steering wheels and joysticks.
"This game is pretty god until you get to the LMP cars. Those things are straight up IMPOSSIBLE to drive without aids on, and if you like simulation quality racing... well, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is where it is.  Held WAY back by lack of a dynamic racing line, and an engine that likes nose dive trail braking more than it should."
I am a big fan of Codemasters' Dirt games so I thought I'd give their track based racing game a go. This game delivered everything I expected from playing their other games: it is quite realistic but not overly realistic which would compromise the fun and it looks good. The way you manage your team and sponsors is nice too. My only real complaint is the ending is rather anti-climatic. You get nothing for becoming the top driver or the most successful team and completing the last challenge just rolls the credits. Compared to Dirt 2 &amp; 3 this has a wider variety of cars and race types. However I'd still recommend the Dirt series as I prefer that type of motor sport.
"If you're looking for a realistic racing game, this probably isn't the game for you. But if you're looking for a fun racing game with interesitng physics and a variety of cool game modes, a classic arcade art style, this is probably the game you're looking for. The campaign is fun, and has a unique sponsoring system to gain credits. While later on in the game, certain sponsors get OP and you will end up getting more money than you'll ever need to spend, it's a fun mechanic becuase different sponsors will give you different benefits, and keep the game interesting. The sponsors are decals you put on your car before racing, advertising a company, and if you complete their requirements (ie: complete at least 2nd and under 40% damage to your car) they'll offer you something like an extra $20,000 (varies depending on sponsor) on top of your salary for winning. You can have a multitude of sponsors, and depending on how many of them you satisfy, you can make more than double what you would have made from just regularly placing. While this game is old, has successors, the original GRID in my mind is the most superior. It has it's flaws, and there's probably better games out there, but if you're into racing games GRID is a must have."
"I Dont like the physics.. thats about it. the physics are just a little overdone, like, the car seems exreemly light, and it causes you to get thrown around alot, and peaple are complianing about agressive AI, but the AI isnt aggresive, they just act like you are not there at all, unless they need to get around you, and i havnt played the game much either, but the career mode, just isnt fun, (although not having a racing wheel and pedals doesnt help XD) but go to the demolition derby mode, and screw around there, its really fun! and dont try to win the race, just race. like, if you feel like it, take out other cars, if you feel like it, drift your ♥♥♥ off, if you feel like it, kill your car, if you feel like it, cause a road block..   overall, if you are a hard core gamer, this is DEFINATELY NOT FOR YOU, but if you are a gamer that plays alot, but doesnt care if the game looks realistic (im talking to all you minecrafters), and you have 600 games in your steam library, but they are games like, Ruess, Tererria, The impossable game, yknow, not hardcore games, peaple like that would love this game. it is a casual game. and, even though i have like almost no games in my steam library, (just got steam a week ago as of this review) i am still a hardcore gamer, i still would play this game though, but only when i am really bored. and im talking REEEAALLY bored..   but until next time, this is Randomdeath5, sighning out.."
Great arcade racer. In some ways I like Grid 1 better than 2. Then again it might just be I favor money over the fan mechanic in 2 and like the car selection on 1 better than 2. But that's just me. Grapically the title still stands up.
Careful with Ravenwest lol.  also... Cockpit view FTW!!!
"Simply the best GRID game made so far ,new looks good but thats about it."
"Still a great game, Im playing it over again. 2015"
"Very well made game. In my opinion, this game was developed better and further than GRID 2. 10/10"
"Old but gold! The best racing game I've played so far. Codies made a masterpiece! The graphics are beautiful, the racing mechanics are pretty damn good and it's definitely a racing game worth buying."
One of the best racing games. Controling a car can be hard from start but in a while you get used to it.
i hightly recommond this game to anyone
"i came here for drifting, and Pagani Zonda R"
A superb classic and a beginning to a great installment. For all those who enjoy racing games - I highly recmmend the Grid. The game engine is interesting and combines several disceplines as you progress the game you will partake in those. I liked the amount of vehicles on offer and ability to buy second hand cars as well as new vehicles. The tracks are detailed and smooth and the car physics are easy to anticipate nad get used to. This game delivers smooth racing experience that keep the end user interested for hours! Happy racing :)
"Gameplay:  Great . Restart simulator. Kidding aside, it might take a longer time than usual to get used to the controls, but when you do, prepare yourself for some fun. Modes are very polished. Does little in the way of customization, but for me, that's not an issue. One of the best racing games out there, easily outrivaling most racing games eight years it's junior.  Replayability:  Good . Offers a lot of tracks, a lot of cars, lots of modes, all without the grinding required from most racing games. Can get addictive at some stretches.  Audio:  Neutral . Hit and miss. Engine sounds, the intricate sounds are nice, but the soundtrack and background audio definitely isn't a strong suit.   Graphics:  Great . Insanely good-looking. Hard to believe this is a game from 2007. CAr damage visuals can get unrealistic at some points though.  Technicals:  Neutral : Supports most controllers, minor technical issues such as VRAM optimization is a letdown (can easily overheat most modern laptops out there, so beware), and no windoweed option. Encountered gamebreaking framerate lapses but on rare occasions only."
The amount of times it'll take you to restart race until you learn how to properly drive is what makes this game the best.    Also best 3 USD I ever wasted.
GRID is probably my favourite racing game of all time. I have very much enjoyed playing through it (I have more hours than steam says I do) and would willingly do so again.    Pros:
"This game is aged very well My first play time was 7 years ago, at that time I'm using dual core AMD4400+/Celeron E1200 + HD 4670 + 2GB RAM, those machines was great gaming champ back then (and probably still ok playing most of these steam games) Game ran great, even though I can't max the setting, the graphic was amazing.  Now I have better rig, still not the best at least more powerful than my older rig, I can max everything, running so smooth with 60fps  everytime someone mention a racing game on their consoles and bragging about graphic quality on 2015? I just baffled and link them a youtube video.  I mean cmon, this game was released on 2008, and it still comparable with racing game nowdays. and since my disk is missing somewhere, spending $2 again for a game that I love will not kill me.  it's $2 on sale you can get GRID, GRID 2, and GRID Autosport and it still less expensive than Forsa/Grand Tourismo/Need For Speed (if consoles is your thing)"
Loved this game on 360 so i got it on steam. Not mad about the purchase. Looks and plays better than most current racers.
One of my favourite racing games!
this game is great its so realistick
Really good driving game. Takes a bit of practice though. 
"One of the best racing games of the new generation. Amazing graphics for that time which didn't use a lot of resources. I remember having tried this game when it first came out with a sh*tty computer and it ran flawlessly. I own all GRiD games and I still play this one once in a while. Long carreer mode, lots of cars. Only thing I don't like is that there's only a range of cars to choose for every event, the rest of the game is simply amazing."
"WROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!  Great racing game, it's a mix of arcade and simulator (but more arcade for me). Better and fresh version of Toca Race Driver 3. Cars are extremely beautiful &lt;33  Don't drink and drive xddd 9/10"
Sweet Game shame no severs left :*(
"A real fun racer. Exciting, visceral and good looking. Must use controller!"
Old game but still good fun. I enjoyed it
Nice game! good for low-spec laptop
This is easily one of the best racers I've ever played. Check it out with Xbox360 controller - you'll be amazed how well this feels.
"Great game! IGameplay can be modified to be relatively easily playable, or ridiculously realistic and, genuinely, extremely hard. Great racing game overall, especially for the price; totally worth it! :D"
"This Game is actually pretty decent, but fun to play, but now you cant play multiplayer anymore, because the servers had been shut down.   But it is a still good playable game.   I recommend you buy it since it has cool minigames."
"There's not much to say about this racing title other than It's a lot of fun! The vehicles are fully tune-able and handle very well. The graphics are great, the soundtrack is powerful and does well in creating a feeling of tension as you're neck-and-neck for first place on the last lap. The boss races (against Ravenwest) are always intense. The special soundtracks that play specifically for those races make it even more so.  There's a variety of different cars to drive. Classic muscle cars, Formula cars, Italian supercars, and demolition derby races.  You're able to choose your name or nickname (from a list) and you'll hear your name being announced, which adds to the immersion. There's a real sense of accomplishment when you finally start moving up in the ranks, start beating Ravenwest, and go from a small dim garage to a much sleeker, bigger garage with a different soundtrack.  When that happened I sat there for a few minutes just thinking 'I finally did it!'  Only downside is there's no multiplayer. It got shut down."
"Spent lots of time when I was younger playing the non-steam version of this.   + You can create your own team with custom liveries.  + Hire and Fire Teammates who all have different skills.  + 3 Regions (Europe, North America &amp; Asia) with different race types.  + Career mode progresses as you start from the bottom and reach the international stages, rising through the ranks.  + Pretty interesting that you can buy cars new or from Ebay.  + Ravenwest team are your rivals throughout the game that sometimes challenge you to 1v1 races.  For the money it's a really good game. I'd recommend you download the Dargos Realism Modpack which removes the yellow filter and makes the game look much nicer. Also if you have completed the game already and want a challenge, install Broski's Updated GRID modpack which increases the difficulty of the AI as well as other career mode improvements/changes."
If buying for multiplayer then  PASS!    After all these years this game is still amazing! I haven't played Autosport but I have played Grid 2 and compared to that this is  WAY BETTER!      PRO'S
Awesome racing game!
"i came here for drifting, and Pagani Zonda R"
The original and the best. The customisation of the cars is a little less deep than the following games but the DORIFTO comes stock and that's a win.
This game may be older but the arcade racing and drifting action is timeless. Can usually get it for relatively cheap during deals.
Great game good graphics good fisics etc
"Good old racing game. Insane crashing physics, and really exciting gameplay. This is probably one of the best racing games ever made even today. It's almost 9 years old, but graphics are still insane."
"Simply put one of the best modern day racing games there is. But i would highly recommend you getting this game on a console where it belongs according to me. If you like driving games there really is no excuse not to get this one, especially considering how low the price is at most retailer stores."
"Positive: -Really nice all-round arcadish game. It's desined for casuals imo, but can be setup to be fairly challenging/realistic. -The menu looks nice, and it's easy-to-use. -Gameplay is cool - carrier mode is entertaining -, cca 20-25 hours worth of variety. Completing the game though takes more than twice this time - calculation based on my progress -  Negative: -After every single race you have to watch how you did in the sponsorship challanges. Because of this, restarting a race after finishing it takes cca. 20 seconds, which can get extremly annoying after 3-4 consequent tries. -Too much camerashake and loud impactsounds during the listing of winnings / sponsorships. -Replay system is quite basic - no save, no option to hide overlay for recording purposes, no roundbased skip only fastforward-. -Drift scoresytem is weird, sometimes you get points for understeer slide, sometimes you get 0 for perfect drift.  About the ridiculous assists: -If you use keyboard, traction control is not an option, it's a MUST. Drift challanges are impossible with keyboard! -Stability control OFF means almost no front grip. ON setting makes the cars handle like they should.  More about Stability control: With OFF setting: AI will laugh at you in any corner. In addition they can push you out, but you cant do the same to them. Recommended if you like unfair challanges. With ON setting: It makes your RWD car handle like it should realistically with mild stability control. With this assist you can drive circles around the AI on higher difficulty levels."
"This is a phenomenal game. I truly enjoyed playing through it, more than I have most other racing games that I've played. The controls felt really smooth, the cars handles well - and differently from each other. There were some that would stay stable and take some abuse, and others that would completely lose control if one of your opponents so much as looked at you funny. But overall, as long as you weren't running into everything you saw, the game handled just fine. The graphics are also quite good, if it has the old 'reality is brown!' trope to it. The cars can take damage, and get banged up and dirty (or, rather, scraped up). They can flip, though the undersides aren't detailed. There's a decent selection of cars, tracks seem more limited.  The single player game mode plays fairly well. Sets of tournaments, need to earn reputation to unlock higher events. You earn a bulk of your money through sponsors, that ask for certain conditions to be met. Take note that 'no damage' means no mechanical damage, none of your components damaged. You can bang up your body work and they don't care. You'll even be able to unlock a second driver for you as you work up the races, though they will be driving a duplicate car of your own (so you don't need to buy extras for them). As for the AI, that might be my favorite part of this game. Instead of simply following racing lines, they are actual AI. They WANT to stay on the racing lines, obviously, and will occasionally knock you out of the way if they want to be where you are, but they can also make mistakes. Every now and then you'll see one miss a turn and hit a barrier, or spin out. They also have varying skill levels, with one particular driving team being massively ahead of everyone else. That team will push you, challenge you, frustrate you, but they can be beaten. Once you've completed all the events in one section, you'll get a special head to head with the aforementioned rival team. These usually offer some very good pay outs.  The game is also a bit forgiving. You have a set number of 'flashbacks', where you can rewind time a little bit if you've made a mistake. You can also restart the race if necessary. However, these can both be disabled by playing in 'Pro' mode, so the game will offer the level of challenge that you want to face. None of the races are paricularly long. Even the frequent Le Mans 24 hour race is condenced into 12 minutes.  All in all, I truly enjoyed this game, and highly recommend it to anyone that likes racing games, particularly given the price. Though, I will note, that this game has been available very cheap in various 'bundles' you can find elsewhere. So if you want to try to save a few dollars, wait until you see it on one of those deals and pick up a real steal. Or wait for it to go on sale here."
"Hands down the best all around street driving game. 1/3 Sim, 1/3 Arcade, and 1/3 Adrenalin go into the gameplay dynamics of this must have for all digital race drivers."
Fun racing game! Physics are pretty realistic and mild skill is required!
The greatest simcade there is. Varied driving with some amazing tracks. Must buy for the casual racer.
great game
pretty neat.
Hella fun.  I've shaved five minutes off my commute.
Do you like cars? Yes: Buy this game.  No: Buy this game.    
"GRID is great. It's definitely an older title, as you will be able to tell by the fact it doesn't run in 1080p, but the mechanics are still excellent and entertaining. It's a nice blend of simulation and arcade, and satisfies any need for speed you might have."
"I just had to come back and write this review; because eight years later after release, this game still holds up. (Don't mind what it says about my playtime, I have more hours on console)  Story: You play as a racer that is trying to build up your reputition to start your own racing-team (which you can fully customize wíth sponsors and various other options). To do so, you must first earn some cash by racing for other existing big-name-teams.  Gameplay: The racing is very aggressive and realistic at the same time. NPC's can actually crash themselves and cause accidents on track. It's not your typical arcade-racer but it's not your typical racing-simulator either. Instead, the racing-mechanics are like a hybrid between those two. (It's made for people that just want to relax with a 'simulator' without the need to worry about those overly complex mechanics that simulators have).  Cons: Because it's an old game, it's needs some fixing before you can play it with your modern setup. For me, I had to into the game files and edit a restriciton to be able to play at 1080p. Link: &gt;  https://joshmccarty.com/2013/08/enable-higher-resolutions-for-grid-on-pc/  &lt;. Other than that there aren't really many cons.  Summary: A very realistic racing experience overall for players that doesn't want to get too technical. (It can also run pretty well on weaker computers/laptops)."
"If you can get this on sale for a good price, BUY IT!"
"Meh, limited cars graphics look good game runs nicely AI is annoyingly aggressive. Game is fun if you can survive the first lap without being totaled by AI  "
very very nice game..still has a little little problem when the car stops in the middle of the race(completely stops) and after you turn the engine on it drifts too much and you start very late..but it is an allrounded racing game! i recomend this game but not at 13 euro(i got the game on sale &lt;2.5 or 5 euro&gt;)
"I recommend this game only if you can get it very cheap!  It's fun and fast in the beginning, graphics are very good (for me at least). However the more you progress you notice more and more that the AI is blatantly cheating. The racing, which has a very arcade feel to me, is not the problem, the other cars/AI is.  You usually start somewhere in the middle/end of the pack. Best way to bybass the other cars in the beginning is to just crash into them (you car can take a lot of damage...). If you could just qualify for a track/position it would be more fun and as bonus you would get to know the track before you actually have to race it.  The big problem I have is that you cannot build up an advantage, the AI cars will suddenly be right behind you when 2 corners ago they were nowhere in sight, might make it more exciting but then they suddenly can take corners which would leave your car spinning of the track.  TLDR: get it cheap and enjoy it for a while!  "
"Well, it suddenly works, what do you know. So I'm changing this review to recommended. It is the best grid game, still looking fine and has several camera modes including cockpit view for fun immersion and added challenge. It manages a fine balance between arcade and simulation and is actually quite tricky. It is much better, faster, crazier, more fun than NFS drift. It is the best game still in this type of game and you can pick it up without being a racing-nerd, but still going a little deeper. There is little customization, and more focus on driving, quite a lot of different cars on different tracks. You'll get a lot out of this one. It works fine without controller/wheel but makes it more fun with those. Highly recommended.  Here is what I wrote before:  'Love this game. But could not get it to work properly on Windows 10. It started alright, but had weird graphical glitches, for example no road. I tried a ton of various suggestions and fixed to no avail. Sorry, it is a good game and runs a like butter, but like this, it s not acceptable. So no if you have windows 10'"
"Grid is a fun game i have way more than only 1.1 hours on there im not sure why it walnt update. But thats a minor problem.  This game is a bridge of the gap thats between the all out mayhem racing of need for speed, and the track racing from somthing like grand torismo or forza motorsports. And i have to say its fun more so than i expected and for the age of this game is still looks amazing though you have to go through a config file to get it to run 1080p but its worth the small hassle.  the racing itself reminds me of need for speed the way the cars handle and stuff but they are just on a track all the time while nfs only has track event some of the time  overall a great game for when i got it at the summer sale for a whole dollar totally worth"
"Hands down the best racing game i have ever played. When i first played it years ago the first thing that caught my eye was the amazing graphics and still today the graphics hold up pretty much second to none.  If you enjoy racing games and have yet to get stuck into GRID then shame on you, definitely give it a whirl!"
"I still play this today, keep coming back to it. Few other games capture the essence of starting with nothing and working your way up to create something. Races are exciting and visceral. And it still looks great.   Shame the rest of the series gave you free cars, etc. This is the pinnacle of the series, went backwards from here in my opinion."
"Good old racing game. Insane crashing physics, and really exciting gameplay. This is probably one of the best racing games ever made even today. It's almost 9 years old, but graphics are still insane."
Graphically superb despite being an older game. Shame I crash all the time.
This is the greatest Initial D game of all time.
"Loved Grid straight away when i first bought it for my ps3 and i have to say the graphics still look great on my high end pc. Great Racer, cars feel good"
Careful with Ravenwest lol.  also... Cockpit view FTW!!!

"Only disappointment is drift (sucks)  And drift cars are only available for the stupid drift competitions. Everything else is great what can I say, I got it for 2.99 :') "
Great game good graphics good fisics etc
Great gmae suck there is no longer online servers to play on as single player once done that it may as well delete local content
:))
"Arcade and Simulation 6:3 or 7:3...? :) but racing game content is very good... specially, touge race, street circuit... i like it.  p.s Doesn't work online... :( server is dead...??"
I recommend its pretty cool.
"Safe to say this game is screenshot worthy. Trust me, you'll be taking plenty of them."
This game may be older but the arcade racing and drifting action is timeless. Can usually get it for relatively cheap during deals.
"There are very few games that can captivate you through their immersiveness. GRID is one of those games, the career mode is excellent, plenty of options to unlock liecenses and new vehicles, 30 hours in the game and I am still not bored, I would highly recommend this game to those who likes the whole arcade experience with amazing graphics, excellent gameplay and plenty of cars to choose from, GRID is a classic and will go down a long way in the histoy. I hope EA learns something from CodeMasters."
GRID is probably my favourite racing game of all time. I have very much enjoyed playing through it (I have more hours than steam says I do) and would willingly do so again.    Pros:
"It's a very very nice game despite being a 2008 game, it's very fun. The physics are good and the A.I is also nice. The graphics are cool, the models are very detailed.  Overall, GRID is a very fun game, a mix between arcade and simulation."
'Is this the best £1.99 you ever spent?' Yes.  'Why?' The tyre walls have physics  10/10 would crash again
"One of the best Racing games, well balanced, mix of arcade/sim... nice graphics, and quite a range of racing disciplines"
"Hi,  The game seems to be good...but I cannot play on-line, it keeps saying that 'there was an error when creating account...'  Any ideas?  Thanks!"
The greatest simcade there is. Varied driving with some amazing tracks. Must buy for the casual racer.
great game
nice graphics and a lot of Fun especially when another car crashing to wall ☺
"Used to play this game alot on PS3, I loved the drifting. Just bought during Sega's mass sale for $3. It's too bad I don't have an old PS3 controller and my 360 Controller has trouble turning on when I plug it into my PC. I sometimes have to plug/unplug some 10,000 times before the green light decides to turn on. So I'm stuck using the keyboard for now and it's a definte no no for drifting."
"Good game overall for a game made 8 years ago now. To be completely honest though i would rather recommend Autosport rather than this, the first installment of the Grid franchise unless your PC is a lower tier. Good game to just muck about with a bunch of cars though."
"helmet view --&gt; check No prevention of wheel lock --&gt; check No prevention of understeer --&gt; check Realistic crash mechanism --&gt; check  Readied my crash dummy helmet, as I have just created major race crash in yet another race. Now I know why I am not a racing driver in real life."
"Grid is a good compliment to the arcade style of race games. The handling and controls are not like the 'real style' driving sims which i find sometimes annoying because really, its just a game and should be played as such."
"This is one of those games where if you brake slightly out of time, you'll need to restart the race."
"Hands down the best all around street driving game. 1/3 Sim, 1/3 Arcade, and 1/3 Adrenalin go into the gameplay dynamics of this must have for all digital race drivers."
Best £1.99 I've ever spent on a racing game on Steam. Also you can download off the Internet the 2 DLCs as featured on Xbox and Playstation right into the Steam version folder. Works great. :D
"Great game! IGameplay can be modified to be relatively easily playable, or ridiculously realistic and, genuinely, extremely hard. Great racing game overall, especially for the price; totally worth it! :D"
This game is great fun.
The greatest simcade there is. Varied driving with some amazing tracks. Must buy for the casual racer.
Very good arcade racing game there. i recommend to get this game.   Rate: 8.9/10  Pros  Fun good amonut of cars to chose  Cons  the grass are ice so dont drive on it Ai meh crashing phyics questionable
I have found out 3 things whilst playing this game. 1: I am pretty darn good at driving. 2: Don't try ad bash other cars out of the way. 3: don't drive on the dirt. You will spin the hell out. It's a great racing game. It's a lot stronger than most others out there so give this a try!
"A bit repetitive, but above average driving simulator. It has cool aspects like creating you'r own racing team, getting sponsorhip from all the big names, drift events that make you feel like a beast, and a true lifesaver in the form of a flashback feature.  6/10"
"Safe to say this game is screenshot worthy. Trust me, you'll be taking plenty of them."
Careful with Ravenwest lol.  also... Cockpit view FTW!!!
"Good old racing game. Insane crashing physics, and really exciting gameplay. This is probably one of the best racing games ever made even today. It's almost 9 years old, but graphics are still insane."
"Had the dvd retail edition for many years, but just got the steam one off GRID2 pre-order, and I can honestly say this is STILL one of the best driving games on any format despite it's age, the main things that are starting to look a bit dated are the handling (bit lightweight compared to newer codie titles) and the lack of weather."
If you love racing of all types this game is for you. You can race any style you want in Race Day or go for getting a team together for wripping out the the other teams. To become the highest points driver. THIS STEAM VERSION GAME RUNS ON WINDOWS 10.
I found it quite hard to play this game because the controls and the dynamics of it are so life like. Unlike NFS and other games where you just hold the accelerate button even when cornering in this game doing something like that can be a game ender. Great gameplay and the fun keeps on growing. 
"This is my favorite racing game. The graphics are beautiful and not cartoony. I run this game at max settings for everything and it runs really good. Only LAN available now but, single player mode is incredibly fun. The price now is amazing. I paid full price for it when it first came out and it was worth it. Took a little bit to get used to the handling of the cars but once I did was alot of fun."
24 de Le Mans is the best demolition racing of the game. Muscle cars are monsters unable to make turns. AI players are aggressive suicidal dumbasses. If you can finish a race without using flashbacks (rewind feature) you are a badass player.  The racing events are exciting. Cars are beautiful. The game can run on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop. GRID is one of the best semi-simulation racing games I played. I strongly recommend. 10/10
:))
nice graphics and a lot of Fun especially when another car crashing to wall ☺
Best on-road racer yet.
"Game came out in 2007 and still to this day I constantly play this game! Lookng for a fun racing game that mixes sim/arcade well, then this game is for you!"
14 hrs in the game and I can afford a million dollar car.

"Really good fusion of Simulation and Arcade style physics, with a great carrer mode"
  Pretty nostalgic when GRID has cockpit detailed view. Good game btw :)
Best on-road racer yet.
14 hrs in the game and I can afford a million dollar car.
"The graphics and realism are amazing, but if you're like me and want an option to turn off the damage element or look at the car specs to compare between rides, you're going to have a bad time. This is great for people who just want to pretent they are real life race car drivers. No elements of arcade style racing or customization of the races themselves. Pick a track, pick a car, that's it. If you have a huge screen you can choose a paint job but it's hard to make out on a PC monitor."
An overall decent game. Pros:  -Good graphics   -Somewhat decent physics  -Tracks are well replicated   -Replay feature is quite handy  -Has LAN multiplayer  Cons:  -Maximum resolution is 720p  -Bloom is a little excessive  -No online multiplayer  -Does not run very well on low end hardware
"Hands down best in the series, and for a long time the best racing game/sim available on steam."
A decent driving game on the easier settings with an Xbox controller. The stock car races are my favorite. A variety of styles of driving which are a bit of a mixed bag for me. 7.5/10.
"Played a lot of GRID on xbox 360, picked this up on sale for the memories and was plesantly surprised that the graphics and A.I. hold up agains the test of time. Easily one of the best racing games of all time. 11/10"
"This game is OK. Not realistic by any means, but not a bad racer for PC."
the handling is &lt;3
pretty neat.
best racing game its realistic and fun you should buy this and the damage is just outrageous sponser liveries has Le mans and the 24hour one too you can select how many mins or hours its a great buy if you have a thing for racing and if you know how to play racing games go for it

Nice game! good for low-spec laptop
This is easily one of the best racers I've ever played. Check it out with Xbox360 controller - you'll be amazed how well this feels.
One of the best arcade racing games I have ever played.   10/10 would rewind again.
"Played a lot of GRID on xbox 360, picked this up on sale for the memories and was plesantly surprised that the graphics and A.I. hold up agains the test of time. Easily one of the best racing games of all time. 11/10"
Old game but still good fun. I enjoyed it
still better than newer game these days
"One of my absolute favorite race games, the physics are close to real but still playable. its nice as well on multiplayermode with friends."
No modern racing game can stand up to the simplicity of this one. An easy purchase
As for me - best racing game ever! Haven't had that much fun since the first Underground game. Playd like 100H before buying steam version.
"PROS -Great graphics, especially for a nearly 10 year old game. -Nice selection of cars and race types, there's always something for everyone. -Difficulty is nicely balanced, provides a good challenge without being frustrating.   CONS -Not necessarily a con, but I highly recommend using a controller for this game, as the standard keyboard controls are a bit difficult to use"
its a very good game
i love the drifting in the game once u are good at drifting u never wanna race again. the graphics are really good still considering the game came out in 2008 and the physics are pretty good. 10/10
"keyboard not recommended to play this game, everything else is just perfect."
"Good game, but extremely hard to play if you don't have a gamepad."
Played this game on console when first released. Good game with great gameplay. The pc version runs at 720p not 1080. If you can get through that you'll enjoy this game.
"For an 07 racing game, the graphics are fairly decent and the variety is fairly good. Has a few game modes and a good range of difficulty, physics although way off suit the cartoony feel to the game."
"EXTREMELY frustrating game.  If you're not already a race car afficianado, and you're not naturally good at these games, AND you are put off by repetitive frustration, this game may be not much fun for you.  I am giving it a thumbs up because I just cannot stand repetitive frustration, but the game itself feels good otherwise."
"Yes its a really nice game. Its realistic and etc etc... but if you think you are driving bad cuz ur new, you are wrong. Bots are just worse...just crashing to eachother, difficulty doesnt matter...if ur in the middle when the race is starting, well, ur just pretty much f***ed cuz they wont let you out... the bots will crash inot u several times...its horrible"
"Picked this up for $3.75 during the Steam Summer Sale and it was a damn good deal. Even though the game came out in 2008 its graphics rival a lot of modern titles still.  When GRID first came out it apparently set a benchmark for the genre, and its easy to see why: the cars, of which there are many, handle in such different ways that every different kind of car is a new challenge in and of itself; the racing world is very well designed -- you pick up sponsors, hire teammates, win prize money, develop rivalries with other drivers, etc; and there are lots of different racing events, ranging from US circuits like Classic Muscle, Demolition Derby to Japanese circuits like Pro Tougai (though I have to say, the announcer kinda makes it sound like he's saying 'proto-gay,' whatever THAT'S supposed to mean).  Unfortunately, Codemasters never renewed its online server license for this game so multiplayer is effectively dead. You can stil play with friends, however, with the help of Gameranger."
"A real fun racer. Exciting, visceral and good looking. Must use controller!"
"When I'm bored of NFS, I jump to this. This game is beautiful even with low settings. Get it cos it's one of those racing games that are tough but you can still enjoy!"
As for me - best racing game ever! Haven't had that much fun since the first Underground game. Playd like 100H before buying steam version.
"Well, it suddenly works, what do you know. So I'm changing this review to recommended. It is the best grid game, still looking fine and has several camera modes including cockpit view for fun immersion and added challenge. It manages a fine balance between arcade and simulation and is actually quite tricky. It is much better, faster, crazier, more fun than NFS drift. It is the best game still in this type of game and you can pick it up without being a racing-nerd, but still going a little deeper. There is little customization, and more focus on driving, quite a lot of different cars on different tracks. You'll get a lot out of this one. It works fine without controller/wheel but makes it more fun with those. Highly recommended.  Here is what I wrote before:  'Love this game. But could not get it to work properly on Windows 10. It started alright, but had weird graphical glitches, for example no road. I tried a ton of various suggestions and fixed to no avail. Sorry, it is a good game and runs a like butter, but like this, it s not acceptable. So no if you have windows 10'"
"There's not much to say about this racing title other than It's a lot of fun! The vehicles are fully tune-able and handle very well. The graphics are great, the soundtrack is powerful and does well in creating a feeling of tension as you're neck-and-neck for first place on the last lap. The boss races (against Ravenwest) are always intense. The special soundtracks that play specifically for those races make it even more so.  There's a variety of different cars to drive. Classic muscle cars, Formula cars, Italian supercars, and demolition derby races.  You're able to choose your name or nickname (from a list) and you'll hear your name being announced, which adds to the immersion. There's a real sense of accomplishment when you finally start moving up in the ranks, start beating Ravenwest, and go from a small dim garage to a much sleeker, bigger garage with a different soundtrack.  When that happened I sat there for a few minutes just thinking 'I finally did it!'  Only downside is there's no multiplayer. It got shut down."
i love the drifting in the game once u are good at drifting u never wanna race again. the graphics are really good still considering the game came out in 2008 and the physics are pretty good. 10/10
"Good game, but extremely hard to play if you don't have a gamepad."
"keyboard not recommended to play this game, everything else is just perfect."
"Yes its a really nice game. Its realistic and etc etc... but if you think you are driving bad cuz ur new, you are wrong.

One of the best racing sims I've played. Only flaw is wishing i could update the car list
realistic not more
Very fun game with great tracks and cars. Ver realistic type of racing game allowing you to get sponsors!
better than Need for Speed and this came out 8 years ago.
"If this game was a potato, it would be a good potato."
Becoming a classic in my library.
  One of the best car games in my opinion. But I would buy the newer game because of the graphics.
"Still the best racing game I've ever played in my life. Controls feel real, damage to a car is real. One of the best, if not the best drifting mode I've ever seen."
"Some games are fine-tuned just so, and simply feel right. I have played this game much more than my hours count suggests, always with friends taking turns at the joypad. I don't particularly enjoy this type of game, but this, and not any other game in this series, really does it for me, and I have on more than one occasion met other people expressing the same sentiment.  And graphics haven't really moved much in the last years, as you know -- so it still looks pretty decent.  Buy it, it costs nothing!"
"At first I didn't realize the game was a serious racing game, imagining it to be something like NFS. Immediately I found how wrong I was.  I thought I was going to hate the game based on how realistic it (successfully) tried to be, but I found myself playing it more and more.  If you like racing games, even games like NFS, you'll come to love this game."
psst... psst.. wanna buy some drifting?

"Probably the greatest arcade/sim racer mashup Codies, or any other developer, has released. It still holds up to the newer games with ease. And despite the online servers being shut down for several years now, much fun can be had in 3rd party LAN emulator lobbies :)"
" GRiD  is a solid arcade style racer with light team management aspects that plays well in spaces Gran Turismo and Project Gotham created.   Pros:  +A great feeling racer. Older and heavier cars have a great sense of weight and skid in corners, light cars jostle as you would expect over minor bumps. Each has a unique feel that match what I expected. +For a game getting close to 10 years old, it still looks pretty darn good! +Lots of team creativity. You have huge pools of potential team mates, can choose coordinating team paint schemes, choose sponsorships on a nifty risk/reward system. It's not deep but it can be very satisfying. +A solid selection of cars to chose from, many dream cars without much filler. +The time rewind feature is a great tool to have in your back pocket, if nothing else to calm down murderous rogue A.I.   Cons:  -No tuning. I understand this is an arcade racer but even some slight modification options such as tires would have been nice. -A.I. is usually competent but when they get a little confused things can go off the rails really quickly. This includes your teammate trying to wreck you out of first place sometimes. -24hrs of Le Mans gets boring after the 3rd or so time, quit pushing us to race it all the time.   Meh:  =Not much music. It doesn't need a 60 song pop hits juke box but a little something extra would have been nice. =Voice acting is all over the place. Ranges from robust (pit chief) to mechanical (manager) to cringy (white guys doing foreign accents) =Drifting segments do not feel terribly fleshed out and the drift detection seems inconsistent. Project Gotham nailed this early on so that's disappointing to see.  Overall  GRiD  is certainly one of the better options for fun arcade racing on PC. While an older title it still manages to provide an entertaining race experience."
"Still holds up as one of the greats, not to many ricers, old school muscle cars have more in the game reasons than just drop in after thoughts like the sequels. It might not be the most SIMULATION out there for some folks, but just my favorite racer ever using a gamepad. I still remember having it on an xbox 360 so when friends came over in 2008 and dealing with the screen stutter before the patches and showing it off on PC with allt he great graphics at the time that still 7 years later hold up well."
I have been playing this since D2D many many years ago. Bought it for STEAM (it was $3) in all I have many hundreds of hrs racked up in game. I still find it very fun and an easy recommend. Old PC (Not a Problem)  If you have a Gpu ithink with 4GB or more all you have to do is delete 2 files and edit and delete all in another file.  Easy Peasy  3rd comment down is the fix  http://steamcommunity.com/app/12750/discussions/0/343787920137804099/   Win 7 x64 8GB RAM AMD 1090t x6 @3.8mhz RX 480 8G Strix (overkill for the game) HD5870 worked beautify for 6 years. heck even the HD3850 did I think.

"This game, let me tell you... Is straight up amazing. I played this game through so many times, I remember my dad buying the game when I was little, really little, and watched him all the time. I started playing it as I got older, and played it through at least three times on PS3, Now, in 2016, the game being ten years old, still catches me, great graphics, great AI, and great and fun physics. It is fun to mess around on tracks, and figure out new ways around. I played it through in about twenty hours, so great fun, but after that you can mess around in race day, crash into the AI, and do a lot of crazy stuff still. 10/10. And great childhood memories."
Still to date one of the best entry-level racing sims.
The best track racing game ever  10/10 Literally no problems with the game
"this game is a timeless legend.a masterpiece that has its place on the top of mount olympia,and very doubtfull for it to be replaced by any other racing game during my lifetime."
"If this game was a potato, it would be a good potato."
Worth it for destruction derby alone
One of my favorite racing games ever. was mind blowing at it's time. And still not a bad game to play if you want some fun challenge. good mix between arcade and sim in more 'arcadey' way. )))
this game really good.
I really liked this game.It is a little old and the graphics still look good.It even has Windows 10 support unlike Street Legal Redline Racing.This game has a wide variety of race cars.You can even start your own Racing Team.This game is very great today like it was when it first came out.I only disliked the Download takes like 90 minutes.And this game is a little too adictive.

"The AI gets god mode and major rubber banding.  You'll find the blatant AI cheating will leave you with a case of road rage. Don't know how many times I've been really far ahead of the pact only to find the AI cars suddenly being able to hold corners that would leave you in the fence and catching up and passing a few feet from the finish line. The only way to ever start a race at pole position is to buy the Audi R10 for the La mans race. So prepare to always start at the back or middle of the line up. The only way to pass is to treat every race like a crash derby. First corner aim for the middle of the pact.  Uninstalled and walked away.  Reinstalled, Little nephew likes crashing the cars. Funny thing. He slammed a ravenwest AI car into a wall at over a hundred mph and flipped it several times and it still managed to come in 2nd..... Also something he noticed that I did not. The turning point for the car in the higher races. Is Not the front tires but some point near the middle of the car. Makes control a lot harder."
"If you value your things, stay far away from this frustrating game. I swear the AI are programmed to be complete idiots, when they crash, they must do it in front of you just far enough away so they have time to back up right when you get to them causing you to crash, while your tires are smoking and you are sliding around a corner they are going around it 100 mph faster than you without spinning a single tire. This game is so full annoying little things that make me insane, i said i was going to quit playing last night after i broke my keyboard, but now after punching my 2nd monitor i finally uninstalled this trash.  If you see this game coming at you while walking down the street, i suggest crossing the stree and walking on the other side, if you see this game crossing the street while you are driving, hit with your car, then back up and hit it again. I would rather take an arrow to the knee than EVER play this game again.   But if you enjoy playing angry and smashing into people, and destroying nice cars...then carry on."
"OMG @ that car handling, it feels like you are driving while being drunk. You constantly have to do steering corrections just to stay in a straight line. Even the slightest tap left/right makes the car agressively turn and drift (even after playing with the sensetivity settings) which you again have to correct and then over-correct. Anyway, you will be wobbeling all over the place during the races. Also the AI drives as if you don't exist on the road, they crash full speed into you like you are not there.  I will have to refund this cos even at 80% off it's not worth it.  The ones giving the review a thumbs down probably haven't played the game on PC cos It was one of the worst controls and handling I have encountered in a race game. The game has decent graphics and nice tracks, but it's pointless when you have car handling and controls like that."
 An arcadish racing simulator with the aptitude to have a lot of 'turning' points.
multiplayer not working :(
a complete clusterf*ck of steering physics
GRID is an arcade game with few simulation features. It doesn't feel balanced on the track. The steering is just too squishy and doesn't have much of an impact.
"No practice racing. Why in the hell would you not have practice races? I have never played a Grid game and am relatively new to racing game genre in general. So when I boot up your game and find that there is no way for me to learn the physics of the game, no way for me to learn how the drifts work, no way for me to figure out anything. I want to like this game but I am frustrated already, I already had to restart the first race like 10 times. Seriously, ADD PRACTICE RACES OR A PRACTICE MODE. I want to like this game, I really do, I love the way the car controls but SOAB I should be able to learn on my own."
"if, and really IF you like ridge racer handling with an extra wtf in it, you will like this. it feels like a slow game put in X2 speed, controls included. in other words it feels average fast and behaves like a gremlin. would not be an issue if cars behaved differently.. or if the ♥♥♥♥ING camera did not move on it own when you go sideways.."
"The controls are pretty bad, and the cars themselves are very floaty.  Have fun trying to take a turn above fifty miles per hour, in anything. Chances are you'll spin out about twenty times, and still manage to get stuck."
don't buy this game the steering is way too sensitive
"I like that it plays more like arcade racing.   But it feels centered around unlocking things, rather than being fun and accessible."
"This game is horrible, mainly the majorly inadequate steering controls and since it is a racing game so steering is rather important. It is worth .99 but nothing more."

The game has decent graphics and nice tracks, but it's pointless when you have car handling and controls like that."
"This game is on my top10 of games.. on a console. As my playtime reflects, I haven't tried this version out much, but knowing how the game is/acts/behaves on a console I feel I've tried enough to make a comparison of the two.  I'm using Win10, and used a wired PS3 controller (No BT dongle, sadly) and I didn't have any issues running the game, or getting the controls to work. However this might not be the case for you, as others have pointed out having issues running the game on Win10.  I really wanted to like this version/port, but I simply couldn't. Try it out, and ask for a refund if it's not to your liking."
"When it comes to graphics, I know I should keep in mind its an old game, but still NO.  Even the gameplay is stupid, when u play on Basic difficulty its super easy, while 'Normal' &amp; 'Serious' are both the same.  In general, If you drifted away from the main road and just touched the grass or the sand on the sides, then u r in hell, the cars keep spinning around like crazy, u can't get it out easily and even there's no reset button.  Instead of the reset button, the game has the option to replay the last few seconds and proceed the race anytime during these seconds, but even if u hit the wall and want to replay, it only gets u like a second or 2 before u hit the wall, which u can't do anything to avoid the hit.  Well, I only got it for 3 $ and thought what the hell, I never played any of the GRID series, so I usually like to start from the begining, but it sucks, I'm actually considering not to try the newer ones. So don't get it even if it's for free and don't wast your time with it."
Gameplay is rather bland. the Drift aspects of this game are what make it the most fun IMO. However... I had purchased this game with the intent to play online and hopefully have something to make up for not having such awesome games like Forza and Gran Turismo. MULTIPLAYER DOESNT WORK.   Good try for an arcade style racing game. Lets just hope they polished it up with Grid 2
"The AI will recklessly crash into you and drive you off the road.  If one tenth of an inch of your tire touches grass, you'll instantly start spinning like a top.  DEFINITELY get a racing wheel or controller if you want to play this, the drift and indy car races are next to impossible without one.  Engine sounds are very bland and samey. Not what I would expect from a game in this day and age.  Acceleration is like a rocket car instead of an actual car.  Car selection is fairly small."
"I wanted to like it, I really did. Even today the car selection is quite interesting and the graphics are decent enough. But I honestly feel I should've spent my money on a burger and fries. The game is awful, period. Phyiscs are awfully unrealistic and too serious for what an arcade game should be but, mind you, it's no rFactor. Playing with a keyboard is absurdely frustrating and just spoils the fun. Steering wheel? Yes, I got one, but it's not worth going through the trouble of setting it up for what's supposed to be a fun game, if I want to use my G27 I just play R3E or any older SimBin sim. THAT is realistic.  All I wanted was a fun, engaging arcade game to play on my laptop and GRID isn't it. But neither it's realistic. So: it's not fun and not realistic...you get the worst of both worlds."
"To put it as simply as possible, not worth anyone's tome &amp; money. Even for an arcade game, it sucks."
"If you like any other racing games, I don't reccomend this one. Unless you like driving on ice through a blizzard with bald tires."
"Disclaimer: My references to Need For Speed and GranTurismo are purely for comparison. I will admit to having a bias for them as I have played them far longer than Grid. My references to the Formula One and 24 Hours of Le Mans series are also comparative in nature,  Oh man. Where to even begin with this.  Pros: -Difficulty, for some -Range of cars and game modes  Cons: -DIFFICULTY Now people may call me a wimp or otherwise on this but the most realistic racing experience I've had is GranTurismo for Sony's PSP (2009) that features: realistic cars, an optional driving line that changes color on speed (this is quite useful for beginners and veterans alike, as beginners can get used to the track and veterans get reminded of the perfect line), the option to tune cars, a choice between normal and realistic physics, a reasonably large minimap, varied tracks, varying degrees of difficulty in race modes and a TIME TRIAL MODE. SO THAT I CAN GET USED TO THE DRIVING AND THE PHYSICS. Grid won't even let me have a chance to get used to the driving and physics because I get thrown straight into a race with godly AI even at 'Basic' difficulty. Someone else noticed that in the LM races the turning point for the car isn't at the front wheels but in the middle. I noticed this as well when I couldn't get around the corner onto Mulsanne as fast as LITERALLY all of the other cars, even the ones in a slower LMGT class. I've raced La Sarthe before on GranTurismo and it was quantifiably easier to control LMP cars and all other cars. I'm currently used to Need for Speed Underground 2 and Undercover physics that offer at the very least near-instant response on steering. The steering and brake lag coupled with the crazy burnout on every acceleration out of corners has persuaded me that this is the most frustrating racing game I have ever played. In NFSU2 and GT I could at least tune the cars to personally change aspects of the ride that I liked and disliked (suspension, camber angles, ride height, aerodynamics, etc.). In Grid there is literally NOTHING I can do to gain an advantage without dying 200 times or restarting every race 1000 times. And to me, that ain't fun at all. -Difficult course in the BEGINNING of the campaign??? -No tutorial???? -NO TIME TRIAL MODE???????????? -No tuning????????? See people who expect realistic racing expect tuning capabilities to..um you know...FIX THE UNDERSTEER ON ALL LM AND OPEN WHEEL CARS AND BURNOUTS ON ALL OF THE CARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Bottom line, I personally loathe this game for a bunch of terrible decisions made by an ignorant dev team who obviously have no clue what 'racing games' can and have offered to the table for maximum enjoyment for everyone.     On a sidenote, I'm currenty watching the 2015 24 Hours of Le Mans (last 9 hours on Porsche 919 #19 [winning car]) on Youtube and how the guys are handling the corners, and it is IMPOSSIBLE to do their moves on the garbage physics and against the godly AI of Grid. I mean I find it easier to clock fast lap times on my Toyota GT-ONE from GranTurismo facing the hardest AI on La Sarthe for several hours in a row than even finishing one lap on La Sarthe without getting totalled. HELL, RACING THE F2007 ON MONACO IN GT WAS MORE FUN THAN THIS RUBBISH GAME."
game won't even start. I've looked online a good number of people are having this problem. No one has found a solution and none has been offered by the devs. Waste of money.
Call this good driving ai? Let yourself sit in last for a bit and watch 5 of them wipe out without getting touched. Rubbish.

has lag spikes and the grqaphics suck
anytime i try to play it and it DOESNT WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I think this game isn't good cause everytime the grip of the differents car is the same 'unstable', all car i have taken it was just a total delusion. I think you need to try if you not believe me, but i advice this game isn't good enough. So for this reason i can't consider this idea 'semi manageral of not arcade game'. So save your money and buy other car racing game better"
"Bought it because of the discound that was on this game, beware, if you're a fan of the NEED FOR SPEED FRANCHISE this is SO NOT the game you're looking for, this is a real 'on track' driving simulation, graphics are ok but the car takes damage during races and doesn't respond anymore if you're not careful and smash a lot. But enough with the bad stuff, this game has a good variety of cars and tracks and different types of gameplay so for people who like that kind of games... it's definitely a good game. But again, since it's not my kind of game, and since I didn't like it, I don't recommend it."
has lag spikes and the grqaphics suck
Love this game but i cant seem to fix the stuttering issue its really starting to irritate me i have no idea on how to fix it and I cant race when it happens would recomend this game more if the stuttering and FPS drop was fixed
Does not have Online
FU Codefukkers for killing the multiplayer of the best arcade-racer back in 2011!

"Some may say this game is good, I would say its good too, but I don't simply like it. I don't know why, I just don't like any of the grid games, I prefer Dirt 3, and only Dirt 3.  I do think this game has nice graphics, physics and much more, but I simply don't like it :C, sorry."
"Whilst Grid is a fun game and really good buy at $10, it is completed ruined by the fact that a very large number of people including myslef, have real problems in opening the game, there are many 'fixes' but none seem to work. Be careful when purchasing this game, you might not be able to play it."
"EDIT: The game is not as bad as I originally thought, but it is a bit too difficult for my likes. It works well now, so I guess I got better? I don't know. The game is alright, and for £1.99 you might get a good time out of it. The graphics are kind of ugly now, but if you have a potato it will probably work like a charm. The racing is kinda fun, the cars are kinda nice, and overall it is kinda good.  At this point I can't give it a rating but it is fun, just really really hard, hence the negative review."
"A couple of things about this (and Codemaster racing games). The max resolution isn't very high since it's an older title. 1280x**** is about it. The upside is if you have older equipment it'll play just fine with this game. The downside is if you have newer equipment, it won't take advantage of it at all. The graphics are still quite good though. The actual racing game play is great, the animations are smooth, and the handling of the car is really good too.  Why don't I recommend this game though? It has to do with the verbal diarrhea that codemasters apparently likes to put into their racing games.  If I'm playing a racing game it's because I WANT TO RACE, not be preached to by the game about stuff I could care less about. What makes it worse is the game forces you to listen to all of it and you can't skip it no matter how hard you try. Want to quit the game? Tough! You've gotta sit through EVERYTHING, watch all the animations, and listen to all the dialog too. I have Dirt 3 and it suffers from the same dumb problem. While I'm happy that Codemasters is very proud of all the artwork and dialog that they put into the game, but when you're forced to be a captive audience, it gets under your skin VERY fast. How annoying is all of this? Well... when the game wouldn't let me back out of it gracefully and was insistent that I listen to some dope talk to me, I hit the reset button my computer to get out of the game.  At least with Dirt 3 I got it for free from a video card purchase. With Grid thankfully I got it on a steam sale and it was really cheap, but with the annoyance factor this game and Dirt 3 present I'm most likely just going to erase this thing from my hard drive and try to forget that I ever played it. I'm serious, it's THAT annoying!"
"This doesn't seem to even allow you to choose a resolution over 1280x1024. Numerous cut scenes are a drag too. I just want to race, not be forced to endure the transitions your art team designed."
"Controls are ♥♥♥♥ unless you have PC controller, and the rewind thing doesn't work at all."
"This game is not what you would expect for a racing game, while it says that there is drifting in the game, that is all it is, Drifting, you can't race and just race you have to drift through the race and that is all you can do. You can't enjoy the racing due to that. One little turn and bam you loose, because you have spun off the road,and by the time you can get back on the road the other cars are gone, and the npc's are over powerd as they are programed to be on the track they can not go off the track, they can have damage, but they will never spin off at all. It seemes also that the npc's can not be bumped off the track as well... but they can and do bump you off. So if you want a racing game and see this game when it is on sale, don't wast your money, now however if you want a drifting game this is the one for you.  But all and all this game is compleat and utter crap, you can't turn worth a d*** and it is impossible to play because of that. Above i did say to those who want a drifting game would like this but not even them the drifting does not even work either. So think of this game like a cancer and avoid it."
"Game starts with the last used profile active, which is fine if you are on an inherently single user machine but not if you now have to steer a few computer illiterate children through the menu's each time so as to give them each a separate profile; kind of mandatory in a game where stages unlock based on progress.  Other than that I found the game to be largely uncontrollable with either keyboard or Xbox 360 controller; the car constantly drifted to one side. Adding insult to injury, at least on Windows 7 and when running Steam under an unprivileged user account, a UAC prompt pops up on each and every start of the game (for which just hitting escape works, but still.)  Took the opportunity to try out Steam's refund policy, which  does  work well. If you don't mind or even prefer even more arcade styling, grab 'DiRT Showdown' instead. It's currently the almost same price and none of the above applies to it. It is moreover a heck of a lot of fun."
"This game is... mediocre. At least on gameplay standpoint. I understand this game aimed for somewhere between arcade and simulation, I personally wanted scream and say 'make up your mind!'  The AI in this game is incredibly aggressive, they will smash into you no matter where you are. It is so ridiculous, even on Touge duel when opponent was behind he kept hitting me causing him to have 3 penalties of 6 seconds. I adjusted the difficulties, and yes eventually AI stopped hitting me but that's only because their top speed is much lower. On many of the standard race where you compete against 11 CPU, good luck. When one guy spins out, usually that leads to mass traffic jam. Key to victory: get top 3 in 1 lap. That was only strategy I could find.  Honestly I was very excited for this game, but I am quite dissapointed. If I wanted to play bumper car then I will get a bumper car game. Don't tell me this is a simulation racing game just because of the physic. Actually, physic is pretty terrible too, unless you turn on assist- your car will spin around like crazy; especially on grass. Again though, since CPU will bang into you so many times you really don't need assist to help youself to spinout. There isn't even a time trial available to practice!! You have to progress into game to unlock time trial (or test drive) appearently.   They tried, I can tell. But they literally made too many bad decisions all over it's just a mess. Imagine this- you've been told to play gran turismo, but AI plays like burnout. This is it.  Do yourselves a favor and buy Simbin product. I had way more fun than this in about the same price. You could get Need for Speed if you are into arcade style. Just not this.  4/10"
"worst racing game ever!! Cars just slide through every turn into a wall or the grass/dirt as racers, going the same speed, in the same car, flash passed you. I couldn,t find a way to keep up with even the slowest cars. good thing I only paid a couple of bucks for it"
I really wanted to like this game because I owned Grid 2 before I bought this one on sale and I like Grid 2 but Grid as far as controls goes is beyond anything I can bother with trying to learn. I have never played a racking game where it is so easy to just sit there and spin your tires.
"Do not recommend. Spent countless hours on this on console, PC port is rubbish. No 1080p support, options menu is poorly worked (press up on a vertical scrollable menu for advanced options, whut?)   But, get it if you have a steering wheel and a 720p screen. Game is great in general, port is garbage."
One of the worst racing games I ever played. You have absolutely no control over the car. No matter if you carefully use the pedals or not the car just thinks in binary. so it fully accelerates and you loose control over it. Even worse is the handling in the turns. even the high performance cars in this game are uncontrollable because the game thinks drifting is the only thing.  absolutely a no go this game.
This game is insanely hard and unforgiving towards new players.  It's almost impossible to control using a steering wheel (at least mine).  No damage disable. No custom race. No free run.
i want back my money this game very sh+t......
"Poorly optimised for PC.  This game would be good for a console but I feel that it doesn't have all the necisities of a PC game. There are no graphics options, which would make it difficult for people with lower quality systems to play without a bit of screen tearing. The controls are unchangeable and you use the arrow keys for pretty much everything. No mouse is used."

"Grid is a game that caters to no one. It doesn't take me long to realize that this game is nothing more than a really bad racing sim. Now i've played Gran Turismo 2 on the PS1, back then we didn't have games like I racing and Gran Turismo was one of the closest types of games we got to simulation. Now I can safely say that Gran Turismo 2 is a vastly superior game to Grid for a multitude of reasons.  For starters there's the career, you get to choose from numorous cars in Gran Turismo 2 and tune them up as you see fit. You can race in many disciplines from tracks, endurance and even rally. The graphics may be the only saving grace of Grid, whilst they do look really nice for a 2007 game I feel that it does little to make the game any more fun to play. In it's execution, Grid feels pitifully archaic as if it's not even trying. When it does little more than be a bare bones racing sim, it tries little to include any of the features of an arcade racer. Ok, sure. It has some car customization but it's depth is so bare minimum that you get very few options.  In addition, it's impossible to tune each individual car as you see fit. This only serves to make the game feel worse as there's no individuality. The game also requires you to buy cars to progress with the career but it falters for the simple fact that you can only race them in specific events. As such, personalization is pitiful and pointless, not only does every car feel the same as another player's car but the so-called 'branding' feels lazy for a 2007 game.  Now a lot of people will argue that Grid is one of those games that pulls you in with it's immersion. It does try by making it possible to lose events... just like in real life. However that charm disappears when you start your own racing team and are given a set of races and if you lose, you will either retire and come back to it later or retry. This kills the immersion quickly.  In addition, for a game that prides itself on being so 'arcade' and has touge racing with traffic on the roads, why isn't there any open world driving? This is 2007 people. Need For Speed Underground 2 had it, why doesn't this? Now you could argue 'it's a sim, it's not supposed to be about street racing' and you'd be wrong because i swear I saw traffic cars in the middle of a touge race. How am I supposed to hold on to my suspension of disbelief when there's a huge crowd in a seemingly organized race with traffic all over the road, is this even legal? Why are there traffic on a road where an official race is taking place? Why are sponsers even supporting such illigam activity? Sure they did this in NFSU2 but that game is an arcade racer, not a sim. Grid is trying so hard to be a sim... but failing on every single level.  But don't you dare try to convince me that this is in any way an arcade racer because if it is an arcade racer, it is the third worst racing game i've ever played. This game is anything but arcade. There are zero arcade mechanics and the few arcade options include lazy customization and... well thats about it. The rest is pretty much everything bad that comes out of an arcade racer... and a simulation racer.  That's right, this game tries to be an arcade racer and a simulation racer but in truth it takes all the bad from both genres and just throws it in there. Traffic on the roads, irritating handling, lack of personalization and tuning, ridiculously abyssmal physics and completely unrealistic structure of racing.  My advice is if you want to play an arcade racer, try Need For Speed (pre-Pro Street), Midnight Club 3 and Forza Horizon (which has some sim elements in it as well). If you want a simulation, play I racing. If you want light simulation, play Project cars, leave this game in the dust as it will only frustrate you no matter what demographic you are. You'll either be insulted as a simulation fan or frustrated as an arcade fan.   Avoid"
"First of all, game wont start if you first won't search for and put the right files in the windows and game folders. Second theres no ingame sound. Windows 7. Never had these problems before. This game should be deleted from lists. Gaben truly is disonbru Murichan scum! Ticket progress awaits...  DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!"
♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAME. YOU HAVE THE SKILL BUT ALL THE COMS WILL GO AND CRUSH U LIKE HELL. THIS GAME IS NOT RECOMMANDED BUYING. U R WASTING YOUR MONEY 
"Probably a good game for someone, but wtf it doesn't support controller? WTF is that? Seriously. Gosh."
It's garbage.
Bag of plop. Terrible physics and ai. Remember playing this on console when it came out and remember enjoying it. Not any more. Plenty of much better driving games out there that at least add some realism/fun to them.
It was good before they shuting down the multiplayer and for now its not worth to buy
Do not buy. Multiplayer is dead. RIP
"Terrible console port. Unrealistic, convoluted, boring."
I do not know how to go multiplayer
"For some reason the steering was way too sensitive. I played around with the setting which helped a bit but not enough, when i quickly tap left the car curves way too much to the left which causes me to almost crash but even if I manage to steer right I crash to the right side.  This made me unable to play the game and I don't even know why it's so sensitive, I don't think it's meant to be."
"The game looked nice, it had an enourmous discount and i desided to try it out.  Well, so far, so bad. The game launches, shows the trailer and than the start menu is compleatly gone. All there is is a black screen. The menu still functions, but what's the point in that when you can see ♥♥♥♥? I even tryed spamming enter and i went in a race somehow. All i can see is the gps, my pos, speedometer, etc, but nothing from the game itself. I'd love the devs to do something about that, because at it's state, the game is compleately unplayable for me. I have no idea how Steam still supports the game, but I gues I will never know.  Anyway, I'd advice you not to buy the game, because there's a REALLY high chance of it not working."

♥♥♥♥ing very hard control
"Putrid, filty, disquisting, ugly, ♥♥♥♥ty physics. Stay away!"
C'mon they can do better than this
"This game nails the driving mechanic better than like 5 other racing games I've tried in recent years, including 2 NFS games, Grid 2, Dirt 2.   So if for some reason you feel like a driving game this one is good. But it's also starting to get old, and you just drive and race.. it's just driving really. May as well get in the car and drive. wee "
i want my money back. this game hasnt worked on any current pc you have to go through supid steps just to make the game ♥♥♥♥ing playable. I do not recomend getting this game. i have tried all steps to try to make the game work with no luck. im not computer illiterate i follow steps that people have posted and i cant even find the information stated.
"This review is base off HARD difficulty and playing with a G27 wheel.  I read a bunch of review about how GRID is the best out of the series, if this is the best, the series SUCK! First off I'm in my mid 30's and driven on race tracks multiple times and this game doesn't even come close to how it really feels. I understand this game is not a sim, instead a more arcade kinda game.   Couple of problem with the game is none of the cars have any weight to them, they all feel like paper cars. I played Iracing and other racing games with my G27 wheel this game has the worst wheel feel.   They try to make this game hard by doing all the wrong things. Perfect example is Team Raven Crest, instead of making them a challenge because of their driving skills, they instead just give them the fastest car and boosting them a littler more so their car is uncatchable in the category race you're in.  Another thing they do wrong is how cars react when they come in contact with each other during the race. I don't understand why every time you get hit or you hitting someone from any angel you're the one that is spinning out and the AI just drives off fine.   Overall if you never driven a real car before and under the age of 16 you'll think this game is awesome. For anyone looking for a fair challenge or a driving game that is more close to real life feel this isn't it. If you check all my review I'm normally pretty good on recommending games and never really vote no on recommendation, but this game is a total joke.   Save your money for Project C.A.R.S or Assetto Corsa."
"Simply the worst driving 'game' I've had the misfortune to purchase. Every race, the slightest of dings will spin you into a wall, turn you 360 degrees, and dump you into last place - the very same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that used to plague the NFS series until they sorted the physics engine. Do not play, unless you desire nothing but frustration."
start race-spinout-start race-spinout-start race-spinout-start race-spinout   PRETTY MUCH THIS GAME IN A NUTSHELL  GG GR8 GRASS M8 I R8 THIS 8/88888888888888
The controls don't work and can't find any fixes for the problem. So I'll have to give this game a bad review since I can't even play it.
its kind of like an overpriced arcade game.
"Doesn't work, too much hassle to fix. Going to try to get money back for faulty goods from steam , that's a f***ing laugh :("
"The multiplayer doesn't work. I paid for an incomplete game, and for this reason I asked for a refund."
"this game is the worst car driving experience, not valuable, hard to controll and hard to win all of the game. I really dont recommend this game for you all. I think NFS underground 1 is better than this game."
One of the worst racing games I have ever played. Other racers hit you at every corner and spin you out and theres not a damn thing you can do about it. So bad. Do yourself a favour and avoid this game LIKE THE PLAUGUE.
"While Grid was once presumably a premier racing game, it's now 9 years old and has aged badly.  No widescreen support, no support for HD monitors and above are simply too damaging for this game to be playable today.  These are things that would be quite fixable if the developer, who are still selling this product and accepting money for it, dedicated the effort to fix with a modernisation patch.   Reprehensible developer behavior and lack of support for modern systems makes this game unrecommendable."
"Cons:  Playing this with a logitech g27, the car is absolutely atrocious to handle.  Has a weird yellow ish tint on everything.  AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Physics make you spin around even when a feather touches your car, AI doesn't seem to have that issue.   Pro's:  Cars look nice, scenery is ok.  Would not recommend."
"I enjoyed playing this game when it first released back on the PS3, however the lack of control settings is irritating and makes the game more unessesarily difficult overall. I cannot switch the standard arrow keys to the WSAD keys for acceleration and other driving options, and it makes the gameplay more tedious and unenjoyable. The controlling isn't available through mouse either, making it nearly impossible to be precise with your steering and other manevuers. If this issue were to be fixed, I would recommend it, but until this is no longer an issue, I can't agree to it."
"Great mix between simulation and arcade, amazing cockpit with solid graphic but AI is annoying and stupid"
"I'm using the logitech g27 for this game and the steering is complete ♥♥♥♥, its either straight or completely to the left/right... i mind as well be using a keyboard. also, the resolution doesnt go past 1280x720 :( refunded."
This game and the second is probably the worst game ive ever played its wont even let you turn its is such a sucky game the only fun i had with it was uninstalling it and writing this dissing review
"This is the car races game I've enjoyed the most (on xbox360). Bought it on Steam. No multiplayer support. Never played it again. Single player is ok, but only buy this game if it costs you nothing!"
"I must say that you need a simplified game with good graphics. Grid basic is NOT one of them. Oh, and let's not leave out good sound effects. Nothing worst than intro material. What is it for anyway? It should be DIFFERENT every time BTW."
"I wanted to give this game a thumbs up, I really did. When GRID is going right it is one of the very bast racing games I have ever played, however it does not go right often. The physics engine is top notch, but the game is just too unforgiving. Especially with a controller. There are some turns that are simply too tight, and require too much precision for a joystick to be able to handle. Also, i find that my personal actions have very little to do with the outcome. AI cars will take the strangest lines and suddenly veer off in front of you or take you out from the side, and dear god if you even think about touching another racer or a curb (especially in open wheel) you are toast. And there is nothing you can do about it. I think GRID game within 10% of being a truly great game, one for the ages but its unforgiving nature and finiky controls let it down. However, that being said I am not going to stop playing. It may take three days and a hundred restarts, but when it goes right GRID is a blast. (Oh, and way, way, way better than GRID 2. Ugh.)"
"First of all, this is not a bad game but definitely not for me. I would rate it 5/10  For the pro part, it is as great as everyone else has mentioned so I'll just skip it and go ahead to my rant.  Cons - Easily lose control of your vehicle (especially if you do the accelerate + turning) - Drifting is a joke - Could get stuck at certain angle (and there is no reset car position) - Hitting the side a little could easily resulting on your car flying and crashing - Crashes way too easily  All in all, its a pretty good game but definitely not for everyone. and for beginners, remember, drive slow and steady, no rush."
"I play a lot of racing games, and I love them. I didn't love this one: I found the cars too slidey and never felt in control; the AI will just crash into you for no reason and make you crash; the off track lack of grip is badly simulated. However, if thats what your into then by all means pick it up."
"Have to say its been pritty terrable when I tried playing it, bad controls, didn't seem to have much freedom, kinda stuck with one car for one race, dosn't seem u have the ability to keep to a car you like or anything like that."
The years have not been kind at all. The menus look very dated and shout of a console past. Driving is a bit meh if using a gamepad and gameplay is also dull. You will need to hack ini to get above 1280*768 as it will not recognise &gt; 512Mb on modern gfx cards.  Only played as working through my backlog of games I got cheap. 2 hours and this one is done.
"This game is pretty good in reflecting how driving a racing car feels like but lacks the same brilliance in many other areas.  1- Circuits: Not much variety and you'll find yourself doing the exact same thing in every circuit. Same brakes, same speeding same cornering etc. 2- Atmosphere: Soundtrack of this game is pretty limited and the selected music makes me feel like playing a very low budget FPS. 3- AI and some crash physics: While you're following the optimum line for turns you'll find yourself crashed into barriers on insane speeds even the AI racer only hit you slightly. This made the game unplayable especially during global racing for me as higher the speeds, higher damage your car will get from crashing. Also your teammates will see you as a rival driver, as they will occasionally try to corner by crashing into your car. This especially happens when you have a very good teammate. 4- No multiplayer. 5- Drifting: Even though I suck at drifting in any racing game, drifting was especially easy for me in GRID, as all I had to do was to drift a little bit near the flags to get insane scores.  Racing at low levels is good, when you get much more faster it's nerve-breaking. I wanted to give it a try upon seeing it got so many positive reviews on Steam and some other sources on the internet, I liked the game until it became impossible to turn before getting hit.  6/10"
"While I would like to recommend this game since I enjoyed it thoroughly when it got released in 2007, there are quite the few issues with this game; Difficulty, even at Extreme I hardly noticed any challenge in getting to first place when it got to terms of speed and laptimes. Placing you at the end of the grid doesnt constitute difficulty in any way. The greatest difficulty isn't overtaking or maintainin speed, it is to avoid the AI in any collisions and corners. Which brings me to the most painfull parts of this game; blatant rubberbanding and AI pushing you off the tracks or blocking you from making a corner. Either by randomly hitting the brakes in a corner that can be taken on full throttle or just by tapping your rear end so you can't make the corner.  Sadly, I'd still love to give this game a thumbs up but...it's just way more frustrating to play then I can remember. "
Not a great game. Steering is unrealistic.
I bought this game on sale and I am super disappointed. They removed the Multiplayer servers. You guys are better off torrenting this game. :C
"The controls are very difficult to control, and when I attempted to convert it to WASD it said it was invalid."
NFS Pro Street and Shift better.
"The game is almost perfect, but is destroyed by the controls, but how cars react, and the imposible sistem of lose control, in almost every corner even on easy."
The AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rivals the new Nascar games but not as bad. Every car except the open wheel cars do nothing but drift around corners so if you looking to have a game where you race a line dont pick this cause your not going to do that unless you slow to a snails speed Overall thias game is as disappointing as Grid 2 people saying this game is better than Grid 2 is stupid there both equally ♥♥♥♥  This just be me saying this cause Im a sim race but I still enjoy arcade racers this is not a good one though -10/10 IGN
"Yes and no.   No - it is not a racing simulator as advertised   Yes - if you are looking for a crazy non physics base racing game, (meaning is the programming doesn’t allow it, it won't happen.   PS. do not dare touch the AI cars.... well trains, you will spin 180 on a dime and they will continue as if hit by a feather.  "
"The game is almost perfect, but is destroyed by the controls, but how cars react, and the imposible sistem of lose control, in almost every corner even on easy."
Hate on me but nothing will be better than Need For Speed Most Wanted for the PS2. This game is boring.
"Generic racing game. It's good for the price tag and release date, but I'd recommend the newer GRID games if you really want to have a GRID experience. 7.5/10"
"GRID is fun for a while but really gets old. GRID has nothing on NFS Shift (1). In GRID the AI *really* sucks because they will drive you off of the track if you get caught up. Instead of backing off the AI does not realize it is tangled with another driver and trys to stay on the racing line which will cause your car to understeer into a wall. This wouldn't be so bad if the starting grid positioning system didnt *really* suck. You basically claw your way through the pack from last place in every race. Lots of traffic jams and dumb AI and it gets old after a while. Another thing that bothers me is no staggered start for multi-class races. NFS Shift has better AI, better physics, vehicle tuning, funner career, cooler cars, and better tracks. Get that instead. XD"
I dont like the game honestly ....
Not available in 1080. Gameplay got stagnant. Was a lot more fun on ps3 when it came out.
"Pros: Challenging, Graphics (great for an old game, better than many modern ones) Cons: Zero customization, Boring as hell.  Verdict: Don't bother."
"it is hard to control the car, DONT GET THIS RUBBISH GAME"
It made me want to punch a baby...
#boring
"Every car I've driven feels like its made of paper and the cars drift relentlessly like I'm constantly on ice. Don't even get me started on those awful drifting challenges. The AI is also a mess - they can t-bone you at over 100 mph and send you spinning, meanwhile they drive off like nothing happened. If you pull a stunt like that it will grind you to a halt and probably cost you a race. Speaking of that, a few different times in those 1v1 no-contact pro races I was hit from behind by the AI and I was the one to get penalized. Yeah what the ♥♥♥♥.. aargh this game, oh and 'simulation' is a very loose term considering its more like some rubbish money grab from an arcade machine."
"The game core/essence does nearly everything right. That means driving.  However:   1. No lap times/best times at the end of races? What the... it's a ♥♥♥♥♥ race game. Would've been a huge motivation factor.  2. The highest difficulty is too easy. Having to start from behind doesn't mean the game is challenging. It's just bugging and compensating the average AI. The AI is too passive. They go out of your way and brake if you get close to them or they get close to you. You can literally drive at 10-20 kmh on those 1on1 tracks and stay easily in front of the opponent and win the race. There is no pathfinding ability in case of a block. For an above average player that's way too easy to exploit.  3. The sponsoring notifications. Oh lord... Of course it's not that long the first time it comes up but after every race - it destroys any momentum/flow the game picked up.  4. The game &amp; its events feel random.   5,5/10 - Still slightly on the fun side but not worth it compared to other racing games."
"Won't open. Installs, but never runs."
"If you like AI cars bashing into you at 200 mph sending you spinning off-road, whilst they just carry on as normal, then buy this game  If you want to have an actual fun racing experience, then don't bother."
I personally don't like the controls. Racing on here is really hard.
need my $$$$$$ back
  -crashes each time I try open graphics settings
Does not work on Windows 7 x64. After lots of stuffing around trying to follow instructions to make it work I still couldn't get it. The system requirements do say Windows XP/Vista but you really think they would make it compatible with a modern OS.
"This game is a absolute joke. I got it on sale and from what little research I did this was the best game of the GRID series. IF THIS IS THE BEST GAME OF THE SERIES THEN THIS SERIES SUCKS! I know its not a hardcore sim, but even after just a few minutes of playing all the cars feel like their made of paper, if you are looking for a somewhat realistic experience then this is not it (go buy Assetto Corsa or Rfactor 2) The cars in this game handle like they're on rails, There is absoultly no reason to even use brakes in this game.  Pros: It was on sale, Lots of cars/tracks Cons: Everything else.... Horrible physics, too much 'Bro Dude' feel (If I bought a racing game then I would assume I want to race), ABSOLUTLY no detail inside cars, Some glitchy camera bug that makes the camera twitch uncontrollably every 5 minutes.... Need I go on?   TL:DR- Its terrible. If you want a realistic experience go buy Assetto Corsa or Rfactor 2."
"Although the game may look nice, and sound nice, the steering is just absolutely awful when it comes to using a keyboard. I tried using a controller, and it worked fine for the menu selections and whatnot, but it wouldn't work when it came to actually driving. I don't care for the physics of the game (whether the game is supposed to be realistic or not). I don't care if it's a simulator or not. I was looking for a racing game and that's what I expect. A racing game. A game where the controls won't matter using a keyboard, controller or steering wheel. I got easily frustrated with the game and found it to be a huge waste of space on my computer. I, personally, wouldn't recommend it based on my experience. However, if you're into racing games, and have no troubles with the controls (however you're playing the game), then this game may be for you. You'll have to play the game to see what you truely think of it."
"This game sucks donkey. Don't buy it. The controls are unrealistic, ♥♥♥♥ poor and overall this game sucks."
Multiplayer is down.
"Arcade style racing game. Overall the game handles like the need for speed series a bit. Drifting mode is fun, but the game seemed to lack enough substance to bring continued excitement."
the worst handling in any driving game ive ever played
"Fun game... until you start having thoughts about why you start LAST every single ****ing time, then by the time you make it to 1st place with only 2 laps left.... your vehicle is a total wreck with zero steering capability and your radiator leaking. This is on NORMAL, I can't even imagine what's it like in hard/pro difficulty"
"I don't even know where to begin. As ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ racing games go this is one of the worst. Sure, if you don't mind crashing into stuff that's not there or if you dont mind having your car reset sideways on the track in front of the rest of the race pack you'll enjoy this. As far as I'm concerned it's crap even by old game standards."
"Really sad and bad racing game. First of all, if you have played Flatout 2 or FO Ultimate Carnage, this feels like some very old playstation1 game (when you crash = its like a rubber car *boink* and nothing happens) .. Also the online function wasn't/isn't even available when I bought it.. I really don't recommend this crap. Warning if you are considering playing this with friends over Internet: Their servers are permanently OFFLINE, only LAN works, but the game isn't even fun so why bother?"
"This game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks ♥♥♥♥, I have no idea why it's got such great reviews."
"Played it for a few minutes, the driving felt bad, stopped playing. I have too many games in my library to be playing games that I don't enjoy. Maybe I will return to it one day."
"I used to love playing GRID with my keyboard, the drifting and racing was cool, with plenty of different cars and race types to enjoy. But then I tried it with a gamepad, and racing wheel... I noticed that there's a permanent driving assist that helps keep you on the racing line, making it very hard to make mistakes. With a pad or wheel this is frustrating because the road is inconsistent, you get used to a certain amount of steering, but as soon as you deviate from the racing line everything changes. You unintentionally throw your car wildly off the line you want because of it, which is hard when you move to overtake for a corner. It doesn't matter what car or track you're on then, the permanent assists make this as arcade as you can get. Don't mistake this for a simulator, everything about it is fake, even AI crashes are scripted. If you're behind then they slow down, if you're ahead then they speed up by a big margin. My profile can't save anymore, so I can't even progress my game stats. GRID is still some fun, but head to Race07 if you want a racing simulator on Steam."
"fun for a while. it has some ultra annoying things: you cant skip instructional videos and talks you cant care less about. just sit and listen a minute to this, becouse you probably dont know, that you should be first in racing. physics. did I just bumped into rear of drifting car before me? I should spin uncontrollably not him. did I just scrape this wall a tiny bit? yeah, it should turn you head on to the wall. did you just drifted into the wall? how about going into the air!  last thing, may be my problem, but some strange incostitency in dificulty. I can win this race, and this race, I'm ok in another, but in next I'm dead last and don't have any idea why and what I'm doing wrong."
"Perhaps I had different expectations than I should've coming into this, but after playing the F1 games from Codemasters I expected a lot more.  I've tried this out with my Logitech Driving Force GT and after a bit of confusion and Googling, I discovered that, even though the game 'supports' the wheel, I had to manually assign controls myself. This was annoying, but I figured fair enough. It gets worse when I went into the game proper. From what I can see from my own testing and Google searching there is no force feedback in this game. The wheel is constantly loose, and it gets worse. The driving model is very game-y. I came into this thinking it would be, or at least offer the option of a sim experiance, especially since it's tagged on Steam as such. Instead, after turning all driving aids off, I found that I could soar around the track with total ease and little regard for my vehicle.  If you're after a 'game', then this will probably do you fine. I could imagine it would be decent with a gamepad (I haven't tried this yet, though I'm not sure I can be bothered). If, however, you're after a sim, I'd suggest you get yourself a copy of Assetto Corsa instead.  EDIT: I should also mention that it's not the prettiest game. The sounds are pretty bad too, unless you really love superchargers. Seriously, just get Assetto Corsa instead."
I could play for about 1 hour and the controls just stop working the gameplay and graphics are good but you can't play the game waste of money
"If you were looking for an arcade-y like racer, this is not it. Real world sim to the damn letter. Did you slide off the road and unto the grass going 50+? Prepare (note: you can't) to go into spin mode for like 10 seconds. If your wheels touch anywhere that isn't the pavement then you're screwed. The damn difficulty too, if you're not a seasoned racing game player, then even the basic difficulty will give you trouble. Another game I wish I could get my money back for."
"Ever been forced to ride a rollercoaster, then forced to enjoy it, and forced to not be naturally sick at your stomache but to smile? Yeah...thats kinda how playing GRID felt to my disappointment. Few games for me compare to the feel of 'rail racer' like this one does...except maybe some kind of Pokemon Snap on crystal meth. I feel like I'm just along for the ride and am not the least bit important in this whole racing process. The being sick thing isn't meant to be an insult toward the game, in all tunnel-vision, arcadey respects, its a great arcade racing game I suppose. I'm more of a simulation racing fan I guess... although I really enjoyed arcade racers like InitialD, that game had a distinct feature that for me, set it far and away in immersion from GRID. That feature would be Buying Parts. To me, there are two things that make a racing game feel like an extension of you, your personal choice of cars, and your personal customization in parts and part settings to those cars. GRID starts out on the wrong foot (for the first 3 hours or so) by giving you no permanent choice in the matter by momentarilly mentioning you're a driver and will work for other teams initially. Ok fine... so I finished what amounts to a 3 hour tutorial where I'm driving other peoples cars with seemingly no direction except for which of three global regions the races are in, and then I start to wade through very limited (and seemingly irrelevant) decisions in between races. *sigh* After about 6 hours. I couldn't care less how much money I'd made, it's only used to buy one particular car for each particular race you enter. Or a selection between two or three cars for each race. Either way, I couldn't have cared less how much money I'd made, how many of this obscure region points I'd earned, or which team this annoying announced kept telling me was somehow more important than the next mindless drone in my way to the finish line... How this game has such a high meta score is ALMOST beyond me. But I do understand its arcade-y appeal. It must not be for me. After dialing in what I think will be the perfect settings for a specific car for a specific class of race, on a specific track, under specific conditions, and making fine adjustments after practice laps of that track...that to me is the process of racing. Not 'Heres a car or two, we've already set everything up...just get in it. Its like a roller coaster! Say wheee! And put your arms up...SMILE! PUT YOUR ARMS IN THE AIR AND SMILE! NOW!!!' lol Thats kinda what it feels like.."
"I only got this game because I asked like many others I've read, 'What game for PC is like Forza' and lemme tell ya, this game is nothing like Forza. I've been playing racing games since 16 bit NES and this is one the worst handling games I've ever played. It's just way too tight and there's no way to loosen it. These cars handle like a Hover Round or a riding lawn mower micro car. You drift through all turns, there's very little physics and G force like in a real car. I like muscle cars and very loose steering where I can slide into a turn. I just ran the 1st few tracks maybe it gets better but the only time this car seems to wanna steer straight is into a wall.  I did notice that, when you're headed towards a wall man this thing stays on a line like a champ, if it handled that way in the straights this game would rock I think. But it seems like the walls are giant magnets pulling you into them. And if you try to steer headed towards one, that great tight steering just disappears. Once your car is damaged, you're screwed, restart the race cuz there's no repairs or anyways to fix anything.  I found one way to trick the game when you go into turns is to floor it and 360 your way through the turn but watch the overcompensation on the way out. Like I said, it actually appears to be coded to put you into the wall, so you can kinda fool it this way by just donuting your way thru the turns. It's forcing you to drift.  This game has much potential, I hear a wheel makes it better but I kinda doubt it if you like old school racing games with a controller. This really is pretty much drifting which I guess is ok but it gets boring pretty fast to me, I prefer living on the edge of G force and that wall, that's actually in Forza. I'll screw around with this game some more probably but if you read get this game if you like Forza...ummm dont, its nothing like Forza at all except there's tracks, cars glitter, sun and crowds."
"Ever wondered what it would be like to be the worlds worst raceing driver? Then this is the game for you.  Before the game is fully loaded you are put in a 650bhp car on a track with no idea how to drive. You are left mashing the keyboard tying to find the throttle control while the other cars leave you in their dust. Meanwhile your pit-chief (played by the single most annoying voice actor in the world) is patronising you. 'Well done, You can finish this race!'  After about 20mins you get the option to set your controls and preferences. Not that is helps much as most preferences seem to be track specific and need to be changed very single race.  The lack of practice laps and qualifying means you are dropped in the deep end in every race. The challenge of the game is in learning the tracks rather than going fast as the AI for the most part is quite slow. That is until you get a team mate. Your team mate is only ever good at one style of racing, but in that style they become your biggest rival, often costing you the race.  It's a damn shame. This game has a really nice driving engine and the sponsorship deals are a great idea, but they don't make up for all the flaws that the developers seem to think are features. I hope I never have to listen to that pit chief again for the rest of my life."
"Apparently, it's quite late to put some reviews seeing that this game is pretty old. Still maybe somebody's looking to grab it, on sale or otherwise, so hopefully this won't be totally useless.  Basically, you would want to have this game if (and i'm quite afraid that ONLY IF) you're a fan of racing bikes against trains. The game puts you, a player, into a race with drivers from, seemingly, another universe, with different physic laws, different understanding of what 'smart' is, and so on. The outcomes of collisions here are ridiculous. A head on at around 200 kph would result (well, quite reasonably) in your car being smashed quite heavy. For opponent it would result in slight trajectory adjustment, and he'll head on towards the finish happily. A slightest touch in the corner would mean you're thrown off the track. And if it's you who suddenly crashes into the back of NPC car... well, bad news because it's you again who's thrown off. I was mentioning the trains, right?  And the AI is just brilliant. Its best performance so far is having your partner smack you in the back and kick you off the track while you're trying to cruise smoothly towards the end of in-game 24h of Le Mahn event.  So really, don't get this game. Unless, of course, you like to ride bikes vs trains."
"This game looks pretty, but the controls are rather unforgiving and the track HUD is next to useless. I can understand the degree of understeer that goes with driving cars close to their limits, but when the AI driving the same car does not exhibit the same limitations, then there's a problem. As for the useless track HUD, I often have to do a dry run to learn some the track's idiosyncracies and then restart the race in order to have a fighting chance. In DiRT 2, at least the track HUD is decent and the AI feels just as constrained to the world's physics and cars' limitations as the player, resulting in a far more enjoyable experience than what is offered here."
Game is pretty good...ingame ads are not.
This game does not work with my modern computer. Too bad. Good game.
1/10 everytime i hit a car slighty my car ♥♥♥♥ing turn the other way and gg. ♥♥♥ this game
i whant back my 1.99$ most stupid car game ever made
This game wont even launch what a waste of money..
"Have to say this one is pretty much only for the keen drivers. I usually like most car racing games but this is my second go at trying to get into GRID and I find it difficult, repetitive and pretty much just boring.   If you love 'true driving simulators' then maybe it's for you, other wise. pass wide on by to something else."
"Not worth the money.  This looks great until you actually play it, the physics are terrible the cars are completely uncontrolable as a consequence. I don't see the point in a racing game in which you can't even drive in a straight line. I'd have regretted buying it if I'd paid even a quater of what it cost me."
this game is just awefull AVIOD get the grid 2 instead or auto sport this game is S H I T
"A lot of bugs, sounds, graphic etc. Didn't get it to work."
"Sorry Codemasters. I love your DiRT games, I like GRID 2, but this just isn't acceptable. Never have I come across a racing game (with the exception of Motorstorm) that gets handling so wrong. Even using an Xbox 360 controller and adjusting the advanced deadzone settings and taking off all assists, the game is barely playable. First of all, the interior view is THE WORST around. Not only can you not see anything because it's letterbox, but it looks bad too in terms of detail. The game starts you off with the fastest cars in the world, and you wonder if the speedometer is accurate or trolling you. There is an unbelievable amount of understeer, and the sense of speed is non-existent. The flashback system is very slow and clunky it's actually quicker to restart the race in some cases. Then there's drifting. If you thought Shift 2 was bad, it isn't it just takes a lot more skill to get used to. In GRID, drifting is unsatisfying and broken. The handbrake in this game is almost useless; although it's probably fairly realistic. There are some good points about this game however. It does away with things that don't really matter, such as customisation and having thousands of cars which nobody will ever use. There is a fair amount of variety in the events and tracks too. Also, you are rewarded for playing the game in a more hardcore manner. Everything from no assists and manual gears to only using interior view and even removing the ability to restart races. The difficulty can be set for each event individually, which is great. Codemasters have definitely understood what hardcore racing game fans care about, but have failed on the most crucial aspect of the game: the driving. It's just wrong and unnatural; whereas GRID 2's is practically perfect fit for everyone. I had high hopes for this game, but the horrible controls and interior view make this difficult to recommend."
Okay game. Worth $2.50.
♥♥♥♥
"+Good graphics  - Cheesey presentation - Slow menus - Attrocious handling. Makes the game almost unplayable. Cars are twitchy, feels like you're driving on ice. - Annoying gltchy scratchy sound issues"
it crashed on me playing on grid world race
"I'll have to say this is the worst racing game I've ever played in my life. Don't buy it, ever, it's not even worth it if you get it for free. Unless you are paid to play this don't bother with it. I haven't played a worst racing simulator ever. Cars feels clunky, even on the lowest difficulty you get rekt by the ai, the driver assist isn't assisting you with anything.  Playing with keyboard. But to sum it up, worst.game.ever. Dont even bother unless you're paid to play it"
"  I'm not a hardcore racegame fan, I've played a few games, but that's it, and as far as I see it you need to be a very hardcore fan of carraces to enjoy this game. Casuals and players who just aren't that great, be warned. The there is a fine line between enjoyable immersion and tóó much realism. GRID went over this line by far, in my opinion. The idea that your car can get banged up during the race, seems like a good idea, but as I started to play the game I soon discovered that it's a nightmare. The wheel isn't any more sensitive than any other racing game which on it's own isn't a bad thing, but combined with the previously mentioned mechanism it makes for some of the most unfair gameplay I've yet played. You get pushed off the road by other drivers (which there is no penalty for) and your wheel or engine breaks, making driving even harder than it already was. The wheel is most likely to break and after that all else follows, because when the wheel breaks, your car automatically goes to the right which is very hard to correct. There are no pitstops to solve this issue, so you either finish the race last with no chance of getting back up, your car breaks completely down in an accident you couldn't control or you restart the race because really, there is no way of fixing that. Racing games often play better with a controller, but this game is simply unplayable without one, nothing more to say. "
"If you're looking for an arcade racing game, keep looking."
Just a straight horrible ' racing simulater' do yourself a favor and just grab a need for speed title much more enjoyable
It's a drunk driving sim except the car is the one thats drunk no you. I think you need a wheel or a controller to even be able to stear around a 179 degree turn. Crash derby mode works though.
"This game sucks to crap. Waste of my 7 dollars. SUCKS TO ♥♥♥♥, IF I WANTED TO PLAY A SUCKY GAME, I WOULD PLAY THIS."
:/
"Go to 'Only Negative Reviews' and read those. They are the most accurate reviews you'll see on the whole page. The cars are uncontrollable and make zero sense.   You are literally thrown into a sports car and told to finish the race, regardless of what position you are, which I thought was just a joke (or some sort of 'don't worry, you'll get better' scenario for the newbies.) Having platinumed Gran Turismo 5, I was ready for it. That is until you try and take a corner at 30 mph and your car spins out of control and spirals around 3 times, and you're suddenly last. Or if you want to take the corner at 10 mph, and your car spins out of control and spirals around 3 times and you're suddenly last. Or if you want to drift around the corner, and your car spins out of control....  Basically, the car just does not understand physics or how a car actually drives. I've taken a corner at 30 mph in real life, and I can confirm for you, my car does not spiral around the road like a marble. This is if you're lucky enough to not collide with a single person the entire race, if you do, your car may as well be 'blasting off again' ala Team Rocket from Pokémon.   SIDE NOTE :: If you use MotioninJoy to use PS3 controller, do not try it. The screen flickers uncontrollably and will either give you a seizure; break your concentration; or annoy the crap out of you.  Whatever you're willing to pay for this game, it is too much. Literally any other game would be preferable."
"Playing this with keyboard is super hard. Most cars have no weight to them and have no grip to the track. Even aiming for 12th place can be hard, because just surviving the race is a challenge. Some of the races, with some of the cars, are good. Most are super difficult to complete."
"This game was obviously designed with console controllers in mind. For those of us who can't afford a $50 exessory, you would think the obvious choice for steering would be the mouse. I would anyway. Locking the players into one key for left and one key for right is something you do for very basic flash games where subtle differences in input make no difference. Certainly not on a high end game like Grid. Certainly whey wouldn't make a bone headed decision like that.   (Hint: Yes, they did.)"
"Casual arcade-driving game.  No proper grip or suspension handling, not a proper simulation in any way. Graphics are pretty but again there's no way to skip cutscenes or audio monologue.  There are better choices available. "
SPIN OUT SIMULATOR UTTER CRAP
no way to alter steer controls. this game sux big hairy cocanuts.
This is the ♥♥♥♥ing worst racing game I have ever played.
"after 3 or 4 seasons on the career mode the game seems to be completely aggressive and keep destroying me before i even get 10 seconds in, other than that still a good game, but i recommend people get it on console"
"Worst racing game i have EVER played. I just started a game and they dropped me in the middle of a race and i have no idea how to play. I exit and i try to find a tutorial and as far as i can see there is none (maybe thats the tutorial or w/e but it doesn't teach you how to effing play). So i load the race back up and i try to play and the steering is god awful. I smash into one thing and my car is so ♥♥♥♥ed up you don't understand. After playing for something like 15 min i just got so frustrated at how my car is paper, the steering is so bad(car sweers like crazy) and the lack of tutorial. Biggest upset is the fact that the steering is so so so so bad and your car will be wrecked (not completely but so you can't steer) Biggest waste of time  "
Not worth it given that every single online feature is dead in the water.
"Very good game, but not like game I like. My friends want play game but no game."
it dont start up and steam dont give me money back greedy ♥♥♥♥ stupid game
"it was ♥♥♥♥ and unplayable on the PS3, and its still ♥♥♥♥ and unplayable on PC. cheating AI and unrealisic grip levels only serve to ♥♥♥♥ the player off.   not playing again. ♥♥♥♥ you $developer!  edit: 21/09/2016 steam changed review to positive. CON-ARTIST-STEAM! returned to negative!"
"I tried the demo for this game not too long after it came out on Xbox. I love racing games and rarely dislike any that I play. Within the first couple minutes of playing that demo I was completely dumbfounded by how irritated I was with this game. GRID has quite possibly the worst driving mechanics of any racing game I've ever played.   I spent the first two tiers of the career trying to get used to the ridiculously touchy steering and breaking, and had finally come to actually quite enjoy it. Most specifically, I suppose, I enjoyed driving the open wheel cars. The handling of the open wheel cars is fantastic and I figured I'd repeat them for a few seasons just because they were easy money. I was hoping that there would be an open wheel series in one of the top tier licenses, but there wasn't in the one I unlocked,   Despite this, I finally decided to jump into some of the higher level races so I could earn a bit more cash since I'd just wasted 10mil on a car for Le Mans last season. I spent my remaining 3mil on the only car available for the GT1 series and hired a better driver because I was tired of my previous driver always finishing last (outside of open wheel races).   It didn't take more than a minute for me to realize this wasn't going to work. No matter how hard I tried to be cautious through the corners, I would end up bouncing off the walls, or other cars, without fail. After having gotten used to the ultra-loose controls of all the other cars to that point, this car went around corners like a GD brick.   It was at this point that I remembered the original feeling I had when I playing the demo. I had also gotten irritated by how the cars had driven in other previous events, especially around Le Mans, but my enjoyment of the open wheel series had distracted me from that fact. Plus, after I finished my first race at Le Mans, I set the difficulty on 'Even A Child Can Do It' every time I did it after that because I couldn't be bothered to waste time on a higher difficulty.   While you might be able to find a car, like I did, that you can get comfortable driving, almost all of the races are pretty specific on which cars you can choose. On top of that, there is an extremely limited number of tracks which are used over, and over, and over. Which is partially what made that GT1 car so infurriating. I had raced on that track in pretty much every other series I had been in, so I knew it quite well, and was still unable to get the car to get around the track without the race turning into bumper cars.  I should also mention that the AI are especially terrible as well as unbalanced. Even on the second to hardest difficulty they constantly spin out, run into you, brake way too early, take terrible lines and speed through corners and get in your way. Your team mate AI is even worse because mine finished last in every single race but a couple when the event wasn't his specialty. There was even one event where he would get in a wreck so I would restart the race except he kept wrecking every time. I eventually gave up and let him get his DNF.   The new driver I hired who was much better than my previous one was just as bad. He simply stayed in the position he started in and was just an 8th place waste of space. Not that I did much better, since this was the GT1 series and if I wasn't into the wall and totalled I was trying my best to race by myself and catch up to the driver in front of me, with no success.   In the end, I don't think I could recommend this game to anybody. While it seems like a decent enough game, somewhere around a 8/10 if you don't knock it much for the lack of tracks and cars and the fact that it's a little dated, I just absolutely don't see the point. It's honestly worth a shot if you get the game on deep discount or in a bundle, but you have my warning."
It does not work for windows 8.1. It wouldn't even open.
way to touchy
Having problems with loading game.
game is not launching
"This is a game where you race cars against other cars. Sometimes those cars go in front of you. The online was alright, but it's dead now."
"Is it not optimized, lags even with settings down and delayed responses makes it hard just to drive straight. Unplayable on my decent pc that should meet the criteria.   Steam should give refunds for such issues.  Good luck if you want to take the risk, need for speed works great on my pc.  Why Vegan, Factory-Farm animal abuses meatvideo dotcom"
"This is by far much better than Grid 2, but it is also by far not even remotely a competent racer. The cars are really floaty feeling and the cockpit view is really disorienting for some reason. As much as everyone says this is the best of the trilogy - and it is - that's just saying it's the shiniest poop in the toilet. There are so many better racing games out there.  I dunno what happened to Codemasters, who once ruled the racing genre, but those guys are gone. I dunno what these guys are smoking."
"This is a rant. I have to get this out of my system. This game was fun at first. I guess it was quite fun for a reasonably long time even, but towards the end I've just started despising it, and just don't even want to finish. There are just a couple of things that ♥♥♥♥ me off way too much.  1. The difficulty system sucks. First of all, the difficulty level raises too much towards the end. Naturally a game's difficulty should be raising as you're getting better and as the game progresses, but it should be raising gradually and not too steeply. Neither is the case here. All of a sudden when you're at the global league or whatever it's called, you're wondering if you accidentally cranked the difficulty level up a couple of notches. But you didn't, this is just how the game decided to up the challenge. A ♥♥♥♥ load at once.  Secondly, the difficulty comes from the wrong things. You see, at the start grid they always place you near the end, and the best NPCs always start from the front. And then the guys between you and the people you really want to win drive slow as snails, while preventing you from passing. Also, many of the tracks are so narrow that it's not so easy to pass in the first place. So for the first couple of laps you'll be trying to get past the snails while hoping the big boys haven't gotten too big of a head start, and then for the last laps you'll be desperately trying to catch up. And if you do catch up, the computer of course finds a turbo setting in their car, and makes it go a little bit, but noticeably, faster than yours. If you manage to pass them, they will never fall far behind. No matter if you caught up to them by consistently driving laps several seconds faster than them, they'll now miraculously find a bit more speed and keep up. Their better car (even when it's the same F3 you all have) makes sure they're in the position to overtake, too. None of this amuses me.  2. Music is bad.  3. Voice acting is not great, and the lines they tell are obnoxious. Once I was considerably behind from my teammate, who had informed me that he is leading the race. My business partner or whoever that guy is, also informed me that it's my teammate who is ahead of me. Then my teammate told me he can see me right behind him, when clearly he couldn't see me, because I was not on the same straight as he was. A bit later I caught up to him and passed him, and he then informed me that he is right behind me. He also informed me that he's on the second position. He then went on to assure me that he 'has my back'. In the next corner he bumped into me and made me crash into the wall.  4. Your teammate is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. He barely benefits you at all. Most of the time he'll just be in your way or crashing into you. When you finally manage to overtake him, he apparently loses all interest and doesn't even try to make life harder for your opponents. Or meet the sponsor goals.  5. And what the ♥♥♥♥ is up with the sponsor system anyway? You have to go check and rearrange your sponsors after every race, because maybe you just got a new sponsor that gives more money than one of your previous sponsors. That's some tedious, annoying micro management that doesn't serve any purpose and isn't relevant to anything. It's just there to advertise the companies, I guess, which is lame.  ♥♥♥♥ this game."

It's very tricky to get the wheel settings to work well.
this game was awesomef for the week that it worked. some windows update or something. ive even booted my pc from an earlier date and geme wont play. just want a refund in creadit at this point

GRID  Pros-  #1.Good graphics  #2.Many cars to choose from  #3.Good audio it sounds realistic to me  #4.There is a guy that talks to you during the race trying to help you and he says your name  #5.Multiplayer  #6.Flashback  #7.Replays of the race  #8.Multiple camera angles  #9.Some cool maps  #10.Crashing the car on purpose is fun and cool when you aren't racing   Cons-  #1.It is very hard to control the cars in this game.This alone is why I give a thumbs down.If I drive slow than I can control the car but I will always be in last place  #2.The computer cars go faster than mine when we both have the same car and are both going max speed  #3.Even the easiest difficulty setting is too hard for me.I will be in first for a little bit but I will get to a sharp enough turn and lose control.If I slow down too much I will get hit in the rear.They should of made the easiest difficulty even easier  #4.The crowds are just clones and are not realistic at all    The Bottom Line -  Grid has many good things going for it.It is just a shame that racing isn't one of them.I would rather cruise around at my own pace or try and crash into friends cars than race.The crashing is quite fun when you do it on purpose  If you want to cruise or crash buy it  If you want to race don't buy it  If you want to buy this get it on the cheap as in $7.49 or less   My 2 cents  Dan
"FIX THE DAMN LAG  HOLY ♥♥♥♥  I lost 250,000 and 40 minutes of my time because of two lag spikes, bringing me from 10th to 14th to 16th in my first Le Mans race. I've tried all of the suggestions I've found on forums for fixing the lag spikes and nothing has worked. This is unbelievably frustrating. Oh my ♥♥♥♥ing god."
"I bought this expecting to be able to use the LOgitech DFGT, the game does not work properly with it and requires too much tweaking just to be able to play for a few minutes. FFB does not work, leaves the wheel feeling soft and limp."
"5/10 TL:DR don't ♥♥♥♥ing buy this unless you really are strapped for cash and need a cheap sim racer.  I have been playing racers since I was born and this truly feels like multiplayer burnout with less controllable and durable cars.  The Cons:  Basically you get hard to control cars that are fragile and ai that will ram you if you attempt an overtake simply because thay have no avoidance. Game is a rage fest of restarts because of such.   If you dont turn on driving assists to the max here your car will randomly turn as if it were a plane experiencing propeller torque and spin out like crazy on the smallest turn as if it had no grip of the ground.  The cars are all sonic, the first two races involve 100 kmh in 2 seconds cars, you can't get a feel for how fast you are going unless you turn on motion blur and motion blur means you will be unable to see anything bc it is insane. I guess the devs saw nfs and wanted to also give the player a few fast cars but holy ♥♥♥♥ this makes me wanna commit suicide with how frustrating it is to drive fast here.  The cars ♥♥♥♥ing get destroyed dare you ram them in a 30+ degree angle at anything over 75 kmh, if you manage to survive, they will usually be veering to one side, without being any sort of turnable to the other anymore.  The AI is nuts. they go around slow but overtaking them usually results in you getting rammed and going fully out of control, they do not avoid collisions at all and shrug off any attempts to make them spin out or lose control.  The Pros:  Beautiful graphics and you can run it 60 fps no problem on ultra."
Worst controls ever
This game is bs
restar game all the time
"Much better in mechanics than Grid Autosport BUT, 20fps? AMD FX8530 4 GHZ 8 Core, Zotac GTX 970, 16GB RAM... say what?"
It's a good game but for some reson you just get bored with it...
"While it has a great presentation and has aged well graphically, the physics are complete ♥♥♥♥. Every car handles like an old rear-wheel sedan, fishtailing all over the place regardless of weight distribution, tires, or suspension setup. It's fine for a bit of cheap fun, but compared to Forza and similar titles, it's garbage. Pay a little more and get a much better game; there are plenty to choose from."
"I just bought a race wheel and haved played arcade racer's with it, such as Flatout and the pre undercover nfs games. I am a Gran Turismo vet, and I have played racing games on and off PC since Road &amp; Track Presents The Need For Speed. I use 3 controllers for gaming on PC. Thrustmaster Red Legend Wheel, a Xbox 360 controller, or a usb PS3 controller.   This game is crushingly difficult with or without the wheel.   Without the wheel I still don't do well due to the sheer difficulty of the starting races. I only earned 16k towards the 64k goal in the beginner races. I have just under 100 minutes into the game and have given up.  When I get better with the wheel this review will be updated, and I will put another 100 minutes or so into the game before updating. For now, I cannot recommend this game to newcomers to the race wheel culture, or really anyone due to the difficulty of the starting races."
"Physics arent as in depth as a like but i figured id give this one a shot. It was alright and I was just starting to get into it when I reached $80k to start my own team those ♥♥♥♥ers gave me a mustang.. $80k for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ford mustang, why cant i just buy a cheap RWD japanese car off craigslist for $5k when im starting. For real though forcing me into a mustang has caused me to stop playing."
All grid games are basically spinning and restart simulators I though the handeling in this would be better cus lots of people say this one is the best in the series turns out it's just as bad as the other ones :/ I would much rather play Dirt or Need for speed then this ♥♥♥♥

"I know that it was better than other racing game in pc ,but i hate the resloution of this game"
Great that they know what a tutorial is.
Interface sucks ... instant replay same as steam screenshot

No 1080 Resolution. If cars really drove like this they would all be in the recking yard. Everything pivits you don't turn. Whats with gas on or off at full speed yet corners that you can't possibly make without slaming on the breaks. I notice that none of the NPC's use their breaks or even skid. If the roads were paved in greese this would be what it's like. They have shown that they can make games that have perspective and matching physics. This game is not one of them. Has anyone ever won a race without cheating? I've gone through all the settings and it doesn't make a difference. If you want a fun driving game don't buy this for thr single player content. The multi player without the bots with simply amazing skills missing might be fun. I can't practice in a car that is not broken so I don't see the point in even trying. If you can find a game. Points off for starting default with a frustrating resolution. 2/10 Games Play Value $3.50 The demolition mode although broken does have some fun but not by playing as intended and that's worth 3 bucks.
"It tried to impress me and got halfway there. Much more an arcade racer than a simulator, I found the racing more of a slamorama most of the time with frustrating FFB and wheel/driving control and feedback. Graphically acceptable for the time frame and quite a bit of content. Not one that delivered what I was expecting from Codemasters."
"I tend to turn it off out of frustration rather than feeling acomplished. Work hard to be in 1st place an entire race and then get bumped and spin out at the very end, happens all the time. Wins often feel more like luck than skill. Except for hillclimbs, I do well at those. Maybe substantial game time would help, but that is not worth my time."
"Got it with the Humble Bundle, didn't expect much, was still disappointed. This game is basically unplayable on PC. There is constant lag that isn't graphical in nature, the game just chops up. I tried multiple fixes I found online, none worked. Beyong the lag, the controls are horrible. Using an analog stick gives no benefit over a d-pad or keyboard, there no fine motor control. Don't waste your time."
"This was supposed to be a great game, but the fact it has the worst AI on racing games ever makes it just a waste of money. Opponents keep crashing, ignoring your car specially during turns, always force overtaking or overdefending hitting you. Offtrack car behavior is too weird. No pitstops, even on full lenght 24 hours race, spinning wheels on start gives more grip than non spinning wheel starts, career mode is just too straight away, no chance to pre-test the cars prior to races to learn the tracks... the list goes on...."

"Finally got around to trying this game with my logitech G27.  If you have a wheel, don't bother using it. Controller is the best option for this game.  Traction is clearly scripted on certain parts of the corners. Once I was accelerating out of ANY corner, I had traction and would lose it somewhere around 3/4 of the corner for no logical reason.  FFB is also non-existent. does not give any kind of feel for the car and tires which doesn't help the above traction issue.  Not to mention I wasted 25-30 minutes trying to get the settings for the wheel properly setup.  The only pro this game has is that the extreme difficulty is actually hard. I would compare it to 115%-120% on the default rFactor cars and tracks."
"I want to like this game, but I can't. It is unplayable at higher difficulty levels and the game rewards more for playing them. If you play on lower difficulty levels it's fine - plenty of cheap fun. The AI isn't very aggressive and you can move around freely enough to actually race. Once you start to crank the difficulty level up, the AI starts to play bumper cars instead of racing. They brake for each other, but slam right into you. Forget being able to take a corner without getting spun out by someone hitting your rear quarter panel. You basically end up having to restart every race a dozen times if you even want to finish. Completely ruins any fun you intended on having."
