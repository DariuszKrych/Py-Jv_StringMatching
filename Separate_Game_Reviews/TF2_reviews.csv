"My hours. help.  I wrote something for real!  These hours are legit, I played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life. I was young and didn't really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and I had a really bad pc, which i still own. TF2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics, but it was one of the more fun games I installed. I met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side. The community back then was more humble compared to nowadays. You have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunny/gross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game. When really, it doesn't even matter if you win or lose. However, you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way! Although you never know what kinda person you're going to meet on this game. In my honest opinion, if you want to have a game to just waste time on (and money) or just mess around with people you know (which is what I do now), this is perfect. Esspecially the mann vs. machine co-op. I mainly play that now. Although to me, the game lost its touch, update wise, and I moved onto other games.   I believe it's worth a shot to try it out but other than that, I'd keep it as a casual game. I don't think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because it's being flooded by crude people. Atleast from my experiance after over about 4+ years of playing it just got worse and worse. You will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it. You'll be more stressed than actually having fun, I'll tell you that!  Although in all seriousness, this game is losing its touch and probably isn't worth making it your main game MAINLY because the updates they've been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be. BUT, it's a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun! All you'll really notice nowdays is...people really love to trade more than actually play. Living off as a free to play would be very tough and you'd need to be patient with items you would want, unless you got that MONEY! Hope this helps.   One last thing, I am not saying this game is bad in any way. I am saying that it's worth trying and playing with friends, or even meeting people! Although there are some downsides that you won't like, such as some stuff I pointed out above. Strictly towards the community. I personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing. Have it as a once in a while game, because it's nothing to be big about, unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there.   Just give it a shot and see what you think! Have fun &lt;3"
  This is the cycle of every   Team Fortress 2   player ever:
It's good.
"If you bind forward to a button on your mouse, you can play pyro and eat at the same time"
"The vicious cycle of Team fortress 2  First when you'll arrive in the game, you'll want Weapons, tons of them.  Then you'll see that everyone has hats, and you'll want these, a tons of them.  Then you'll realize that hats doesn't matter, only skill count, so you'll want a lot of skills, tons of them.  Then new weapons will be added, and you'll want them, all of them.  Then a new hat will be added and you'll want it, cause it'll be fancy on your main class.  Then you'll realize again, that you don't give a damn about hats, all is about is skill.  Then when you have waited for 3 years, new weapons will be added, and you'll want them.  And then you realize that you spent like 2000 hours of your life for this, met great friends, and you'll have a server where's you feeling like home, and you discovered so much things via the community, it learnt you so much.  Then the rude reality of life, bring you on earth, and this game is here, Waiting for you to play 1,2,3... hours, and you'll be happy to see that all your good friend are still there."
"How to play Team Fortress 2: Be polite, Be﻿ efficient, Have a pan to kill everyone you meet."
Ruined my life and cost me over £500.  10/10 would recommend to friends and family
"Team Fortress 2 is the most realistic hat simulator created to date. There is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one. The first time you start the simulator, you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items. If you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame, you get your very first hat: the Gibus. This is where it really starts; To play the simulator correctly, you have to spend money in the market place, made by Valve. After that, while you play the minigame, you can find hats which you can trade for, or collect! There is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats, just like you! After you collect enough items and/or hats, try joining a trade server! There, the REAL fun begins! Good luck, and beware of ending up poor!"
"Team Fortress 2. Being ranked as the  third most-played game  [steamcharts.com]  on Steam, Team Fortress 2 is probably one of the best free-to-play games we've got. Why is it so popular? Let's take a look, shall we?  First off, the obvious: It's free. 100% free. This means its accessible to everyone on Steam. This is just the icing on the cake though. What really shines about TF2 is the game itself.  Team Fortress 2 usually consists of two teams (Red and Blue) going head to head against each other. Sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other. There are many, many maps and modes, such as Payload, Capture Points, and Mann VS Machine. But the general idea no matter the map or mode is to KILL EVERYTHING THAT MOVES! And my god, is it fun to do so. The game has 9 playable mercenaries, each actually being a certain 'class'. Each class is divided into 3 different roles: Offense, Defense, and Support. Let's go over each role and class.  Offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team. These are your main attack force. Scouts are the speedy hit and run class, with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items. Soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers, which gives them not only power, but mobility due to the ability known as 'rocket jumping'. The Pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire, as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast.   Defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map. Overall, the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups. Demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by. Heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces. Heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off. Engineers can build Sentry Guns for effective area defense, as well as build Teleporters and Dispensers for logistical support of the team.  Support classes cannot hold the fight on their own, but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their team's favor. They offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game. Whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed, the support classes are always handy to have around. Medics are the team healers, capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments. Spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats. Snipers excel at long range, also eliminating key threats, as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates.  Next, let's look at the presentation. TF2 has a very unqiue art style. It's somewhat cartoonish, but very appealing. It's simple, and un-complex. But it doesn't need to be complex. It's simplicity is it's strength. Everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on, what a specific model or item is, and they all stand out. The soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy, especially the main theme. I personally have it as a ringtone/alarm tone on my smartphone! :)  One of the best aspects of TF2 is the Steam Workshop. Users can submit designs for items and weapons, and possibly have them added to the game! A very lucrative sub-market has also emerged from this game in the form of the Crate Keys. That's a whole different ballgame in and of itself, so we won't get into it here.   During normal gameplay on most servers, you can obtain random items, weapons, and sometimes crates, and taunts....through the item drops system. You can only receive so many drops per week, and you will get them randomly as you play. You can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenary's loadout, or you can use them to craft other items, hats, and weapons. You can take multiples of items and craft them into Scrap, then Reclaimed Metal, then Refined Metal. You can then use these metals to craft specific class weapons/items, among other things. The crafting system is simple yet robust, with lots of possiblities. Some of it is very luck based. You can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the Steam Market!  All-in-all, Team Fortress 2 is just a very fun game. Endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game, especially if you play with friends on your favorite server. Probably the best free-to-play game on Steam.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=383235670     Highly Recommended "
"I think Jerma summed up this game pretty nicely...   'Maybe you got like two Pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago. They don't have any hats, they're spraying ♥♥♥♥ and they're having a blast. They might even be at the wrong point. They might be going backwards to the point that's already been capped.   On the same team, there's a Scout with a Hale's Own Scattergun. He's got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak, he just got 18. He's going 'I just got 18, sick!' He runs up the stairs, he's trying his ♥♥♥ off. He's get *beeping noises* dodging the 'Oh, the sentry almost got me!' He looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on Gorge and there's two sandwich Heavies having a ♥♥♥♥ing picnic. So he stops for a second and goes, 'Two... nnnggh!' so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldier's rocket next door...  ...The two sandwich Heavies then decide to move their picnic. There's ants. 'There's ants here, honey. I wanna get out of here.' So they get up, they pack their sandwiches, pack up their lunches, and their breakfast, and whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they're eating. They get up and walk toward the door to go to RED because they think, 'That spot near the A point for RED is pretty good.' They walk out the door, and they see four Level 3 Sentry Guns pointing at them. They get shot a million times and blow up, and there's like nine Engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions.  The BLU Scout, at this point, respawns, and walks by the at least 3-4 statues because we all know there's four people AFK when you play this game, you go by the museum of people standing still. He walks out the door and readies his weapon, he's ready, 'I'm going to get another 20 killstreak, just you watch Gaben, I'm going to praise Gaben!' And he goes forward and starts shooting, and he gets backstabbed by a Spy that has been sitting with the Cloak and Dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds.'   Normally when I do reviews, I turn into a critic and start to examine that game, pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score. However, Team Fortress 2 (or TF2 for short) helped me make so many memories that if I actually tried to make a fair review on it, it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review.  Team Fortress 2, is, obviously, an amazing game. The teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult. You need teammates in order to survive and win. The graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game.  I'm not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot.     I love this game because of its charm.     The game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters, you can't help to love all of them at some point. Scout is cocky and overconfident. Spy, another one of the characters in the game, is technically Scout's father. Soldier is a crazed WWII American patriot. He never actually joined the Army, but instead, he had his own personal Nazi killing spree. His roommate was a magician named Merasmus, who grew to hate Soldier. Pyro is mysterious, but portrays the world as one big happy paradise, known as Pyroland. Demoman is a Scottish alcoholic who, due to Merasmus, lost his eye that is now haunted. Heavy, although he appears to be dim-witted, is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters. Engineer is very intelligent as well, and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with RED and BLU continue. Medic isn't fond of normal forms of medicine, but is still an important member nonetheless. Sniper is from New Zealand, but was raised in Australia. He prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to Superman's. Spy is the master of disguise, and is technically Scout's father, as said before. Of all the characters, he appears to be the most 'mature' and appears to be the ringleader at many times.  Not only that, but the game has an interesting story. I would not like to get too detailed with it. However, it makes little to no sense but is still funny, engaging, and gives TF2 much more depth. There is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where Mann Co. is being attacked, so the mercenaries have to defend it, called Mann vs. Machine. This game mode ties in with the TF comics, which explain many characters' backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review. The other comics (all of which can be found on TF2's official website) are all funny and charming in their own way as well.  The community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times, but in the end, it's still an overall great community. I've seen people give out stuff, others mentor some of the newbs (something I do as well) along with much, much more.  Yes. the game is considered a 'pay-to-win game' but it isn't necessarily a pay-to-win game. With lots of patience, you will get what you want from the game, whether it be hats, weapons, or whatever it is you want. The game has a learning curve that isn't too steep, but become dedicated and you'll fall in love with it.    No matter how many times you rage to a W+M1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak, or cheer when you unbox an Unusual, or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things, Team Fortress 2 has been a huge part of my PC gaming life and without it, I would be as bored as hell. I cannot recommend this game enough, and I hope that many more memories are made on here.   Valve may be cash cows, but you can't help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games. Portal, Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike, but this game stands out from the rest to me.  Do I recommend this game? Yes, yes, yes, YES."

Want to jump around like an annoying prick who can dodge literally anything that's thrown at him?  Want to use your ammunition to propel yourself across the map at incredibly high speeds and shoot a barrage of high powered rockets in the faces of your enemies?  Want to burn down the homes of those you hate and simultaneously think about unicorns and rainbows?  Want to operate highly explosive bombs and grenades while shouting like a drunk scottish man wielding a medieval sword?  Want to eat sandviches?  Want to carry your team by sticking a life saving device up other people's butts and become the center of attention because everyone either loves or hates your very soul?  Want to build aimbot guns that do all of the work for you while you sit in a chair and drink beer?  Want to be an MLG 360 noscope champion who throws ♥♥♥♥ at people?  Want to use invisible hacks and kill other players in just one hit by pretending you're one of their friends?  Then play TF2. 10/10 would wear a hat again.
"I spent over 7.6 thousand hours playing this game for the past 7 years and I'm still not tired of it.  It's somewhat decent.  unecessary edit: now we have lots of kids whining about the matchmaking update which alters 25% of how you find servers and apparently they think that's the death of the game or something, idiots"
"Played TF2 since Beta. 6 months after release people started complaining the game was dying. 8 years later...only bad gaming communities have died. Best team based game out there. If you think your Halo and COD skillz will help you here, leave now before you are votekicked for not helping your team. 0 pay to win in this game. If you play long enough, if you put the work in, you can get any weapon.  Focus on the objective always. Break down any stalemate into smaller manageable problems with smaller easier to get solutions and you'll win all the time.  Played the TF games for a decade. 10/10 will play for another decade."
"Team Fortress 2 was the final, fatal blow to what was left of my social life.  And I still like it, 10/10 disregard friends acquire hats."

"Into 2010, I learned of a game called The Orange Box. I was a filthy console peasant at the time who only played games for achievements. I booted it up on my Xbox 360 and didn't get what I expected. I thought of games such as portal and half life like stupid creations. I saw that they were probably some of the best games I've ever played in my lifetime. I was dumbstruck with how I could have missed these games for 3 years. After finishing portal, I played Team Fortress 2. From what I learned, It was an xbox live only game. I was disgruntled and I thought it was a bad game.  1 month later, I got xbox live 12 month card so I could watch netflix for as long as I pleased. I suddenly remembered The Orange Box. Out of curiosity, I played a match of 2fort (the xbox 360 version is still not updated to this day and still has 5 maps.) I was bewildered by its gameplay, and intrigued by its cartoonish graphics. I stopped being a COD fanboy due to this game. I remember my first kill was between me and another scout, as we swung baseball bats.  I played it for a long, LONG time. In 2011 I learned of Steam. I realized it was made by the company that made TOB. Estatic, I downloaded it on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC, not caring if it was a virus or not. I would later then learn this was a F2P game. I would be lieing if I told that I hadn't just about ♥♥♥♥ my pants about all the content in it. Although my PC lagged like a ♥♥♥♥♥, I played it in amazement from how different it is, so I sold my Xbox 360. I got a better PC and kept on playing.  I soon used the real purpose of steam and played Hotline Miami, POSTAL 2, The Binding of Isaac, etc. But I always came back to this. Soon I had logged 4000+ hours into this game. I lost my skills from this game and had also lost interest in this game since all Valve focused on was the HORSE♥♥♥♥ING SHITEATING ♥♥♥♥♥ SNIFFING ♥♥♥♥ ROBBING COW HUMPING BULL♥♥♥♥COCKADOOKIE games known as DOTA 2 and CS:GO. I still miss the days when this game would be constantly focused on by Valve.  In the end, I quit TF2. I still love this game and always will, but it hurts to see it barely updated with the exception of patches. I had the dream of reaching for an unusual flaming teams captain, but I failed at trading and it was impossible for me to find good deals. A friend I have who started TF2 a year ago mastered the game in 100 hours. He gained 3 unusuals during his first 100-600 hours when it took me more than 3600. I am going to give him all of my valueable items. So in the end I want to go back to doing what I love, and its to playing many games.  Overall, I give this a game a perfect 10/10, and I'm not being sarcastic. This game changed my taste in all games, and I love it for that. This is why I recommend this game."
"One of the best free-to-play game out there and one of the best multiplayer experiences! Incredibly well balanced and very fun, especially when exploring the abilities of each class. Both the co-op and the versus modes are incredibly fun and unique in their one way. I highly recommend it!  Edit: I disagree with those saying the game is pay to win: all weapons can be found in game through playing. The only items that cannot be found with a free to play account are cosmetics such as hats and accessories"
Probably the only game where no one cares about your skill as long as you have backpack filled with fancy hats to show off.
"This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play. Lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes (each with his own distinct personality) to choose from. The banter between the different classes is entertaining to listen to. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow him to fulfill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or higher skill levels. The game has an active dev team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons or game modes.  At the time of this review, there are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'.  Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objective or objectives for each team to achieve.  'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, 'Mann Up', gives rewards upon completing a 'tour'.  In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available.  In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them.  The game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play. I have been playing since November 2007 and I still return to the game on a regular basis."
You can role-play an obese russian hat hoarder who has mental issue from his psychopathic war experiences. He has a speach impairment and can't prenounce sandwich and calls it 'sandvich' whenever he eat 1 of his 12 a day. Also a crazy nazi scientist who is still mad about WW2 follows you around with a gun-thing that I'm sure gives you testicular cancer.   10/10 would recommend.
Last Revision: 09/29/16   This update in a nutshell  [i0.kym-cdn.com]    Recent Update
"I've been playing Team fortress 2 Since the good ol' days before it became free to play, (I started back in 2nd february, 2010). Team fortress 2 has since then managed to come a long way while still holding the title as best free to play game. Why would i recommend this game to anyone?, Well, I really don't know where to begin.  I've been spending alot of my life playing Team fotress 2, apparently over 4000 hours on it. Ever since i got the game, i've been making tons of new friends from the casual servers as well as some of them friendly community servers. I tend to group up with my friends alot and have some fun within the casual and community servers. The graphics of the game are simple, yet unique at the same time. Team Fortress 2 has an OST made by a wide arrange of people. Team fortress 2 also has a giant range of mods for people who like to try out a different experience in their games as well as the steam workshop support which allows the great big community of Team fortress 2 to also submit their creativity towards the game, Whether it comes in an Weapon, a hat, a Taunt, unusual effects or even maps as well. It's amazing to see the wonderful ideas that the community comes up with. The Team fortress 2 community have designed multiple maps already with unique gamemodes which might give interests to the player if they'd like to try something out of the ordinary instead of just fighting.  When it comes to classes in the game, Valve had made 9 classes which all give the players a different playstyle that suits them as well as an unplayable 10th character known as the civillian. You could be the scout, Fast and quite a big damage dealer for those with a good aim. Could be a soldier, knowing how to rocket jump to get to the frontlines quick and fast. (i recommend all new solly mains to learn and practice this as it is really useful) There is the pyro, a class which some hate but it also has some great uses such as keeping the spies away, can carry different weapons as well which can suit a players playstyle, whether they'd like to play Defensive, Offensive or even try to flank an enemy to kill them whilst they're not looking. There is the Demoman, a class that is a great damage dealer and can also do his own explosive jumping using his sticky bombs. There is the heavy, a class which owns up to its name, Moves slower than all the classes but makes up for this with its large amount of health, Can swap out its shotgun for something to heal it too. The engineer, a class who builds buildings to support his team and also great on the defensive side too, placing sentries in key areas so the enemies cannot push through. The medic, a class which isn't that common for people to main, Medic's can heal player to build something called an ubercharge, Once at 100%, This uber can be used many different ways depending on the mediguns, from invincibility to high damage dealing to just rapid healing instead. The sniper, This class is a long range damage dealer, one that is deadly in the hands of a good aim as well as a well-timed headshot can kill any class if they've gone scoped long enough. The spy, (Personally, this is the class i main), The spy is a jack of all trades class, He can go on the offensive, Defensive or Supportive, He is able to instant kill key targets with his butterfly knife with a successful backstab (Also known as a Balisong knife), This could take out medics, Snipers or just the annoying classes, He can use his sapper to sap engineer buildings which will then become disabled until they're either destroyed or the sapper itself is destroyed on the building. Spies can also go on the defensive too, being able to backstab any progressing targets, whether its a heavy or pyro or medic, the spy always has you covered. Don't want to fight others?, Well we still got you covered. Team fortress 2 also has a gamemode known as Mann Vs Machine, ( a.k.a MvM for short), Which users can team up in groups of 6 (Or 10 on some community groups) MvM has 2 versions of it, Mann Up and Boot Camp. Mann Up is for the people who like to pay to play for a chance at winning items whilst Boot Camp is like a practice Variant version, You can test out what Mann up would be like and what it is you'd have to face upon going into mann up. Mann Up can earn the players unique rewards based upon the tour the player is doing.  Reasons i still play TF2 as of today: +There is alot of people who test your skills in a fight, Only through fighting better opponents will your skill grow. +Valve has managed to launch an VAC Wave, Killed off any aimbotters/Hackers who made the game unfair for others. +Being able to play in the wide variety of custom gamemodes people have designed for it. +Making new friends which i probably have too many right now x3 +Always meeting new foes, making new Rivals who i call a great friend too. +You can always challenge yourself to do better in certain areas, Like rocket jumping, Trickstabbing as a spy, etc. +Valve can almost patch any bug within days of it being found, certain bugs being fixed within an hour or 2 too! +There are many communities based around TF2 which are friendly. Reasons i might uninstall TF2? -Can't think of any -Very rarely finding a hacker or 2 on Thundermountain, but thats honestly about it. But yes, Thats all i can think about to write within this Review. I'd always rate this game up."
The amount of hours I have sunk into this game should be a recommendation in itself. Or a sign to stay as far away as possible. Either works.
I spent all my money on virtual hats. 10/10
I just spent $20 so my gun could flash a color for half a second whenever I got a kill with it. I have played for about 2500 hours. This game killed my wallet and my social life. 10/10
IQ tests should be mandatory before being able to play MVM.
"I'm really liking the new 'If you don't want to play competitive then ♥♥♥♥ you' update.  Bring back the old Quickplay. And no, I'm not going to use community servers. Anybody who has ever been on one will understand how horrible that is. I don't understand why they had to ruin the casual experience to try and force competitive onto everyone.  Edit: Stop with the 'Valve is fixing it' argument. Is it fixed? No, it isn't. Right now Casual is so terrible compared to what Quickplay was it isn't even funny."
"I wasted my life, please don't play this game."
"Ruined my life, and stole my money,  10/10."
Ruined my life and stole my wallet.  10 out of 10 Hats
This game has taught me that you're only socially accepted when you have a nice hat.  its alright 11/10
"I've said I'd quit this game about 4 times now, send help.  [UPDATE] It's ok now, Overwatch exists."
"I'm sure I had a social life before...  Doesn't matter, Hats."
Ruined my life. 10/10  but seriously though. is good game :) best multiplayer shooter on the market. I wouldn't have played this many hours if it wasnt a good game.  EDIT: No end in sight
TF2=hats CoD=no hats  TF2&gt;CoD
"&gt; I was only 17 &gt; I loved MvM so much, i had completed all the tours and had all the botkillers and robotic hats. &gt; One day, VALVe released a new tour, 'Two Cities' , there was a chance to get an Australium weapon! &gt; I spent all my money on Tour of Duty tickets and started playing. &gt; Wasted all tickets, no Australium. &gt; I went to my bed crying. &gt; Suddenly, i feel something move towards me. &gt; It was Saxton Hale. &gt; I don't remember anything from the shock. &gt; The next morning, i woke up naked and saw Australium weapons scattered across my room. &gt; I look out through my window, infront of my house was Saxton Hale. &gt; He looks back at me and winks , then he flies away. &gt; MvM is love , MvM is life."
"There's a point where I can write a review that can be both amazing yet bias at the same time; I hope I don't try to influence anyone by this review alone. When I first got Team Fortress 2, it was an experience that can't be beat. This first-person shooter can't go to say that this is probably the greatest in gaming history. From trading to crafting, this game will keep you on th edge of your seat until you know it's ready to stop playing. There are 9 classes, each that is unique and makes the game fairly balanced, making th game experience even more fun. With all the updates, there are some positive and negative effects than can affect the Team Fortress 2 trading community as a whole, but the whole aspect is to game, have fun, and enjoy your time on this game. It's your decision to buy from the store. It's your decision to craft metal and hats. It's your decision to play, idle, or even be a teammate and balance the rosters. The community is just like this game: random. So if you wish to stop playing other FPS titles and take a break from imbalanced games, then your choice is this: you won't be dissapointed."
Ruined my life. Best game
Made me get excited by bread.  11/10
I swear I had money in my wallet...
How to be pro. 1. Buy keys. 2. trade for buds. 3. trade for unusuals. 4. sell unusuals on market. 5. End up with less money. 6. Rinse and repeat
"No kings, no gods... Only hats."
"I was so excited to load up Team Fortress 2, a cool wacky FPS that was team based and had many variations! Awesome! I said to myself. This must be way better than Call of Duty! As the download was running I sat on my chair eager to play the game, I started searching up some videos on the game and basic gameplay mechanics so I could get the edge on the competition, I learned many things that I could apply in battle! Before I knew it the download was complete! Awesome!  I sat there as the game loaded up, eager to get into a server! I saw a map called 'ctf_2fort' 'That map sounds fun!' I exclaimed, I joined the server and was greeted with a class selection screen. I figured I should play the sniper since my experience in other FPS would help me through.   My first ever spawn! I promptly walked forward out of the doorway and was greeted by a demoman camping spawn with his stickybomb launcher.   I died.  10/10"
Throw your pee at people. Wear hats. Lose your social life. Cry yourself to sleep. Spend 1000+ hours on this game.  Conclusion: Conga Simulator 2014
" The story of every TF2 player ever (Based on a True Story):    Your first day:  You just started playing this cool game called 'Team Fortress 2'. You don't know much about it but you think it's pretty neat, with all these cool hats and accessories.   A week later:  You found a hat called 'Ghastlier Gibus', and It's pretty awesome! But for some reason, anyone who sees you with it call you a total noob...   Month 1:  You just became premium! Yay! And you think you're starting to get this whole 'trading system', but you don't exactly see why it's so important to everyone.   Months 2-6:  You are addicted to trading, more than playing the game itself. You have countless hats, stranges and keys, and anyone you trade with and all your friends admire how extremely rich you are.   Months 6-12:  You've just changed your name to (xxxxxxx) #RoadToUnusual. You really think you can make it as a big time trader. (A bit scamming, of course.)   1+ Years:  You have 5 unusuals, and countless earbuds. You love your inventory more than anything else in the world. Your profile showcase is an exhibit of your coolest items and achivements in TF2.   But then, one day...  You come home from school, toss your backpack on your bed and wait for you PC to boot. You open steam, as well as TF2Outpst, looking for cool trades. You see someone selling a cool unusual you want, so you send him a trade offer. But when you open 'My Inventory', It's empty. 'Steam must just be drunk again', you think to yourself. But not this time... not this time. You slowly, trembling with an odd sensation of fear, anticipation and rage open your inventory history to find out that some scumbag named 'Green Lantern' stole all your items.  -Unusual Counterfeit Billycock -Unusual Shooter's Tin Topi -Unusual Team Captain -Unusual Bonk Boy -Unusual Towering Pillar Of hats -Earbuds -Earbuds -Earbuds -Earbuds -Earbuds -Earbuds -Earbuds  At that very moment, hundreds of suicidal thoughts cross your mind. You throw up all over your keyboard, and start screaming. Just screaming. You break down on your knees, start crying like a little girl and let the tears flow all over your red, sweaty body. You go to sleep, and dream all about your inventory. The purple of the unusuals, The green of the genuines, The blue of the vintages... And you forget all about it.  This review is %100 accurate, I went through it myself.  11/10"
"How to play Team Fortress 2: Be polite, Be﻿ efficient, Have a pan to kill everyone you meet. "
"-Updating my review for the Steam Awards, but generally it's still the same so i'll keep it simple  The Good-  ✓ Still a great game, skill based aim/movement, and old school team shooter gameplay that never gets old,  ✓ Abusrd amounts of customization in loadouts and appearence, you can really make a class your own,  ✓ Diverse, and great community, art/cosplay, community competitive scene with honours and prizes, and a great team game for organized play  The not so good-   X Developed by Valve, so spotty-to-nonexistant dev communication/support at times  X Matchmaking structure needs attention, which they're working on, and a few relics from 2008 that need to be eliminated like random crits and outdated map/weapon design still create problems in casual, but not game breaking ones.  X More community moderation/community tools would be nice, as immature memeing and hateful toxicity hurts the user experience though this is a problem in most popular games.   TL,DR  All in all, 9/10, the good outweighs the bad, and you should definately play this game, as there's years worth of content to enjoy, and even more to master."
It's certainly a game.
"I'm the scout who missed you six times at point blank range. I'm the pyro who couldn't reflect in a mirror. I'm the Soldier who just cannot let W go on a rocket jump. I'm the demoman who does zero damage with the stickies, misses every grenade and then random crits you with a bottle, only to step on my last grenade. I'm the heavy who is dead before the spin up finishes. I'm the engineer who always sentry jumps into the path of the sniper's bullet. I'm the medic you think is going to save the push who ♥♥♥♥s up the uber timing. I'm the sniper who missed that bodyshot on your afk team mate. I'm the spy who missed you six times at point blank range from behind.  I'm the reason the others abandon when I join a MM beta team. I'm kills 30-2500 on your aussie rocket launcher. I'm the pubstompee.  It's been six and a half years for me and I love TF2.  Edit:  Further to my previous comments - I'm not as keen on the Casual matchmaking as I was on quickplay as it seems to take longer to get into a game, but otherwise TF2 is still great.   It's free and it's not pay to win at all, the stock weapons available to all players at start are often the best, other weapons can be earned by completing in game achievements or random drops.   Also, repeatedly killing players with expensive unusuals when you are free 2 play can apparantly really annoy them."
If you are scared of hats dont play this game.
"Look at that hatty. Show me the hatty.  Gimme the hatty. I want the hatty.  Back up tha hatty. I need tha hatty.  I like the hatty. Oh, what a hatty.  Shakin' that hatty. I saw tha hatty.  I want the hatty. Lord, what a hatty. Bring on tha hatty. Give up tha hatty. Lovin' tha hatty. Round hatty. Down for tha hatty. I want tha hatty. Huntin' tha hatty. Chasin' tha hatty.  Casing tha hatty. Gettin' tha hatty.  Beautiful hatty. Smokin' hatty. Talk to tha hatty. More hatty. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
Spent over 700 unneeded USD on the game and lost multiple friends I suggest you get this game.
"Oh how the mighty have fallen.  TF2 was a game where I spent countless hours talking, playing, and generally have a fun time. About 99% of my friends on my friends list including my close and best friends were met through TF2. TF2 has charming characters with funny and interesting personalities. The backstory is funny and the story was interesting. I have fond memories of spending late nights slicing heads off as a Demoman on Nucleus or market gardening people as Soldier on Hightower. Every day I'd come home and play. The multitude of glitches such as the Halloween doomsday glitch where you could leave the map or the engineer crit glitch. This game was a mess and that was what I fell in love with, a mess, an organized mess. The game was fun even though it wasn’t very balanced with the pyro and the old reserve and all, but it was still fun.  The fun lasted a while and stayed strong, that was until the last few months or so. Within the last 6 months I saw this game turn from my most played game to one of my least played (well also the fact that Overwatch came out), and to me that is sad because it was one of my favorites. They killed the pyro class making the pyro twenty times less effective at his job and severely decreasing his dps. I remember when pyros were a threat, now they are the worst class in the game. But that is not what did it for me, I could handle the pyro being bad. This update was the star that broke the camel's back.  This update is the worst update in the history of this game and will remain that way till the day this game gets shutdown. Let’s start off with the interface. It sucks. It forces you to default hud. I do have to give it some credit, it does clean up the main menu a bit, but it removed the create server option so no more Tr_Walkway. Next matches have to be qued and you can no longer play on one you must choose 2 of the game modes and then it will choose your map. Really Valve? Plus ranked in “casual”. That’s another thing, casual gameplay was just pubs and there wasn’t anything serious about it just silly fun. Let’s go to gameplay now. Demo and Soldier are OP because for some reason valve increased blast radii. All the weapon changes are weird. Teleporters are insanely cheap to create. The game requires less skill. Items are now more pointless, and generally the whole game is a mess, but this time it’s a horrendous mess, not the mess of a game I fell in love with years ago. In the past I would have given the game a solid 9/10, but now with this update the game is more like a 3/10. Valve is making Call of Duty look like a cutting edge game.   Can valve fix TF2? Maybe, but the damage has already been done. I had the dream to do competitive TF2 and my friend had the dream to be on the same team as me, but I guess that is the end of that dream. Both he and I are thinking of quitting the game and cashing out, which the chances for me to do so are high. This game was amazing, and now? It is garbage.  It feels sad to leave the game I loved so much and put so much time into. Feels like I’m putting down an old pet. Valve doesn’t listen to their community at all and that is why they suck. If you are a fan of this game I hope you like the new TF2. Looks like I’m going to stick to Overwatch since this game is no longer enjoyable. If you are a new player and like it good for you, but I recommend to stay away from this game. As is has really been turned to rubbish Game Score : 3/10  EDIT: Valve is actively reaching out to fix casual mode (which imo is still kinda dumb) which is good. Lets hope Valve can pull TF2 back out of the rutt they put it in.  EDIT 2: I don't really care anymore many balance changes/ changes in general that were added are pointless Here are some reviews that basically explains things better if you really care  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOHMnySLWKc   http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiplash141/recommended/440/ "
This game has taught me how to wear hats.
Worst call of duty sequel ever.
"Hey here's a review. Read it, you might enjoy it. Or not.  Recently, the community has been divided on the issue of whether or not the TF2 devs and Valve care about the future of this game. People get angry at other people for voicing their opinion and start taking sides. If you think things aren't going swell, you anger people. If you think the updates are pretty good, you anger people. It also doesn't help when someone in the the discussion forums who represents either side acts in the most bizarre or immature of ways, making one side look 'stupid' and just fanning the flames of hate. Others like to cause conflict between the two sides just for a good laugh. This doesn't mean the nuetral side is all that better, as some think that doing nothing helps solve the problem.  And yet even with all the problems within the game and it's community, I still highly recommend it to both new and old players as it's a great game. Believe it or not, this game has endured many bad updates and bad reception from it's community and still manages to be one of the most played games on steam.  Sure, TF2 will die someday. All games do eventually. But as of right now, it still manages to provide players endless hours of fun, and may continue to do so for a couple of more years. And hell, not alot of games manage to do what TF2 has done, so get back to having fun will ya?"
Its ok
  Apparently this game is about fighting with yourself.    After dominating the opposing team and dying once you will see..  'You're now on the opposing team'  .. and it's only 2 seconds left until the round is over.

'THIS ISN'T EVEN A GAME ANYMORE...' -Star_
"Multiplayer friendly, fantastic gameplay, always someone playing, and a TON of customization. Too good of a game to pass up. Best Steam Game by far."
"Best Multiplayer FPS game ever.  Sure, Valve is neglecting it lately. They probably have a very small team working on it. But can you blame them? It's a decade old. They're not stupid, most of their staff is just ignorant of how good their own game is."
"It's ok, i have only played a few hours but I recommend."
"Indulge in the never ending struggle between two groups of players forming two sides in a competitive game of mercenaries battling in honour of two fine gentleman who kin each other. You may engage in a sustained fight between the before mentioned armed forces, as one of nine remarkable gentleman. I shall list them now:  The soldier sent out ahead of the main force and that departs in a specified direction at great speed.  The gentleman that wishes to serve in the military army.  The pyrotechnical specialist person.  The professional of demolitions.  The adult human male that utilizes weaponry of great weight.  The person who designs, builds and maintains engines, machines and structures.  The trained military person responsible for providing medical care to his associates.  The long range combatant whose sole purpose is to take out foes from a far.  And the entrepreneur of sensory shapeshifting with purpose of infiltrationary actions.  If you feel the urge of engaging in activity of enjoyment and recreation other then the aforementioned  battle between these two remarkable armed forces, allow oneself to enjoy the pleasure of fighting against a large group of robots created by the gentleman related to the two previously mentioned brothers by way of sharing the same father and mother, in the game-technique known as 'Gentleman versus Machinery'.   If these game-techniques do not fulfill your wishes you may engage in the activity designated 'Hattoning' where one uses silly headwear to show superiority towards his other colleagues. If you desire to be apart of the community envolving this activity you may have to virtualize your actual medium of exchange in the form of coins and banknotes into virtual articles and units.    I assign this computerised game  5 stars .   TTFN        John Hatsworth "
You get to wear hats and feel pretty. Perfect game.
" I have played this game for an entire year; time for my account on it.   I have logged 3,648 hours at the time of editing this review at this moment in time.  The fact that this game is pushing a decade old, and is still the 3rd or 4th most played game on Steam should hint to you something;   This game is good, and at the price of absolutely free, why the ♥♥♥♥ have you not downloaded it yet?    This game has a special place in my heart; there's not one game that has let me know people from all sorts of walks of life, and get to play with, or against them, or end up being Sandvich-sharing, congaing friends in the end; a game that can hold your interest for 3,648 total hours, and people's overall interest for 9 years, is obviously a game you need to try.  Now, to the core value of the game; this is easily the most balanced shooter out there; this game is 'Pay2Pimp', otherwise known as   pay for a crapton of virtual hats that give you no actual advantage in-game except making you look more suavy.   Everything in this game can be earned by just playing the game, and there's nothing in this game that exclusively a P2P user can get over a F2P user that actually gives them an advantage in-game, it's truly F2P, and doesn't require you to buy stuff to get ahead in the game, unless you want to really get involved in TF2's dynamic trading which is entirely optional but oh so recommended if you like to put stuff on your head.  Team Fortress 2 has more gamemodes than any shooter I have ever seen before; and I  CHALLENGE  you to find a game with more gamemodes and variety than TF2. Along with the core implemented gamemodes in TF2, there are a ton of mods, or other gamemodes made by the community if you get tired of Capture Points, Payload, King of the Hill, Capture the Flag, Attack/Defend, Mannpower, Territory Control, Medieval Mode, PASS Time, Robot Destruction, Mann vs Machine, Player Destruction, Payload Race, Special Delivery, Arena Mode, Competitive twists on these modes, along with OVER A HUNDRED offical maps to go along with these core modes, along with more maps from the community workshop being added into the game over time. You'll never have something you haven't done in TF2.  You have a competitive; intense, action-packed, fast-paced scene, a more laid-back casual, public-server stomping, conga-around-the-map-instead-of-playing-the-objective, four-Snipers-and-three-Spies-on-one-team cluster-♥♥♥♥ scene, and of course, the infamous, yet so hat-involved trading scene with a functioning, living, breathing, striving economy that's just waiting for you to have the next most expensive chunk of pixels in the game. Whether you want to take this game seriously, semi-seriously, or not seriously what-so-ever, you're  GOING  to have  FUN.   Though I may not convince everybody this game is for them, and not to listen to all the hate currently going on; 90% of these current negative reviews are about Competitive, or Casual. Albeit broken, they are still working on it, but there's always the blooming, flourishing community server community, of course. If you feel like kicking back with friends on a server of your choice, on the map of your choice, in the gamemode of your choice do  JUST THAT!  Just remember; the intentions of Casual are meant to be good intentions, not a scheme to destroy the community. It's certainly not perfect, but it's coming together ever so slowly like a giant complicated jigsaw puzzle.  This game is free; there's no risk to trying it. You have nothing to lose, and so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ much to gain, after playing it for a little; I wish everyone could see the magic behind this game, the same way I do. It's really just beautiful."
"Played for 1000 hours. Currently suffering from :  -Minigun ringing in my ears -Inaudible muffling from a gas mask -Handsome french (m)entle(g)en ;) -Developed a fetish for Sandviches - Seeing things ,,, (Pink rainbows and lollipops) -Overly (motherly) Protective of mechanised buildings -Learnt that a medigun has to be rammed up the fat kids butt in order to win -Learnt that Trading causes hair loss and intense frustration  Pi/3.14 Would backstab again ;) (Next stop 2000 hours)"
"The mighty has fallen, killed by Valve's laziness.  R.I.P. TF2 - 2007-2016, those were good 9 years."
10/10 Like skyrim with Hats -IGN
My advice?   Find a community you can call home. Then you'll come to realize just how short 4000 hours can be.
Have traveled across the country to meet the a few of the friends I have made in this beautiful game. Even moved 700 miles to live/date one. Best game ever hands down.
"Valve doesn't listen to the playerbase. Valve doesn't test updates. Valve doesn't communicate with the playerbase. Valve doesn't know the game their updating. Valve doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about TF2. Valve abuses their cult following and makes ♥♥♥♥♥♥ updates. Valve uses TF2 to scrape up more money for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ updates. Valve doesn't care about TF2. Valve admitted to not communicating properly with their players. Valve then underwent radio silence. Valve heard that an item was OP and ruining games for over seven months. Valve later buffed this weapon. Valve finds an item that is perfectly balanced in its usage, and never received complaints. Valve nerfs the item until it is no longer usable. Valve saw that the Phlog was seen as an issue more often than not in it being a bit OP, but not too much. Valve buffed the item extremely.  TF2 has gone to ♥♥♥♥. I won't recommend it until they fix the mess they created, even then, I doubt they'll take responsibility for being absolutely ♥♥♥♥ at keeping their own game updated properly.  I'm sure I'll get told 'dood you're too hard on vulve' or 'it's a hard job you try it.'  Screw that.  I know making video games is hard. I work in a Deli, you think I know how to do anything more than basic programming?  But I ♥♥♥♥ing do my job. I do what I'm told and go above and beyond in serving the customer. When someone tells me I did something incorrectly I don't look at them blankly and ignore their existence and proceed to make the same error for seven months, I ♥♥♥♥ing fix my mistake and apologize.   You can't have a good relationship with your playerbase when you ignore every single piece of criticism."
The best hat simulation game on the market.
10/10 this game ruined my life
"game is mostly the same as it was before.  tf2 is still casual. The game still is unbalanced. free to players still don't know how to play the game. there's still maps that no one plays. there's still maps that are just stalemate fests. there's still friendlies who just waste a slot in the server, there's still there is still neon bright people with terrible taste. there's still people who join just to 'try hard' and ruin others fun. there's still hackers.  But that all fine, it's been like this for years now. what is not fine, is the community parroting stuff like 'TF2 IS DEAD' 'THIS IS THE WORST UPDATE EVER' 'VALVE DOSEN'T CARE ABOUT THE COMMUNITY'  the ironic thing is, the community is killing the game more that any update could do, trashing everything valve does (or not do) telling others to leave the game. and giving the most useless of feedback for the devs.  just because some of the community overhyped an update because a dev said it was going to be 'neato'  and now the game is 'literally dead' because of that.   'THEY KILLED QUICKPLAY!'  you mean what killed community servers in the first place, and that most regions did not have quick-play servers until this update.  'YOU HAVE TO WAIT SO MUCH TO FIND A GAME, CASUAL IS JUST WORSE QUICKPLAY'  Even in my third-world country at 5 am it does not take more than 3 minutes to find a game, yes, it's more than instantly like the old quick play system. but now I can play with my friends without getting auto balanced every 2 minutes.  'TF2 IS NO LONGER CASUAL FUN'  is still just as casual, the difference now that some people actually try to play the objective, shocking, I know, but now the casual servers feel more like tf2 was at release and/or in a community server, and if all of tf2 for you was getting easy kills with no real objective, maybe this game might not be for you at all. (or try playing in cp_orange_x3 servers)  'VALVE CHANGED THE WAY I WANT TO PLAY THE GAME'  no they did not, none of the weapons are banned, nor there is a class restriction. you can still play a 'trolldier' in plr_hightower and play in an endless stalemate, is just that more players are playing the objective and that makes you upset because is not as easy. we get it leddit.  The only thing that is really broken right now is comp, but that only makes like 10% of the complains, and this overreaccion is not how you go about things."
"Team Fortress 2 is like a story about a great wonder child that eventually decended into a family whid two tired fathers. [The 2 Valve Employe's that update the game] Where the Game was feed nothing but the same thing over and over but had great friends that supported him [The TF2 Community] Only fore the two fathers too brush those friends away and tell that boy too become a accountant or some other office related employe.. while meanwhile the Game dreamed about Sky diving, Climbing mountains and vaste ambitions.. only too have those thoughts of 'Fun' slowly plucked away bit by bit by the two farthers that wanted the game grow up how they and only they wanted it.   Team Fortress 2 has had its Golden Age, Over and Over whid those Few Updates that sat the game on a Straight path fore improvement.. only fore the Developerteam too Undo their progress whenever they get unsure.   And this started even before the Meet your match ''Update'' .. that was just simply the final blow that plunged TF2 on a Road that it will have a hard time recovering from too be like it once was.   Despite being one of the most highly played Free games on steam its also one whid the most cheerishable memories from veterans that played it, a way too happily greet new people that has joined steam as most often its teh first game they get fore their library., all in all... Team Fortress 2 Still stands, its still alive, and far from 'Dead'.  But that is not too say its skipping joyfully. and carefree.. Team Forterss 2 Needs a change of developer Staff.  and at this point? seeing the latest Halloween update? the game is not ever going too progress towards another good update the way things are now.   Doing perhaps the same thing they did whid CS:GO where a seperate company creates updates and content as valve has proven they are incapable of this, They either do not have the time available too make content fore the game, and thereby rush it too meet deadlines... So giving the control too others, while still keeping the brand? would only save this Old Wonderchild of a game. from the next 20 Stale Updates that bring !NOTHING! progressive or entertaining too the game.. So its time too cease looking at our game like some decaying cattles corpse.. and understand your very actions you have been taken fore the coming years.. Show some respect fore the game you put 9 years of development into, and the Community that is everyday playing it and just clinging too that hope that MAYBE.. just maybe.. We can open our eyes oneday and see the game some us has pledged 1000's? of hours, some even 5000 hours. OR BEYOND THAT be like how it was when things seemed too finally be going towards improvement. Its almost amazing the amount of dedication that some players or Veterans have towards Team Fortress, and its so sad too see the developers not take notice of the crowd they have cheering fore them too pump out refreshing idea's and content fore the players too enjoy.  Valve needs too do the same thing they did whid CS:GO, they need too grant the control of development over too someone or 'something' that has more time on their hand too care fore this game. and come up whid some new ideas.     ''Team Fortress 2 was great, and is still good, but lets not settle fore a bronze medal this time.'' -Another TF2 Veteran."
"TF2 was a fun and casual game that I could join a game and just play with my freinds, if I had to leave the server I could but now Valve has ruined their own servers making casual into competetive lite. People might just say 'play on a community server.' community servers are full of crappy ad-ons, a bunch of annoying ads that wont stop playing, alltalk, ect. competetive was a nice ad on but they should have not touched casual it was fine the way it was.  EDIT: They are fixing it, which is good."
You can make Weeaboos scream in the mic   11/10
"I'm going to be completely honest, Team Fortress 2 is one of the best free games I have ever played, but Valve just isn't paying enough attention to this game, they just continue to update it because it's a money maker.  I recommend Team Fortress 2 for the game, not for the developers.  TF2 has stood the test of time, but I sadly think it's time is over. Of course this is just an opinion, but this is coming from someone that has spent more than 1 thousand hours playing this game, trust me, once you play for a while it gets boring."
The vicious cycle of Tf2:  Install game Play the tutorial Yeah this game seems straighforward enough Join your first server It's probably payload  It's probably Goldrush 10 minutes to decide which team to join 10 minutes to decide what class to pick The game ends You were too slow Alright lets try this again Join another server Its King of the hill Its Sawmill Choose random team because you learnt your mistake Choose Scout because you learnt your mistake This class is pretty cool Try play for the objective Run into a saw and die What just killed me? Go back to the capture point Get killed by a saw while capping Wtf is this Choose soldier See someone rocket jumping Thats pretty cool Try to rocket jump Blow yourself up This class sucks Pick spy Try capture the point while invis Why isnt is capturing?  Come out of invis See a pyro coming right for you Run into a saw and die Try again See an engineer Follow him for an easy backstab Get killed by his sentry because you don't know how to disguise yet Thats bull Pick medic I will help out my team now Latch onto a teammate and don't heal anyone else Get an Uber Get backstabbed before you can use it This class sucks Pick demo Place stickies on the point What does rightclick do? You blow yourself up Pick pyro Get some kills Find the backburner Get alot of kills Find the ghastly gibus Equip is so you look like a l33t b1g pr0 Try capture the point again  You're so close x2&gt; A pyro airblasts you into a saw and you die Game ends You lose. Return to the main menu Exit the game Go to bed.  --------  Rinse and repeat
Bread  *Edit ~ Ducks  **Edit ~ I want my pyro update dammit!
"Not a blanket fort simulator, was very disappointed."
"It was a good game. Nice casual gameplay.  Then the update came. No more casual gameplay, no more fun. It's dead."
Hats. Hats. Hats. Bonus ducks.  13/12 would spent entire wallet on virtual hats again
"I used to love going to the malls and try on different hats. But I wasted so much gas and my parents would get mad at me. Then one day my friend told me about a hat simulator called Team Fortress 2where you can try on billions of hats. My hat addiction has finally been fulfilled, thanks TF2. 10/10 best hat simulator out there."
Hit a guy with a dead fish  10/10
Ruined my life. Wasted countless hours of my life in this. I'm addicted and in rehab. It ruined my family and social life.  10/10 Best hat simulator ever.
"Team Fortress 2 is a FPS game, developed by Valve, releasing in October 2007 on Steam, Xbox 360 and PC. You are probably going to see this review and think “Why are you reviewing TF2, everyone knows what it is about!” You will be right; however there is a small portion of people who have not ventured into TF2’s world, so this will be for you!   Gameplay for Team Fortress 2 is based around various different game modes, which you take part in online servers. You join a team and choose one of nine different classes to play as. Some of the game modes include the classic capture the flag, control points, king of the hill, and payload – which requires you to move a cart across the map with a bomb attached to it, into the enemies base. The 9 different classes all feel very different to each other, but ultimately will fit into one of three roles; offense, defence and support. Offensive characters are the ones built for dealing large sums of damage to your foes. The defensive ones, whilst these also deal damage, are much more equipped for doing this from entrenched positions, and the support roles add different features to the team with healing or other special abilities which act as a benefit for your team, or a hindrance to the opponents. The classes are all really simple to learn how to use, but can be pretty tricky in mastering the art of the class.   My favourite game mode in Team Fortress 2 would have to be Mann vs Machine. This is a six player co-op mode, where you have to defend your base from waves of AI controlled enemies. In between waves you are able to purchase upgrades for your character to use for the rest of the match. This game mode also offers a “Mann up” mode, which requires you to purchase a ticket, in order to take part in events on official servers, to be in for a chance to win cosmetic items after you finish the mode. Even if you stick to the free side of this mode, you will have a boat load of fun if you can find a team of players and get on voice chat together.   Graphically, since the game is running the Source engine, it looks gorgeous. The cartoony style of art on show gives the game a unique charm and feels which cannot be mimicked by any other game to date. Sound effects and sound tracks are all on point too.  TF2 has a training mode that will ease newer players into the game; this is especially handy for people who are particularly new to the FPS genre as well. This is a game which definitely gets better the better you are at it; and getting better at it only comes with practice. If you find a class you are interested in, and stick with it, you’ll soon get to a point where you are coming top of the scoreboard at the end of the game. Of course it helps to have a little experience with all of the classes because diversity is key in these multiplayer type games, but having a main is also a good idea too.   My play time on TF2 is dwarfed by many, I have only been playing for about seventeen hours so far, and I have only really started playing it properly in the last few weeks, having dropped in and out of it a few times in recent years. Mann vs Machine has really got me hooked on the game again. If you are a FPS junky, this is about as good as it gets for the genre and you will be able to get hundreds of hours of game play out of it before it even becomes tedious. Some people have thousands of hours in this game and I cannot blame them. On top of the huge replay ability factor, TF2 also has over 500 achievements, which should keep even the keenest of achievement hunters busy for a sufficient amount of time.   This game is so perfectly put together from a technical stand point; I have had no bugs, no crashes, and the graphics are perfectly optimized that even when playing on a 4k resolution with all of the settings ramped up to max, I still had a 200 frame rate.   To sum up, Team Fortress 2 is the perfect model of a free to play game done absolutely right. As you may have been able to notice, I have not once mentioned the market and microtransactions part of this game in my review, and this is because I found no reason to ever need to put my hand into my wallet to buy anything. Real hard-core fans will be itching to purchase a few cosmetic items, but if you are looking for a casual first person shooter experience, Team Fortress 2 will tick all of the boxes, and it comes out on top of most, if not all of the recent shooters out there to date. If you are one of the handful amounts of people who have not played TF2 for any substantial amount of time, I seriously urge you to give this game an evening of your time, and let it suck you in to its highly addictive nature.      Tom's Score Card   1) Stay away 2) Not Recommended 3) Only recommended when on sale 4) Recommended 5) Highly recommended   6) This is a must play    If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

"Team Fortress 2 is not just a really fun, free to play, first person shooter with a very large variety of game-play styles, an awesomely distinct art-style and rather comedic storyline. It also breaks a lot of conventions in the genre and has continued to be a proving ground for what a game is truly capable of. For the past five years or so TF2 has consistently evolved through a series of major updates introducing new game-play elements(minor patches for bugs are issued at least bi-weekly), and, occasionally, festive seasonal updates that make TF2 more eventful.  Unlike a lot of FPS out there, Team Fortress provides plenty of things to do other than just 'shot bullet'. TF2 has a really nice replay feature which you can direct, star in, edit, and render in Über quality(regardless of system specs) your own wartime films that can be posted to YouTube via in-game function. TF2 was also one of the first FPS to have a tradeable item drop system which has produced a very large and viable trading community and market where loot found or crafted in the game is exchanged for other in-game valuables like fancy apparel, rare Items/Weapons, games from the steam store, or even real world $ on the black-market. This micro-economic meta-game is what will essentially help support the game indefinitely, and rewards players for there time spent playing the game, and making it a worthy investment for learning the game.   The only downside I can note about Team Fortress 2 is that it is currently over 12 gigabytes in size and it will eventually get much larger if it continues on this upgrading trend. Being the king of free to play games, I give Team Fortress 2 a perfect score 10 out of 10."
The only game where it's acceptable to whip a black man as a white american to make them move faster.
"Wallet vacuum 2015 is a unique simulation game where you are given a list of hundreds of 12 year olds' birthday parties with a maximum of 24 guests allowed and you get to pick which one to go to! Remember, don't play well, but pay well as you are given very interesting and informative facts about your mother's social life and the size of your crotch from intellectual children wearing their student loans as digital representations of hats. But hold on there, tiger, there's so much more! This here is a team game with 9 classes. Your team mates will pick very strategic combos such as: pyro, pyro, pyro, pyro, scout, scout, scout, soldier, pyro, demoman, pyro, engineer, pyro, soldier, pyro, and defenitely not medic because why heal when you can squeal (yes, the E button to call for heals). 'But why does this matter when I can dance the conga in the spawn?' good question my boy! You don't have to leave the spawn! This is called setting up the Armaments Fun Kamp (also known as the AFK) where you can trade, taunt, and even just join and leave your keyboard to show how much you love using up space on a server. Plus, you too can witness the decorative atmosphere known as 'capture points' and 'intelligence briefcases' that are placed in very important places on the map for you to stare at, but don't touch! As best said by xXx_W0lF_xXx 'Why get the objective when you can get kills?' A modern wiseman he is. You can complete your wallet vacuum experience by opening a 'crate o' ♥♥♥♥' which is literally $2.49 to ride an emotional rollercoaster which ends in disappointment and a gun that was good the month before you received it. But that's ok! You can make your pathetic peashooter interesting by purchasing a nametag and conjuring up creative nomenclature for it such as 'noob punisher' and 'looks like ur dead lel Xd'. So what are you waiting for? Grab your lighter and all the dollar bills you can find because this is an offer you don't want to miss out on! I definitely didn't play over 1,000 hours of this! I swear! I totally didn't buy any of these hats I'm talking about! I.... I uh... ♥♥♥♥. 11/10 credit card still has scorch marks."
this game makes me hate myself more and more everyday. 10/10 you should play it
The best hat simulator of all the time.
"Sometimes you just want a game that doesn't need too much thinking. Other times you just want a game where winning and losing the round means nothing but the fact that you've just had loads of fun and a good laugh. And there are still times when you just want to play something that washes away all the ♥♥♥♥ you've taken all day. For all these times, you need TEAM FORTRESS 2!!"
"YAY according to my Mercenary badge, today, October 4 2015, I have been playing TF2 for 5 years and 1,152 hours.  PROS: -expert at engie and pyro, not bad as spy  CONS: -still don't know how to play the piano -haven't mastered a second language -1,152 hours I was not having sex"
"Open Steam, pick your class Saddle up to kick some ♥♥♥! Yer multiplayer dreams come true When you play Team Fortress 2!  Well, the heavy spins a mini gun The scout cain't do much else but run Side with RED or side with BLU When you play Team Fortress 2!  Well, the Snipers and the Pyros might make you wanna ragequit Make sure they ain't a spy though, 'cause spies are f*ckin' b*llsh*t  The Engineer can build cool stuff And Demoman can blow it up A helluva good time waits for you Right inside Team Fortress 2!  If the soldier gets a decent shot, he'll knock you out yo' pants And the heavy and the medic share a legendary bromance...  Work together as a team Download d*uchey hats on Steam The doors are openin' that's yer cue... Time to play Team Fortress 2!  Brentalfloss: /watch?v=UbaGodU_Gkw (subscribe!)"
It's ok. Nice storyline.
"I made a review on TF2 a while ago while all of the Meet your Match drama and hate was still going. I deleted that review and made this one because ♥♥♥♥ it, valve can add casual and remove quickplay, they can kill off a soldier secondary that wasn't even good to begin with but TF2 is still a game I love. Even with all these flaws, I'm still putting a thumbs up for this game. At the end of the day, I love TF2. Yes I have played overwatch but I will side with TF2 in all of these TF2 vs overwatch arguments because it's hard to compare overwatch to TF2. Did overwatch create payload? No TF2 did. Does overwatch have an active community making them content which can be published with a push of a button? No but TF2 does. Has overwatch been thriving for over 9 years? No, it's only been around for few months. As one of my favourite games, it's going to take a lot more than Meet your Match or overwatch to kill off TF2. But before you thumb down this review because I dissed overwatch. Just remember, TF2 has hats."
"All the way from 2007 and still going strong. When I quote, ''going strong'' I usually tend to think so in the community workshop and hat section of this game. Although they aren't the main aspects of this game, but on a serious note, this game is excellent, fun and arguably flawless. So, what's the best of it now? Well, it's totally free and definitely worthy of the quote; ''The most fun you can have online.'' coming from the humble editors of PC Gamer magazine.  The game has a wide and diverse selection of 9 different classes, ranging from their own unique abilities and strategies that can be performed against the opposing team. Similiar to a ''rock, paper, scissors'' scenario, where everything is fair and there are no ''over-powered'' classes. The fast, Boston-talking and even more fast running Scout, to the towering, minigun-wielding hulk of a Russian man, known as the Heavy. Every character class usually represents a soldier in a common FPS' of some sort. What I truly love about these characters is the fact that Valve has openly breathed life, vibrant personalities, characteristics and nationalities into this rag-tag bunch. I also enjoyed the customization of weapons and accessories, named after the witty puns, along with the slight ethnic slur and referenced culture of that said character. This really brings out the comedic flare within the game and shows that humour can mix amusement in along with entertainment the players from around the globe can express and relate to, depending on the gamer's nationality.  When it comes to the plot of the game, the elements of storytelling isn't entirely shown into clear perception. It mainly focuses on the two, competitive industries of RED (Reliable Excavation Demolition) and BLU. (Builders League United) Who both subsequently conquer half of the world, known as the Badlands. Each corporation administers its half of the world with a multi-disciplined army of paper pushers. One of those ''paper pushers'' is you and your whole team, when playing this game.  A fantastic thing to note in this game is the fact that it's holiday themed. Either new campaigns modeled after a specific holiday, down to the newly cashed in, fan made hats are launched to the public to bring in funds for both Valve and the original creator at hand. Halloween, Christmas, Easter just to name a few are a great example and addition to the game's growing campaign and community. It's also important to note that the game is getting updated at a steady pace, with the occasional UI updates and other fun concepts, such as poses and character interactions being frequently implemented to wet the appetites of the individual player's preference.  I don't have much to complain about this game, other than the fact that majority of the servers you connect to, you'll most likely encounter 13-year-olds who constantly nag and try their luck to command the rest of the whole team, which sometimes resorts to foreign/eastern european person nagging about the 13-year-old's nagging, so it's not rare to see a big kick off between young kids and ignorant foreign kids going absolute bonkers on a connected match. It's more fun to not say a word at this point in time and just watch the ultimate climax between the raging two forces.  I definitely recommend this game. Not just down to the fact that it's free, but because it still remains fun to this day and constant updates on campaigns and official hat accessories keep this game alive, making the game overall timeless...which, doesn't affect the game's mechanics at all but, only along the lines of taunts and so on and so forth."
This game plays just like Team Fortress 2
"I've played it so much, I forgot to feed my kids. Now that my kids are dead, I can play more TF2"
It's simple:         Player   Team Fortress 2   No Team Fortress 2       You   :D   :(     
It doesn't matter how many hours you play It doesn't matter how many hats you have It doesn't matter how many kills you have on your stranges It doesn't matter how good you are...  You can always die to a random 10fps m1 + w pyro... He doesn't even know what he did...   Example 
It's like Call of Duty but instead of Doritos you have hats.
"Only played a small amount of it, its good I guess.  worth a try atleast."
Learned how to cook a tomato with a toaster
Still fun even though people don't agree.
i havent really played it but it seems ok
"Pros:  Funny characters  Unique style and graphics  Well optimised (at least for me and people I know, it's not the best but not the worst) Fun gameplay with a large variety of different classes Hackers are very rare (on VAC secured servers)  Nice community  Wide variety of gamemodes and maps Free to play   Cons:   Meet your match update is terrible, it's gotten better but it's still pretty bad Community is starting to shrink   Conclusion: Good game"

"The Meet Your Match update was toted by Valve to be a complete overhaul of the existing UI and the format by which casual and competitve players select what type of game mode they specifically want. What ultimately happened is:  - You can no longer pick what public server you want - You're forced to sit in a queue for at least 5 minutes, oftentimes longer if you don't rage quit by the 20 minute mark - 'Casual' servers have experience but you get penalized if you leave a server early - Since the update came out, the 'item servers' and 'game coordinator' are barely functional - If you wanted to play competitive, you better pay the premium!  Valve has tried too hard to consolidate everything. They took away Quickplay, the server browser, and the ability to jump in/out of a game ... because God forbid you have any other commitments in your life. If you can't sit through a whole 30 minute Payload game without the ability to change teams, you better be ready to get dinged for it.   In summary, the post-MYM Team Fortress 2 is oftentimes literally unplayable –– whether you be waiting in purgatory to join a game, or waiting for the 'can't connect with game coordinator' error message to go away. And when its not literally unplayable, it's pretty much unplayable.    P.S. TEAM HEAVY   EDIT: After I wrote this review, I waited 30 minutes in queue without ever joining a game."
"The average day for a TF2 player  -Join pl_Snowycoast, RED has 4 Snipers, 3 Spies, 3 Engies, a Scout. Go Soldier -About 2 kids on mic squealing about how CoD sucks and their playerbase is trash -Get killed by crits -Get killed by bodyshots from Snipers that our 3 spies apparently can't kill -Manage to get their med at 80% with an airshot, taunt because it was awesome -'Wow a taunt what are you? fukkin 12?' -Get sticky critted by the same guy and he taunts too -Lose the game because all engies built on top of each other -Decide to use my ToD tickets and play MVM a while -Pick 2 cities because it's the only mode other people play. -Have 20 tours, get a Demo, Scout, Heavy and Engie with 150+ and a medic with 3. -Medic heals only Heavy and Demo so I use the black box for some health. -Get kicked before we start round 2 for not doing the meta. -Join another round -Everyone else is 0-5 tours. 2 are Pyros in a map with no tanks -Ask the 0 tour Pyros to switch, One goes Sniper, the other doesn't respond at all -Well he isn't listening, better kick. -'WTF Y R U KICKING ME' 'Because you don't listen'  -Votekick fails but he ragequits anyways -Get another guy who goes engie and does well -Takes like 4 hours but we finish. -For my topscoring and patience I get a Boston Basher KS kit and a kukri spec fabricator... worthless. -'Im never doing this again, it's a waste of brain cells, time and money' -Buys 4 more tickets an hour later -Go to a random trade server to sell that trash you got from MVM. -See 10 people buying cards for 1 scrap each. -3 people in chat arguing about what fanbase is the most cancerous, meanwhile the mod is busy banning a guy for selling a 1.33 ref hat for 1.44 rather than monitering the mic. -Get a trade notif... A guy asking for my strange Sniper skin and offering crates -Get another trade notif... trade holds -Get another trade notif.. oh wait no, someone recieved a Gold Frying Pan AND IT WAS THE ****ING PYRO NOOB FROM EARLIER -Invite some friends to play in the comp beta as solo queueing = instant loss -Get about 3 people and ready up -half an hour and 5 abandons later we get a match -VS all wood ranked noobs, we win in like 2 minutes and gain almost no rank -2 streamers, a hacker and a pro player, and our other 2 have like 60 hours. we lose along with half our rank bar -Group disbands -Go to the TF2 forums out of boredom -Spam thread, 'Soldier is OP' Thread, 'Pyro is OP' Thread 'CoD kids suck' Thread -Omg an actual discussion about TF2 and suggestions on how to improve it, cool -Comments include 'Pointless thread pls close' 'The mods will be here soon' 'Don't post here it attracts more attention' And so on. -Realize that there is no sane part of TF2 anywhere -Wake up and repeat cycle.  The hats are cool though so 10/10  PS would you shut up already about MYM ruining the game? I can still go in a server and do the exact same stuff. Valve is fixing all they can, or should I say, the 6 devs are (Maybe you should be protesting that)  Anyways the actual rating of this game and many peoples enjoyment has gone down more as a result of your pathetic hate bandwagon than the actual flaws of the update."
"Few years ago, I asked my friend to play Team Fortress 2. However he said that he doesn't like the game, stating that the game looks  cartoonish  and he doesn't like its  gameplay .  Last week, he asked me to play  Overwatch ."
"TF2, worst game ever Wasted my time and money just for hats  10/10 will keep playing  On a more serious note, this is a wonderful and amazing game I've spent hundreds of hours playing this and I don't regret it at all.  It never gets old because no two matches are really the same, something will always be different as soon as those spawn doors open and you run out onto the front lines.   There are many fun and interesting weapons that you can combine together that suit your play style and strategies, along with finding the perfect class or classes that just fit your style of play and keep you coming back for more.  There are are many fun game modes, official and custom, that you can play. As well as tons of fun official and custom maps to enjoy. My personal favorite game mode would by Capture the Flag on my favorite map 2Fort. Even though TF2 is 7 years old its still very active and keeps getting update with minor as well as major updates which add all sorts of new content. Usually the major updates are pretty good, but there are times when they can fall flat. But that doesn't happen too often.   BONUS DUCKS!   And of course I wouldn't dare to end this without mentioning the hats. The many hats and misc items for every class allow you to stand out among your fellow players and make you look unique.  There are tons of unique, interesting, and ridiculous combination you can make by combining the wide assortment of cosmetic items and I simply love it!   This game is awesome and overall unique compared to the other multi-player FPSs I have played and that's what makes it so great, it's different and that's the way I like it.  Also, the Pyro is a light bulb until proven otherwise, and even if he is proven to be otherwise, disregard it and continue believing he is a light bulb, because he is a light bulb. Thank you"
I need a life please.
has an amazing campaign mode
1. Install the game 2. Play the game 3. Get items 4. Sell items 5. ??? 6. Profit
 Gameplay
Do you like to simulate wearing a hat?    Because Team Fortress 2 is how you simulate wearing a hat.  Do I want the Steam 2016 Awards Badge? Because this review is edited so I qualify for the Steam 2016 Awards Badge.
hats 11/10 would hat again
This is a good game. You should play it.
"Team Fortress 2 is a really stupendously addictive and fun FPS game. The game revolves around a set of 9 classes, each of which have strengths and weaknesses and counters, whose duty it is to conquer the opposition.  The thing about TF2, at least for me, is the artstyle. The comic cartoonyness of the characters and world is incredibly fun and light. It's the perfect game to blow off some steam and relax after a long day. The players, at least in my experience, are all generally really nice. I feel this is because being 'bad' at TF2 is not really a factor.  Regardless of your skill level, how much time you've spent on TF2, or how much money, everyone can contribute and everyone can have a great time.   One of the strongest parts of the game is that losing, dying or being killed doesn't lead to hate or anger or frustration. A game in TF2 can last from 3 to 10 minutes, and these short rounds contribute to a lack of concern if you lose. Not in a bad way, not in a way which results in you not caring about the game in general, but in a way where if you lose you don't blame yourself, or your team mates, for the loss. It's refreshing and fantastic.  Hugely recommended from myself. I've spent about 550+ hours in the game, am in no way a master, half-decent maybe, and I have no reason to stop playing. The game is consistently updated with new maps, items, lore and content and I look forward to many more hundreds of hours of gameplay.  Nilesy"

"This game started as a class-based combat simulator, capturing the control points, stealing the intelligence from the enemy, moving a bomb-holding cart. Then, it moved onto a hat simulator game, only hats mattered, it was a competition to see who had the best hat. Recently, Team Fortress 2 transformed into a Bread simulator, you could spawn bread with a teleporter, bread was amazing, even bread weapons were released...  But now, it is a conga simulator, one conga is enough to ruin a server.  10/10 must conga harder."
'America's number one hat simulator'
"&gt; I was only 10 years old. &gt; I loved TF2 so much, I had almost all the weapons I wanted. &gt; I would leave my computer on for hours, Just to get a few drops. &gt; Then I got my first hat, The gibus. &gt; Suddenly everything changed. &gt; I no longer cared about playing for fun, I only cared about the 'hats' &gt; I 'borrowed' my mommys credit card and bought more hats. &gt; I had so many hats, I loved them all. &gt; But then someone traded me, I accepted. &gt; They offered an Unusual for all my hats. &gt; It was so sexy looking, I put up all my hats and traded. &gt; But no Unusual, He scammed me. &gt; I lost it all. &gt; I was so sad I cried for hours. &gt; Later that night I prayed to Gaben for my hats back. &gt; I went to bed after praying. &gt; I felt warm. &gt; I looked behind me, It was Gaben! &gt; He said 'This is Gabe Newell' and handed me a Burning TC. &gt; Then I woke up, I was wearing my Burning TC and I was naked. &gt; I saw Gabe leave through the window, he looked back at me and winked. &gt; Hats are love. Hats are life.   TF2: 11/10 Best hat simulator 1981 lol"
"Fantastic game.. until the so called 'meet your match' update decided to not only update the game but completely annihilate the game.  It all begun with a very vocal, but ultimately a minority, calling for a bland yet rampantly generic competitive mode to apply to Team Fortress 2 as well. While this would be a great addition to the game, I stress that making this the ONLY mode is beyond impetuous.  Let’s look at the bigger picture for a second, the indomitable tag for this game is the most fun you can have online. This is something I unflinchingly used to believe in, seeing a spy get panned in the face as a heavy munches down a sandwich. A friendly heavy from the other team throws you a sandwich or a pyro from the other team just baffled by how something utterly ridiculous happened gives you a thumbs up and moves on without being hostile. The moments where you just start laughing out loud happen all the time.  This cauldron of humour is made possible by exactly Pub Games! Where there is nothing at stake for winning or losing and you can at any time change or search for another server with your preferred ping, player amount, gamemode and map. Replacing this with a rank chasing casual mode only will ossify the fun and with that the soul of the game.  Now let me elaborate, as much as I hate matchmaking itself and being unable to join friends in progress that’s not important here. It’s the simple fact that with people being pit up in actual team battles and having ranks, yes even in casual, the serious aspect overpowers this open mind for ridiculousness. Suddenly people are locked in a server and with a set team, meaning if someone decides to go friendly you’re at a disadvantage and inclined to rage in order to achieve that boost of xp.  My main argument with all of this is, since we already have an actual serious matchmaking competitive module in place that people wanted. Why the foray into making a “casual” one, where you force everyone else who DOES NOT want to play it into playing it but without it mattering thus defeating its very purpose and bringing about a existence that nobody really wants at all.  And finally! The cascade of arguments with community servers… Just no, do not be so obstinate and forlorn. Those of you who use that argument have no right demanding any sort of official competitive either from Valve as there’s community competitive modes and matchmaking out there. Oh? You don’t like the specific rules? Well guess what, the very same issues are just as valid for those of us looking for fun pub games. Let me be clear about this. A valve server is like a public park where every player is bound by the same rules that they’re all aware. Meanwhile a community server is like a private yard where the owner can manipulate, advertise or just outright cheat – leaving you there powerless.  Those of you professing exultation are dead wrong, my focal point is how the game has declined in terms of playability and options – which can only be wrong as we all know how toxicity will only increase with the “seriousness” and ranks. Keep it optional is all I wish! We already got one comp mode, fantastic! Great! No need to annihilate the game then with another casual one. Return the pubs and allow us to actually choose ourselves what we want to play instead of forcing us into this limbo. I understand the need to “bring the game up to date” with the generic and superficial traits found in the other titles – but do not rip the very soul of the game doing it."

"There is pretty much a reason for anyone, and I mean anyone to play Team Fortress 2. Let's review.   If you like to play with fire, and not have to seek professional counseling.

"I'm changing this review for the sake of the nominations. That being said, since the new team of developers KILLED the game by completely ignoring the community unless they give them free content via their oh-so-generous community updates, I cannot recommend this game anymore. 7000 hours of playtime, I LOVED TF2 back when Robin was still on the team, but ever since he left, the new team actively destroyed the game and it seems like they don't even give a crap about it. They took my favorite videogame of all time and progressively destroyed it without listening to the community."
"Bring back Quickplay puh-lease. The fact that we can't even join friends on valve servers via ad-hoc anymore is literally the worst thing ever. I love this game. I love the characters, the weapons and the community. But this forced matchmaking update for ****ING CASUAL PLAY is just the worst ever. Please stop trying to be overwatch, you're not them, and that's why we love you."

"I have played this game for a lot of years. During that time I have met a lot of great people, and also quite a bunch of people who I wish I'd never meet.  Unfortunately, I've joined the scene quite late as I first started playing this in January 2011, a point where the game was still optimized and still fun. As years passed by I've seen the game go downhill more and more each update. The performance of the game was getting worse and the content Valve kept adding was not contributing to the game one single bit, if anything it just killed more and more frames on a lot of machines, no matter how powerful they are.  The latest update 'Meet your Match' was the final straw for me. Them replacing pub servers with 'Casual' servers, which are basically pubs with a competitive setting really didn't do it for me. Competitive could've kept this game alive if they implemented this years ago. If you ask me, they are way too late with doing this and I personally do not see a future for this game anymore.  If anyone would ask me, I would not recommend Team Fortress 2 to anyone. Even though I have never played Overwatch, I'd say that game holds a much greater future than TF2 would ever achieve.  EDIT: Well then, to my surprise they're actually doing something about this whole issue. Way to go, I guess?  EDIT 2: My opinion still stands. This game is nothing but a broken pile of ♥♥♥♥.  EDIT 3: I moved over to Overwatch, much better game than TF2. Get it now, seriously."

"  Summary:   If I had to summarize Tf2 in one sentence, I'd say it's one of the most entertaining, balanced, and relaxing games to play.     Pros:   From the moment I laid my eyes on this game a year ago, I literally haven't played any other game besides it. The 3 things that seprate it from all the FPS games out there are it's:   1. Great community   The Tf2 community is very friendly, and you can always find people to play with and hang out with on servers, from group hosted events to just chilling out with your friends.   2. Balanced classes   The balance between classes is another thing that makes this game the way it is. There is a counter for pretty much any weapon, so it's a battle of skill and prediction.    3. Everlasting entertainment    It's almost impossible to get bored of this game because of the hundreds of weapons and styles to play each class that exist, from trolling engies to tryhard soldiers to spawncamping demos. There's also hundreds of maps and gamemodes to play as well, so the fun never ends.    Cons:   Error, not found.    Rating:   All in all, hugely recommended for any experienced or new gamers. Try it out, and I guarantee you won't be dissapointed! 10/10  Edit: Hats make you a pro at this game."
"After playing this game for 30,000+ hours I would just like to say this game sucks."
"Team Fortress 2. Being ranked as the third most-played game[ steamcharts.com ] on Steam, Team Fortress 2 is probably one of the best free-to-play games we've got.  First off, the obvious: It's free. 100% free. This means its accessible to everyone on Steam.  Team Fortress 2 usually consists of two teams (Red and Blue) going head to head against each other. Sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other. There are many, many maps and modes, such as Payload, Capture Points, and Mann VS Machine. But the general idea no matter the map or mode is to KILL EVERYTHING THAT MOVES! And my god, is it fun to do so. The game has 9 playable mercenaries, each actually being a certain 'class'. Each class is divided into 3 different roles: Offense, Defense, and Support. Let's go over each role and class.  Offensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team. These are your main attack force. Scouts are the speedy hit and run class, with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items. Soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers, which gives them not only power, but mobility due to the ability known as 'rocket jumping'. The Pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire, as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast.   Defensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map. Overall, the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups. Demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by. Heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces. Heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off. Engineers can build Sentry Guns for effective area defense, as well as build Teleporters and Dispensers for logistical support of the team.  Support classes cannot hold the fight on their own, but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their team's favor. They offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game. Whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed, the support classes are always handy to have around. Medics are the team healers, capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments. Spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats. Snipers excel at long range, also eliminating key threats, as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates.  Next, let's look at the presentation. TF2 has a very unqiue art style. It's somewhat cartoonish, but very appealing. It's simple, and un-complex. But it doesn't need to be complex. It's simplicity is it's strength. Everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on, what a specific model or item is, and they all stand out. The soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy, especially the main theme. I personally have it as a ringtone/alarm tone on my smartphone! :)  One of the best aspects of TF2 is the Steam Workshop. Users can submit designs for items and weapons, and possibly have them added to the game! A very lucrative sub-market has also emerged from this game in the form of the Crate Keys. That's a whole different ballgame in and of itself, so we won't get into it here.   During normal gameplay on most servers, you can obtain random items, weapons, and sometimes crates, and taunts....through the item drops system. You can only receive so many drops per week, and you will get them randomly as you play. You can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenary's loadout, or you can use them to craft other items, hats, and weapons. You can take multiples of items and craft them into Scrap, then Reclaimed Metal, then Refined Metal. You can then use these metals to craft specific class weapons/items, among other things. The crafting system is simple yet robust, with lots of possiblities. Some of it is very luck based. You can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the Steam Market!  All-in-all, Team Fortress 2 is just a very fun game. Endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game, especially if you play with friends on your favorite server. Probably the best free-to-play game on Steam."

"Nice game. A bit addicting, tho."
it's nice
Played it for a few hours. It's ok.
    TF2 in a nutshell:
"Meet Your Match.   They were going in the right direction with Competitive Matchmaking, but they took a hard turn with Valve pubs and combined them into their own setting called Casual Matchmaking, which doesn't even work most of the time. Searches are slow, you'll be placed into servers out of your area, hackers have still not been dealt with, and the constant unnecessary customization blacklists (weapons, animations, sounds, models, FX, the list goes on). Performance hasn't been getting better either. The game is so poorly optimized to the point where you have to run DX8 for high frames and minimal input lag, and yet Competitive Matchmaking forces your game to run in DX9+. Great.  My favorite thing about tf2 was when you boot it up, look through the server list, find a game mode/map you want to play and join the server. This process usually takes less than a minute. After the Meet Your Match update, now you have to wait in a matchmaking queue for a minimum of 2 minutes to find a game, and that's ANY game mode and map. This may not be an issue in America where it's very populated but in Australia we don't have the biggest audience. There's not a lot of variety in Community Servers either. You'll mainly find minecraft_trade, achievement_idle, UGC-Gaming (which are generally laggy because their servers never restart/reboot), 24/7 Dustbowl/Hightower (oh, boy), Hitler's Jewfort (which is always populated with abusive admins), and that 1% of vanilla servers with hardly any players.  This is what I want from the TF2 Team: Performance and Optimization update, the return of Valve Pubs (which shouldn't be a problem, you can keep Casual Ranking exclusively for Valve Pubs), and updated VAC. They should be working on these problems while the community creates content for the game. I say this because there are already several community updates in the making, and they look very promising. We've got the  Mayann Project,  [www.mayannproject.com]  the  Iron Gauntlet,  [facepunch.com]  and the  Frontline  [frontline.tf]  update. You should check them out.  I disagree with everything Valve has done with the past few updates, but that doesn't mean I don't recommend the game. It's not unplayable, it's just not as great as it use to be. Hopefully Valve will change their minds about their recent decisions."

"Some of the idiots in the review section are about as ignorant as there is, claiming that the Meet Your Match update 'killed TF2' and that 'Valve don't care about the community'.   Honestly, after all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Valve have been going through, I don't blame them if they couldn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the community, most of us are a bunch of entitled jerks who overhype at pretty much everything. Ironically, it's the community right now thats making TF2 lesser of what it used to be.   Sure, I'll be honest, I don't prefer the new system. I think it's clunky and tedious, but unless I'm playing with friends, I go on community servers, so it doesn't really affect me. The reason I'm making this review is to address some of the nonsense being thrown at Valve.  Right now you have 3 options. Casual servers which are basically the non-competitive version of competitive, Competitive servers, and Community servers.   People complain that Casual servers are filled with idiots that don't know how to play. So basically they're implying that before this update, the servers weren't filled with idiots. Team Fortress 2 is still a huge game thats introducing dozens of players all the time, of course you're bound to get people new to the game, but that somehow makes them an idiot?  I do agree however that it can take a while to find a server, whereas the previous system was much quicker.  Competitive gets complains of hackers and cheaters being in every match, and that it's best to play with friends because people you don't know are ♥♥♥♥. First off, I've never seen a single hacker or cheater, and I've played quite a bit of Competitive. I've won many games with people I don't know, and honestly don't see why I'd lose if the people I was with, were actually good. It isn't perfect, but hell it's nowhere near as bad as people say it is.  And Finally Community servers. The servers that people claim are 'toxic'. Funny thing is, because of this update, Casual and Comp servers are much more toxic than community servers, due to people complaining about the most pathetic of things, blaming their failure on other people and claiming they suck at the game. Most of my playtime is spent on community servers, and I've made some pretty good friends on there. I agree, they're not perfect. Some are absolutely horrible, filled with advertisements, awful admins and some are just the centre of scam, but I'd much rather go on these right now, than even touch Casual or Competitive.  So for people wondering, the Meet Your Match update has NOT killed TF2. Valve isn't killing TF2, Overwatch isn't killing TF2, cheaters and hackers aren't killing TF2, It Is YOU, the community, that is killing it.   This is what happens when people overhype on something that really isn't worth overhyping. It's made people completely bitter and pretty much mock everything Valve does, when Valve are trying to save the game. The game is still unbalanced, you still get jerks on either team calling you a noob, you still get everything you got before but you're just going to have to put up with how you play.   I still play the game today, by myself and with friends, and still get plenty of fun out of it, but this update is one the prime examples of what overhyping can result in. I feel sorry for the new players who have to put with us jerks. Rant over."
its alright
it's ok
"I used to love this game but - I am sorry to say this, I truly am because it is a shame to see such a good thing wasted - it is over. ruined. period. What's fun about recieving a penalty for leaving a casual match? I understand it being so for competitive mode but casual as well? What if I don't like the map or have a hacker on the server? Just a few days ago I was being headshot by an ambassador spy hacker and now you are telling me I might be stuck with one of those and not able to leave? The whole idea behind TF2 was that no one gives a f*** and everyone is having a good time. It was never meant to be 'balanced' or taken seriously. It was just for fun and that is what attracted so many people - being able to do bad and still enjoy the game. But as time passed all the dumb weapons, hats, crates - the game became a money-juicer until Valve just nailed TF2 to a cross with the new update. Well done."
"Never played it, but I heard it's okay. ;)"
"Not overwatch killing team fortress2, the 'meet the match' killing team fortress 2"
ruined my life.  5 stars.
I have played this game for 3 years now. I still always end up coming to this gem over and over despite how much I play it.
"This game is really great.  It's balanced for a start.  You can pick scout, and practically do negative damage to enemies on meatshot. You can pick soldier, and choke badly when you sneak up on someone. You can pick pick pyro, and have a hand to spare. You can pick demoman, and break your mouse's left and right click. You can pick heavy, and get high degree lead poisoning from the amount of bullets in your head. You can pick engie, and sit on your ♥♥♥ all day. You can pick medic, and drop uber. Every. Damn. Time. You can pick sniper, and get camped by every spy in a 5 mile radius. You can pick spy, and -OH HOW IS THAT NOT A BACKSTAB!?  Oh... Random crits are still a thing?  Yeah this game's alright."
Old TF2: Was one of the best game I've gotten.  TF2 Now: It's now broken and became a reskin of CS:GO or Overwatch
"When I started this game I played only gibus pyrovision tomislav heavy on hightower and never could understand why people would yell at me for capping the cart... Now 4000 hours later I main engie on silver highlander team, with some pretty awesome friends that I met playing tf2... The most important thing to know is that It doesnt matter if you are the 8th sniper on your team, a pyro who refuses release w or m1, a heavy needing his medic to survive, or an annoying bming scout someone will always complain about something. Enjoy."
"TF2 is the oldest game that I've been playing for a long time ( I've been playing since I started Steam, which was late 2014, to be exact). While Valve has made several ♥♥♥♥ups in the past (*cough* Meet Your Match *cough*), TF2 Still manages to be an amazing game, that's free as well.  PROS:  9 Diverse classes with interchangeable weapons   Several communities (Trading, Mann vs. Machine, etc.)   One of a kind graphics (amazing for 2007 standards, and still holds up today.)   You can get all weapons just by playing the game (You can buy non-stock items on the Valve Store [Not worth it], Buy them for around 1 cent by trading, or buy them with the Community Market, which can possibly count player kills as well [usually far cheaper than the Steam Store]}    Community servers add new gamemodes and maps   You can make hundreds of friends (I've made several for sure)  NEUTRAL:   Most community servers have some plugins (EG: skial, PF2)   Microtransactions (While the game is not P2W, there are some microtransactions (keys) that can be used as currency for the trading economy, or can be used to get said stranges or even 'unusuals', which are hats (or guns) that have a certain 'effect' with them. Some are as cheap as 10 keys (~$18.5) to over 1000 keys (~$1850).  CONS:   Some communities are toxic as hell (*Cough* Jiggly's Fun House)   Hitboxes aren't that good (Not terrible, however)   Since the game became Free to Play (mid 2011), the average skill level (and player age) decreased  tremendously    General TF2 Discussions is a gigantic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  Is this game wasn't F2P, the rating would be lower, oddly.  9/10, Although it's not  as  good as it once was, it's a must get for everyone (It's free!)   Old review for the people who are interested  [prntscr.com]   "
The best game ever
"PROS: - Hats. - Free to play. - Strong community. - Graphics and caricatures. - Community and user-generated contents. - Lifetime support and updates confirmed (it is Valve.)  CONS: - Hats (sick of them.) - Lack of tribute to id and Quake. - Internet memes and half-brained UGC. - More players means inevitably more kids and toxic players, too (statistically speaking.) EDIT: For those typical lowlife kids with extremely low intelligence who fail to grasp the language and understand the review in its entirety, read the part where It says STATISTICALLY SPEAKING. The word kid has a negative connotation especially in gaming communities becuase kids are more likely to be toxic than adult gamers in general. It is the fact that kids are immature and that immaturity is the source of all problems and annoyance so you cannot argue against it. If you are a kid but you think you don't belong to the lowest common denominator, good for you; then there is no reason to get offended. Otherwise, grow the ♥♥♥♥ up and ♥♥♥♥ off. Strictly speaking, this game is rated M for MATURE.  Final Remarks: I pre-ordered  The Orange Box  back in 2007 and I have watched from the start how  Team Fortress 2  (TF2) evolved into something perpetual thingy and Valve's flagship of their both economically and experimentally successful multiplayer game (now of course DotA2 and CS:GO have risen to stand along and they all pretty much surpassed it.) Do you realize how monumental this game was (and seemingly still is) to gamers and even to Valve themselves? Steam Achievement and later drop system along with hats were first introduced for TF2. I remember when hat phenomenon was all over the place and everyone wanted Fancy Fedora so much.  Here is one fun story about the game; A guy from SourceOP known as Drunken F00l got VAC-banned for making idling tool for TF2 and for cheating an event item known as Golden Wrench. Including him, people who used idling tool got their hats and items taken away meanwhile all other active TF2 players were awarded with Halo hats for not using the tool. But after sometime the ban on the SourceOP guy was lifted and he officially started working at Valve for his TF2 Backpack and something more. Well, that guy had talent and Valve definitely knew about it so they decided to hire him in spite of all violations of user agreements as a Steam user. It reminds me of the FBI hiring a genius financial fraudster and there is even a movie about it. So much drama over TF2, aye? You see, this game just has so many interesting stories to tell.  When TF2 switched to F2P model, the community even got bigger and stronger than ever before and it is still growing even after many years have passed. All official updates and endless user-created contents enrich the game; more drops, more hats, more weapons, more maps, more Halloween and holiday events, more updates, more everything, and now skins and competitive matchmaking system just like in CS:GO; OMG VOLVO. And its market is being sustained on its own economy. Quite amazing. I personally no longer play this game anymore because I already played enough of it, but it is easily understandable why this game is still one of the most played games on Steam.  . RECOMMENDED ."
"Here lies team fortress 2   2007-yesterday  just don't play the game, summer sale just ended so play the massive pile of new games you just got! if valve sees that nobody is playing then they will listen, #maketf2greatagain"
It's sort of the reason I have a job I like.
"A long time ago, I told everyone who asked me to play TF2, ' You're never going to see me play TF2. I will never play TF2 with you. '  But one day, one of my friends was feeling down, and he's really into TF2, so I offered to play with him. And it made him happy and not sad and that was good.  Then another one of my friends told me that if I played 70 hours of TF2, he'd buy me Skyrim. I don't have my own money to buy things online with; all the money I make online goes to my friends' PayPals. So I said yes, and I started logging hours.  It was slow going at first. I said to him,  'It's a good game, but I'm really bad at it. And I guess that's okay - everyone's kinda bad at it. But I'll never be like you and my other friends who play this. You won't get me addicted to TF2; I'm doing this for Skyrim.'   After I got Skyrim, it became my bae and I was the clingy girlfriend. As my burning passion for being a male lizardbeast died down, I started playing TF2. Mostly because, being F2P, many of my friends played and still play it. So we played TF2.  It was gradual, my downfall. But it was inevitable, and in hindsight, even predictable. I want to say I'm not addicted to TF2, but then I'd be lying, because once I played for six hours straight to achieve a score of 420 and I didn't stop 'til I hit that eight hour mark. I played TF2 for more than six ♥♥♥♥in' hours, man. I could've stopped at 420. No, I could've stopped an hour or two in. And yet I didn't.  I started playing TF2 regularly, sometimes for long periods of time.  I won't say that  that  was my aforementioned 'downfall'.  No, it would have to be me being around TF2 bloggers on Tumblr. I watched and learned about other fans and their interests.  But let me just say.  Playing TF2 is one thing. Playing TF2 often is part of that one thing. But reading and writing shipping fanfiction about TF2? Getting  innocents  into shipping fanfiction about TF2? Well, I wish I didn't fall into this black hole of gay, but it's too late now.  I'm sorry.   Play TF2.     But do so carefully.      So as not to become what I have.  "
I hope Hell has 100% crits so that all the Phlogistinator Pyros can be punished adequately.
"Hey kids! Remember when Team Fortress 2 was a class-based shooter? Remember the good old times where you could choose the maps you wanted to play on? Remember the good old times where you didn't have to wait 40 minutes in a queue to play a game that lasts about 2 minutes?  Well, Valve says: No more!   In all serious however - this last update is the finishing stroke for TF2. I still cannot believe what they did to this game i played for about two years by now, which i loved and cherished, before it basically pushed the middlefinger into their players faces. This game used to be fun, now it just feels awfully competitive, like a competition really, even in a gamemode called 'Casual' There is nothing casual about any of this anymore.  As I'm writing this, i sit in a queue to play on a map i didn't even choose with people i didn't even choose, get sorted into a team i didn't even choose. The longest time i have been waiting to get into a game was over an hour. And once i WAS sorted in, i played one round which was about 2 minutes long.  I get experience points, i get disconnected, i wait again. Forty minutes until i am in the next game, same scenario.   Honestly, i am thinking about deinstalling TF2 after this. Because i seriously loose all my patience, interest and support for this game  "

  This is probably the only game I will ever need. It's the game that got me into PC gaming and it's the game that has the best community out of the biggest games. Mainly because it's not a toxic community. Just like CS there is so much to do in them because of all the left in glitches and wierd game mechanics. It's also free wich makes it easy to play with friends wich is one of the best things. Thanks for bringing me this game!

"Positive review because even though the wall of text is 100% negative, we need you all to keep playing and voice your opinions loudly so that Valve will do something about the horrible mess they've created.  The meet your match update was a mistake, the community has been in a constant state of outrage, outcry, and complete and total dismay, and all Valve has done about it is put on their fake god damn business smile and say, 'We're sorry. We'll band-aid some of the minor problems right away,' without even acknowledging the one, MAJOR f*ckup, removing Valve pubs and the Quickplay system in general.  Quickplay was not only for Valve pubs. It was also used by many to find community servers. One of those networks that was highly affected by Quickplay lost 70% OF THEIR PLAYERBASE over the last few weeks. I'm talking about TF2 APP. They are shutting down this Saturday. Because Valve won't acknowledge the one major problem with this update. They won't even say 'We're sorry about pubs.' They won't say anything.   If you wanna know exactly how kill your own game, just grab some ♥♥♥♥in' popcorn and watch. The ABSOLUTE most frustrating thing a company can do is completely ignore the entire customer base's main complaint about a product/update.  This is how you drive out old players, and discourage new ones from coming in.  It isn't rocket science, Valve. This game is 9 years old, man. Up until last month, it STILL had a concurrent 60,000 players. We're loyal as hell. We are loud as hell, but that doesn't make us less loyal.  Speak to us with your mouth words, Valve. Use phonetic syllables to make sounds that our human ears will recognize,  ALTERNATIVELY , use your fingers to press the buttons on your keyboard that would make up those aforementioned phonetic syllables.  It's literally that simple. Open your god damn mouths and stop being so silent. The age old excuse of 'we just dont wanna talk about stuff until we're sure it's ready to talk about' doesn't exactly apply here. It was cute when people were asking about HL3. Now we're talking about whether or not one of the top 10 games on Steam is going to die, by your own hands.   Get off your asses."
"played game for long time- here are tips  tip: tuxedo terrorist man goes LOBSTER when using pencil bag and SkyWatching  tip: texas nerd go build tiny shooter when useing robot arm  tip: use fatty at long range when fighting australian longshooter- his gun name of SAZA shoots much faster  tip: the tiny one is very hard to use b/c is too fast- reccomend walk by using CONTROL BUTTON so you don't hit walls b/c you are too fast  tip: having trouble fighting flamer? try demonstrations man. volve™ computer software designed him to DEMONSTRATE (ha, i get it) how fighting FIRE WITH FIRE (irony). Get very close to flamer with Grenad. Launche. (this means Grenade Launcher, I use abbreviations b/c i am a pro player), and fire away. if you are close enough, you should be damaged by these explosions. you might think 'huh, why am i damaged by explosions'? very good question, let me tell you- volve™ realized that demonstrations man was too OP and very dangerous, so they design him to explode after shooting so he can only kill flamer but not the other ones. this game is very clever, too-  remember Cold War?   you might know of tiny little thing name of 'mutuali assured destroction' (if this is too complicated for you it is OK to stop reading here B.C/ all im going to do is explain this and then be done with review) here is the very clever part- remember when i tell you about how demonstrations man explode when shooting flamer too close? volve™ make him explode to remind us of Cold War and say 'science is gone TOO FAR, don't let the explosions get us all'  volve is very funny. i know he is not real (im not a tiny baby boy anymore, jeez) but i like to pretend is real sometime.

"Dis game 2 gud. u shuld get, install, nd pley. rate dis yes if it help u"
"Team Fortress 2 was launched in 10/10/2007.  As years went by,Valve made more and more hats,and people complained that too much effort was given into cosmetic items and less into the gameplay,the game was turning into Hat Fortress 2,and people claimed the game was dying,even though Valve constantly updates their game with gameplay content,like maps,modes,new weapons,and bug fixes.  As years went by,Valve made more and more promotions for pre-ordering a game and getting items for TF2,and people claimed the game was dying,even though you usually can get these items without paying and most are just cosmetic items.  As years went by, new gameplay content was being made more by the community, while Valve focused more into the cosmetic content, and the game was dying because Valve left the game for us to improve.  Pretty much everytime the game gets a balance patch, with classes and weapons being nerfed or buffed, people say the game is dead, usually people that loved that weapon that was nerfed.  On 5/20/2009, a new weapon was showed, the Jarate, a Sniper weapon that is just a jar full of urine that he throws, people complained that Valve was being kiddy and adding immature toilet humor, and the game was dead because of that, also, Jarate now is considered the best Sniper secondary weapon.  Also, the next day, 5/21/09,the game got its first 9 hats,people probably marked that day as when the game became a 'Hat Simulator',and the game died.  To get those hats, many people started idling,don't play the game and just wait for the hats to come with the new item drop system, some players, even made programs designed especially to idle, but in 9/2/09, Valve decided to take away all the items from players that used those programs, and reward the players who didn't with a halo for you to wear, people that got their items taken were infuriated, and the community was really divided, servers started banning people who weared the halo, and there were other servers banning those who didn't, and the game, was dead for many, many people, also, idling persists to this day.  In 6/10/10, the game got the Mac Update, that made TF2 playable on MAC OS X, this angried many people, especially Apple haters, but what made the biggest complaints, were the Earbuds, earbuds similar to those made by Apple, and you got one by playing the game on MAC OS X during some days, just that item made the community rage and ban players that used it, there was a petition to remove the item, and the game was dead again, most people just logged into a Mac to get the item and continue playing on Windows.  On 9/30/10 the game got a store for microtransactions, people claimed the game was dead, because now we had to pay to win the matches, even though we never had, getting weapons that change gameplay is easy, you can easily trade weapons you don't want for one you want, expensive and rare weapons are just reskins, and the cosmetic items don't change anything, they're just decoration, there was a time where some hats combined with some weapons gave you bonus stats, but that stopped a long time ago.  On 6/23/11, the game became Free to Play, people claimed the game was dead because now the game would be full of noobs and annoying players, like if other multiplayer games didn't have the same issue, and like everyone started a good player,some people even asked for refunds like they deserved their money back,people raged because your only reward for paying for the game was an ugly hat that proves it,when you also were instantly given a premium account, that has some advantages over free players,but no advantages in actual competition.  On 9/6/11,Steam Trading came,and people complained that Valve was going too far into allowing people to trade games for hats,and the game was dying.  On 2/14/12, the game got a new item, the 'Something Special For Someone Special', a wedding ring that costs $99.99,goes to two different players and it's a sign of engagement between them,people claimed the game was turning into some sort of dating simulator and the game was dying.  On 6/27/12, came the Meet the Pyro short along with the Pyroland mode,and people again claimed the game was dead due to Valve making the game cute and cuddly and making the Pyro even more crazy than we thought.   On 8/15/12,the game got the Mann vs. Machine mode,and people claimed Valve was being greedy because there was a mode that required a paid item to play,the Mann Up mode,and the game was dying,even though the only difference in that mode is that you get exclusive cosmetics and reskin weapons.  On 1/10/13,it was announced that the original 9 hats from 5/21/2009 were going to be retired,so no one could get new copies of them anymore (Except from old crates),but you could keep the ones you had and trade them,and you could still buy the hats for two weeks before that,the game was dead because Valve was desperate to sell items that weren't selling well,also, Valve never did that again.  On 10/29/13, the game got a unicorn hat called 'The Magical Mercenary', and people claimed the game was dead just because one single hat.  On 5/17/13, the Robotic Boogaloo update was released,a community update,and it was just a bunch of robotic versions of cosmetics that the game already had,people claimed Valve didn't care for the game anymore,again,and the game was dying.  On 6/17/14, people claimed the game was dead again,because of the Conga,a taunt where players can dance around the map instead of shooting each other.  On 10/29/14,the game got some bumper car minigames,people claimed Valve was running out of ideas,the game was turning into Mario Kart,and the game was dead.  On 12/8/14,the game got the End of the Line Update,another community update,it was kinda boring,it was heavily focused on ducks,and the map Snowplow was cut because Valve thought it was too complicated,and people claimed the game was dying,also,Snowplow was added later.  On 7/2/15,the game started having painted weapons just like CS:GO,and people claimed Valve was adding more and more ways to get easy money,the game was turning into TF:GO,and you had to pay for an item to get these weapons and crates to get them, you were paying to get crates and pay to open them,and the game was dead.  On 10/6/2015, the game got the Invasion Update, again made by the community, people claimed the update was boring, not much new content, and again the game was dead, even though it had a new mode.  I made this review 12/3/15, and the game didn't look like dead back then, the peak that day was 56,632 people playing.  TF2 is set to die again with Blizzard's Overwatch,let's see how that goes,people said the same about World of Warcraft and its clones.  12/9/15 came, and the new thing that made the game dead is the trade holds,also called the ESCROW,where you're going to wait 3 days to trade items if one of the two traders don't protect his account on a phone and confirm every trade on it,people even claimed they were leaving Steam.  12/17/15 came with the Tough Break Update, and the the game is dead again because of two things I mentioned earlier, because it's just like the Gun Mettle Update where you have to pay to get the reskin weapons and also pay to get crates and then pay to open them, and because of nerfing the Pyro and Demoknight, when you could argue that the Pyro was actually buffed.  Well,now it's 6/25/16,Overwatch is been on for a while,and the peak today is 64,208,the game is still not dead,maybe I'll update again next year about that.  7/7/16 came with the Meet Your Match Update, and Valve removed their public servers from the game, and their servers only exist in matchmaking, they also removed the quickplay mode, and the game is dead, even though you can still play on community servers and search them with the old server browser."

It's ok.
Let me tell you a story all about how my life got flipped my wallet turned upside town 
"  Although Overwatch is currently dominating the FPS scene in video games, this game certainly did stand the test of time for quite a long run, until the recent update pretty much changed   everything   that was right with the game, and now it's less interesting as compared to before. Sure, there's no special abilities or Ultimates to use at your disposal in this game, but occassionally you'll find the   good   servers that contain players that aren't too serious, aren't too salty - and they just want to have a fun time playing the game.  And of course, there are hats, dancing taunts, 'stealth' boxes , and a ton of minigames to play with in this game.   Definitily a fun game to just chill, hang out and just have a fun time without worrying too much about completing the objectives and what not. I mean, nobody does the objectives these days ~ ever since the 'update' came around anyways.."
awesome dress-up game

"3000+ hours, please send help."
"This game......... I've lost family and friends to this game, its taken over my life, it's not just a game to me, its more than a obsession, its a drug, a way of life to me. I sold 1 of my kidneys, my body to science, shoes, clothes, worldy posessions just to feed my addiction to buy hats and weapons, ive gone so far as to morgage my house, not feed my children, miss countless days of work, FOR THIS GAME 'father, we're hungry, these year old saltines hurt our tummies' 'Sorry, but i really need this hat' The time i spend playing this game, i could be using to better my self, not just for me, but for the loved ones around me, but i keep getting pulled back into the same habits. Do i recommend this game? yes, i do. Do i recommend you neglect your family and friends, just to play this game? of couse I do. Do i recommend you give up your life like i have, down to my last 100$ and pack of top ramen, using newspapers as diapers, feeding off compliments that i get for my hats? I think you know the answer to that question. GET.THIS.GAME  ↑↑↑↑↑ Jk about all of that, its a pretty good game, i highly recommend it, get it 'I dont want to spend the money' ITS FREE! or is that still to expensive for you?"
The best hat simulator around.
I really don't like playing F2P games. That's probably because you must pay every time you want anything. Team Fortress 2 is not like all these pay 2 win games. It's really fun playing it and you don't need to spend 1000 $ per month to have fun from killing other players. For me - it's best Free 2 Play in the world. &lt;3
"Imagine the following scenario:  You and a friend enjoy playing chess. Your chessboard is old and warped, and some of the pieces are starting to lose their paint, but who cares? You two have great fun. Suddenly, one day, someone comes up to your board, slaps away all the pieces, and throws down a whole bunch of checker pieces. It just so happens that neither you nor your friend very much care for checkers. Sure, you'd play it from time to time, but you'd much rather just play chess.  However, your friend suggests that perhaps you should both just give checkers a chance. 'Alright,' you say to yourself, 'This isn't so different than how it was before. I can deal with this.' However, upon closer inspection, there aren't enough checker pieces to even play the game properly, and some of them don't even seem to belong to the same set as the rest.   You are about to open your mouth to complain, but before you can, the person who destroyed your wonderful chess set pulls down their pants and just craps all over your board. Neither you nor your friend are pleased with this turn of events. You let the strange fellow who interrupted your game know that you don't appreciate it when someone violently destroys your games for no good reason, and they seem to listen. For a moment, you have hope.   The stranger leaves, promising to fix what they broke. Soon enough, they return with a shovel. They then diligently scoop away maybe a third of the fecal matter that plagues what used to be a chess board. Afterwards, they wipe the sweat from their forehead, put down their shovel, and clap their hands together. 'There!' they proudly exclaim, 'All fixed, just like you wanted!'    This is the current state of TF2.   I used to love this game. I would love this game once more if they bring back quickplay. I would be perfectly fine with their pile of poop checkers sitting comfortably on it's designated side of the room, but only if I have the option to play chess as well."
"In no other game can you suffer from a multitude of less than gracious deaths such as:   being burnt to a crisp   shotgunned   blown off cliffs   riddled with pistol and mini-gun ammunition   having meat cleavers embedded in your spleen   soddened with expired milk and urine   bludgeoned over the head by fish, bats, lollipops, crossroad signs, candy canes, guitars, wrenches, cooking utensils - the nightmare doesn't end!   curve balled   blown to smithereens by rockets and grenades   zapped by ray guns   crushed by tanker boots   shoveled   pick-axed   whipped   decapitated by various medieval instruments of death   incinerated by flare guns   pummeled by a postal box   mauled   raked   batted out of arenas   hadoukened   suicide bombed   engulfed by an Armageddon   killed by a cripple and a drunk - can't get more embarassing   gibbed by a volley of cannonballs   charged at with shields   glassed   bashed by pugilists   sentry gunned   stabbed with concealed weapons   sniped   fenced   ham shanked   overdosed on syringes   and many other indignities I dare not speak of."

"Gentlemen, This is a review."
"First of all, I don't really understand why this game isn't as popular as for example CS, cause it's basically the same genre but TF2 disposes of much more diversified gameplay part where ingame scenarios are very variable due to 9 classes available for playing. Maybe some people don't like animation-style graphics but apart from this questionable part, it is perfect multiplayer FPS game I ever played or heard about, highly recommended for all CS nerds tired of 'The bomb has been planted'"
"This is a well made, stylised, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play. Lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes (each with his or her own distinct personality) to choose from. The banter between the different classes is entertaining to listen to. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow him to fulfil a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or higher skill levels. The game has a somewhat active development team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons, skins or game modes.  At the time of this review, there are two official modes of play: player versus player(which consist of Match Making, Casual and Community Servers) and 'Mann Versus Machine'.  Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objective or objectives for each team to achieve.  'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, 'Mann Up', gives rewards upon completing a 'tour'.  In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available.  In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them. However I DO NOT recommend opening crates!!!  The game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play. I have been playing 2014 and I still return to the game on a regular basis.  Overall TF2 is a classic but will most likely die out in the next few years unless the development team gets their act together.  UPDATE: This game has me coming back to it every single day"
"'I mean, it's   ok...  ' -IGN     11/10 "
"This game is PC gamer's essential. The art style is unique and appealing. The gameplay varies dramatically from map to map, requiring the player to create new strategies and work with their team in order to succeed. The community is also a nice bunch of people. The game has it's own charm, that keeps a big, goofy smile on your face the whole time you play it, maybe it's the art style, or the personalities of each classes, and maybe it's how the game sort of make fun of itself and takes itself so un-seriously. There are frequent updates that keep adding new items and features that get the whole community excited for a good reason, these new items can throw a real curve ball in the right situation. Lastly, it's F2P! So what are you waiting for, go and fire up steam and download it now, you will not regret it."
"The biography of the TF2 soldier:  A Highly-Trained Weapon Specialist Soldier that went on a killing spree in WW2 (World War 2) that presently wields an RPG FOR A PRIMARY WEAPON joined a team of mercenaries to defeat another team of mercenaries exactly like them, soon, became roomates with A WIZARD that can spawn PUMPKIN HEADED HEADLESS HORSEMANS, A GIANT EYEBALL that shoots exploding miniature eyeballs, A magic book that CASTS BOMB SPELLS, soon turned against the soldier. And one day while on a camp fire he saw a comet that literally landed in front of him only to see that inside the 'comet' was AN INTERDIMENSIONAL PARTICLE SMASHER that he soon used as a weapon. And also one day a crazed man built an entire ARMY OF ROBOTS to take down the mercenaries exactly in the likenesses of the mercenaries themselves, so technically... he can defeat his own self with his own weapons but in the form of metal, batteries, and also probably about 5 TIMES HIS OWN SIZE. Oh and he also survived a winter cold day COMPLETELY NAKED WHILE WRESTLING A BEAR WHILE HE IS COVERED IN HONEY, and when I say completely naked.. I mean COMPLETELY, INCLUDING NO UNDERWEAR. Oh and also he shoots his own rockets at his feet to propel himself in the air. Have you ever heard of him surviving being under fire, comepltely filled with LED bullets WHILE COVERED IN URINE, yes, covered IN URINE. And also he used a shovel to fight a fat man holding a minigun point blank while the soldier is in mid-air who won? Obviously the man with a shovel. I think thats probably nuff said... Theres still more buut I'm gonna stop here."

"You know when a TV show enters like its ninth season and all the original cast and creative team have left? How everybody who actually understood what made the TV show good has been replaced by some random studio stooge who's only watched a couple episodes and turned it into a big ugly convoluted mess?  You keep hatewatching that show. You're too invested now, you have to see the trainwreck at the end. But if a friend asks you if it's a show worth getting into, you suck some air through your clenched teeth, wave your hand side-to-side and say 'Ennnhhhh.'"
"Story: Hats  Gameplay: Hats  Graphic: Hats  Music: Hats  'It's like skyrim with hats.' - IGN   'I once bought a hat, I regret it as soon as I realized that I've just spend my money for a virtual hat.' - My friend  'Spy, the class nobody loves, but everyone wants to play.' - Honest Game Trailer  'You're adopted' - Dad  'I used to be walking like you, then I took a rocket in the knee' - Soldier  'I have to stop playing this game and get a life.... *launches TF2*' - Me  TL;DR  10/10"
Took me a lot of will power &amp; courage to get away from this game. It was eating away my social life. Now I feel like a relieved man. I'm thankful for every minute that passes now without this game. Getting away from alcohol and cigarrete would have been way easier.   10/10. Still in rehab.  'New hats in town.'  ♥♥♥♥. *Self-Control. Self-Control. Self-Control. Self-Control.*  Self-Control? Sounds interesting.
"Will cause you to lose your money and social life, as well as respect for players wearing the ghostly gibus and/or pyrovision goggles. ∞/Hats, would recommend  Seriously though, this is the best first-person shooter and one of the best video games i've played. If you haven't played it yet, what are you reading this review for? Download and play it! IT'S FREE! Except for the hats.  Now excuse me, i have to go and spend another 20 euros on keys."
"You were good son, reaaaaaaaal good, maybe even the best.   RIP TF2, killed by update. We will all remember the fun times we had on you."
I recommend this game to anybody who has a letter from the alphabet in their name.
"  Even though some of the reviews I read is about the community being 'bad', thinking about it, I hardly ever see a 'decent' community for a game, everyone has their pros and cons, it can't be flawless. I agree that it's kind of turning into a CS:GO clone, you can now pick up weapons when they're dropped after someone dies, there's skins of stock weapons, I really miss Valve releasing new Festive skins and I do not like the idea of a Festivizer, and there are no new crates with new Strange weapons, just more cases with more skins and cosmetics and the nerf on some weapons are really unnecessary, it's TF2, not CS:GO, trying to completely balance the weapons in this game is impossible. Overall, it's still my favorite game even though it's losing popularity. Did I regret starting an addiction to this game? Heck no."
"This game was literally a life saver. I had cancer, bronchitis and the diabetes (a subsection of autism) but after playing this game, I can safely say that I have been touched by Jesus himself. You may look at this game and say 'Wow, this game is for dumb bronies, furry feggets &amp; memes' but I can say it is not. God bless valve 11/10"
"Team Fortress 2 is a weird game, and it is not only a FPS game anymore. I would describe it more as a social hub for people to hang out. This game have two teams that are supposed to fight each other, but only in Team Fortress 2 with two people of the opposite team giving each other high fives, stop fighting during the game and walk around crouching, or dance together!  There are nine classes divided into three groups; offense, defense and support. But Team Fortress 2 have changed so much since release that it does not really mean anything anymore. Pretty much every class can function as any of the three groups with the right loadout, but they are still very different from each other. You got a fast Scout with little health, and a slow Heavy with a lot of health, and anything inbetween that! There is no way you will not find a class you prefer sticking to.  Valve never added a new class, but they added tons of weapons! Some of them are really silly (punch an enemy in the back to make him stop and laugh, a great way to get silly taunt kills!), while others generally are a big improvement over the stock weapons (like the Degreaser). However most of the weapons are very situational and I prefer the stock weapons.  There are many game modes to play. Capture the point, capture the flag. Payload where you push a cart through the map while the other team try preventing you from doing it, and if you're a fan of tower defense, you will enjoy Mann Vs. Machine! You're a team of up to six people who are supposed to kill a huge army of robots before they move their bomb to your base. Some of them are small, others are big and really hurts, and others are big and runs fast. But what really makes this game mode different from the more traditional Team Fortress 2, is you can upgrade your weapons. Fire speed, damage, reload speed, damage resistances, running speed, jump speed and so on. It is really fun, and if you are lucky you can win a huge prize for completing a Tour!  Cosmetic items are a huge deal for many people. Hats! There are so many hats in this game, and they are all so different. There is no way you are not going to find one you like and will wear and be proud to wear every time you play. Many of the cosmetics can also be painted into your favourite colour!  Team Fortress 2 is free to play. Is it pay to win? No. All the weapons you see in the store, are weapons you can get simply by playing, or you can use items to craft the weapon you want. If you buy premium you will receive weapons faster, your backpack will be larger so you can keep more items, and you can trade with others. Trading is a good way to get the weapon you're looking for.  It is a lot of fun! It is fun to play the actual game, or just hanging out with people ingame like you can not do in any other game. This is the game where you make friends! ^____^"
" This is an edit of my review posted on Feb 24, 2016. This review is also super-serious and intellectual. You have been warned."
"Pros :  - Fast action - Many classes to play - You can choose if you want to be tactical or raw - Simple gameplay and friendly-user interface - Needs teamwork - Frequent updates, improving perfomance and adding new material - Free - Events - No Pay-to-Win - Strong Community - Nice cartoon-like graphics  Cons :  - It will drain your soul slowly and painfully, if you decide to play for serious.

"Good afternoon, dear gentlemen and gentlewomen  It is a pleasure to perceive that one such as yourself would partake in my review of this most splendorous game.  I say this for it is the most honest and veritable truth. Quite close to the objective Idea of Truth, to estimate it properly.   At first I held the opinion that Collective Fortification II was merely another dull, boring and uninteresting ludum of the general significance and craftsmanship as Summoning of Obligation.  However, this was in advance of the actual attempt at undergoing the experience of Collective Fortification II, which is, in hindsight, presumptuous and bold.   Contrary to whatever estimation I conferred to Collective Fortification II in the past before, mind you, partaking in the adventure that is Collective Fortification II, I must declare with due expertise that this ludum is marvelous!  In this ludum one will find a most engaging experience worthy of eternal estimation in the irrefutable and absolute realm of Do Desire.   Certainly, anyone who would claim that this ludum is not worthy of said realm would be a scoundrel, a fraud and a lout.   Yes, the sheer dilly-dallying that is facilitated in this ludum is thus charming that one such as I, one who could be described as paresseux comme baise, would scribe a true pinnacle of summitous apexity in the latitudes of criticisms.   And thus, at the decisive terminal of this criticism I would implore you, my venerable gentleman or gentlewoman, to amuse yourself with this ludum of exceptional excellence.   Now, my treasured asinine, experience the wonder that is Collective Fortification II with your personal senses by embarking on the quest that is this ludum!   Godspeed and have a good evening by now.   Best regards,  MLAnonymous"
"4288 hours, help me ;__;   i can't live w/o tf2     but its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game   "
This game has destroyed my life. I don't buy games anymore. All I want to buy is hats. I've spent countless dollars on this game. I have a serious problem. I just keep needing hats to fill the void. This game consumes your soul and replaces it with a rabid craving for earbuds and keys. Send help.  10/10 Would recommend to random hobos on the street
  The meet your match update.
"Ok so I had this mad hat and through the fire and demos I ran into the capture point, because you know, that is what you do in doing the game playing of this game. You kill the annoying spies that kill the campers snipahs and avoid the pie-rews' flame. All in the days job. Tick tock. Time goes by and I relise havent eaten any food for 8 hours. Sleep. Eh, who needs it. I am really hungry though. A sandwich would be nice. *bonks head on monitor*. Maybe I should buy a new hat. Wait killstreak my Scottish Resistance. Oh em gee. Yes. Oh noes. Out of real world moneh. Gawgdanngit.   I would say stay away from this game like the thing that you stay well away from but I am gonna say get on the point ya half wit! Ehhhalbeegit! Drunk +1 rekt mishun beguns in sexty seconds yoo"
It's ok
THAT HEAVY IS A SPY   I'm not 12 and I still enjoy this hunk of a game 9/10 would bang. I would like to push forth with my in-game friend and capture the flag then return it to our home base to be rewarded with critical hits.  If you haven't played this game for at least 500 hours you're probably a virgin in real life and I most likely hate you.  Enjoy!
"This game is cool.   How to be pro- 1. Get 100$ and buy ♥♥♥♥ tons of keys 2. Wait for em to become tradable 3. Buy Unusuals,Australium, if you don't have enough keys, Add more Funds. 4. get burning unusuals/ scorching 5. go to farming server and rank up your australium to hale's own 6. go to random server, and people will praise you  Such good game  I rate it 9/11 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) "
Ruined my life since 2011.  11/10 would play again   EDIT: It really hurts to quit this game after 4.5+k hours.
I wish I knew how to quit you.
"Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is one the games that you really have to try, it is Free to Play (F2P) and has an outstanding unique first-person shooter (FPS) style. Unlike most FPS that is played competitively, it focuses more on fun and especially humor. TF2 has a various types of character classes and game modes, a bunch of maps and hats (yes you read it right, HATS!).   Gameplay"
"Ah, tf2. Best game I've ever seen in my life. When I started playing tf2, I only played it for the gameplay. It was (and still is) real fun to play. But after some months, I discovered trading. The wonderful trading. After months of trading, I learned a lot about it. And now, I do it almost every day! It will always be my hobby. c: It's even a great way to earn money! :D I have to say, there aren't that much weapons. There are more cosmetics then weapons. I'm not really a fan of cosmetics, I prefer have weapons (that's why I almost have them all, except 5). And when there comes new items during an update, then that are only cosmetics/reskins of weapons/weapons in an other quality. For now the qualities that are coming more of: Strange and Collector's. Collector's is a new, and pretty expensive quality, but not really diffirent then the 'unique' quality. And Strange is a quality that counts kills/points/etc that you made with the weapon/misc that's in this quality. I'm a truly fan of Strange weapons, and I own 41 out of 120 (this is except Australiums, Botkillers and Festives, because that are 'just' reskins) Someday I'll buy the rest of them too :D Alright, I told pretty much I guess, and I hope this review was useful for you. Thanks for reading and enjoy playing tf2!  - Wario_16, 2014."
"The Second Fortress of Team is a roleplaying rpg. If you can see around this game's high price, I'm sure you'll be able to enjoy the stunning, photorealistic and colourful graphics this game gives. Based heavily on realism, Second Team Fortress is a very tough game to learn with all of the realistic gun mechanics. It improves on its strick mechanics by allowing the player get killstreaks after a certain number of kills.  I give Call of Fortress 2 a Treyarch of an Activision."
"Hats = Skill Going outside or spending less than 25 hours a day playing = F2P Being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with other players and bragging about your expensive ugly hats = Pro  If you have no money to waste on virtual crap, you suck at this game and should quit it forever. Shitbuckets recommended for a better gameplay."
"Played this game for 500 ours and loved it so freakin' much, you can not believe! But now, eh.. That's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I can't say something else, because it's only one word to explain this. Overwhatch will not kill TF2, because Gabe already did. - You can not choose team - You can not find server by yourself - You can not leave the game, while it's going - You will waste 1000000000 ours to join the server - You can not have fun - You can not do anything you want Can't play this game anymore. Just give me my old lovely Team Fortress 2."
"This game was the 2nd game I got when I first got steam. It is the best game and I am always laughing while playing. It may be an old game, but it's still my favorite.  10/10"
"Basic steps to be a professional tf2 player: -Install it. -Join a payload server. -Dominate a gibus sniper. -Equip your brand new, extremely, incredible, mega-plasma-hyper 5000 hat. -Speak english in voicechat with an awful swedish accent. -Beg for cosmetics. -Do your best! Why dance conga with that unusual-soldier when you can kill him and get a whole point for it!?    When you played the game for a while and almost mastered it, you're ready for the next step:  Paint all your cosmetics that you got from begging with 'A bitter taste of defeat and lime' or 'Pink as Hell'.    Hope this helps you on your great journey in Teufort!!!"
"This is a dumb game. It's stupid, immature, repetitive. It is also a huge excuse to suck your wallet dry with dress up items, and i absolutely LOVE it."
"If you have a hat fetish, then this is better than any hat-porn you'll ever find, also; nice group dances can give you a romantic atmosphere if you're into that kind of porn. Pro's: -Enjoyable with friends -Hats, like seriously, who doesn't like hats Con's: -People who think you're weird for having a hat fetish, it's normal, just let them talk. "
"TF2 used to be a Overall amazing game. Great Community, Servers, Gamemodes, and just a Great Game. Now, TF2's New update: Meet your Match, has made TF2 completly awful. I have many reasons on why this update made people dislike TF2 now. Reason 1: The menu The new Menu for TF2 is just the start of it. Everything has been moved around into 'Find Game'. Which i can't even find anything now. Reason 2: Casual Casual, The main Reason TF2 is going down. You have to wait like 30 minuets to find a game. But when you get into a match, its even more bad, everyone is a Tryhard, you cant even play your favorite gamemode/map anymore. You can't find the map you want to play anymore. and if you Leave the game you are in, You get a Penalty, Really? Reason 3: Balance Changes To be really honest, These changes were not Really Necessary. Eventhough the New ShortStop Alt-Fire is pretty cool, along with the +20 speed boost for Spy is cool, it was not Needed. Reason 4: The Modles While i was playing Casual (Which i did not enjoy), The Spy Modle was Really Broken, same with the Items. Reason 5: Reskins These reskins were Not Necessary either, eventhough they look funny, you cant see anything cause of the Sign on the side of the Jumpers. Overall: Valve has made amazing Updates in their past, But this Update was awful. They could have done the Iron Gauntlet or the MayMann Update, but i guess Valve said ♥♥♥♥ you To the Community. If you want to play TF2 now, you're gonna have to accept this very Awful Update. "
One of the saltiest communities out there.  10/10
"How to play this game: Play 100 hours figuring out what each class does and how dead ringer works ( it doesnt make you invisible at first someone has to hit you to activate you ( i deleted it when i got it because of that) ) 100-200 hours you start thinking that youre good at this game but you dont have any hats and people still call you a noob 200-500 you play the game casually start watching youtube vidyas/ twitch streams and tried trading 500-1000 trying really hard in pubs (*casual) Might have watched all sterma tf2 videous 1000+ you start getting in competitive, or at least got a good rank in matchmaking 10000+ you are probably a virgin and you should play other games too (hey b4nny)"
"Whipped a 10 year old kid to death while dressed as Santa, then blew up his friend and didn't get arrested 10/10, It's alright."
"In this game helping your team (collect hats) is vital to ensure victory in the (tryhard) battle field full of (F2Ps) death and dispair (hats).  With all 9 classes (9001 hats) to choose from, the gameplay (hat choice) will most definitely be different from the first time you played (wore a Gibus) as your skill (backpack value) goes up in the ranks of battle (unusuals) in this Free to Play (Free2Troll) funfest (Gabefest).  I give it a dan outa dan."
lost my money forgot to pay bills forgot taxes exist lost my house my credit card locked had to type this review with starbucks' wifi  gg 1/2 game would play again
It's alright.
* Puts new taunts in the Mann Co. Store * * Box taunt for Spy * * Spies can use box taunt while capturing the Intelligence * * Can also push the cart while the box taunt is enabled *  10/10 Would cap the Intel in a box.
TF2 is where I can throw a jar of ♥♥♥♥ at someone and not get arrested for it. 10/10
(Insert your hat joke about TF2 here)
A 'must have' for every Steamuser!
"Ah TF2... 'You were good son real good, maybe even the best.' This was my thoughts exactly before Meet Your Match Update became live. I have pumped so, so many hours into this game and as of late, I've been turned off from TF2 and I really am worried with the way things are right now and seem to be headed. I was honestly looking forward to this update when I first heard about it, and when it came out I immedietely tried out the new casual mode and when I finally got into a server after waiting about 30 minutes (because quickplay got removed) I was greeted with a 6v12 round and got my ♥♥♥ handed to me and had to disconnect after finishing. Since then casual mode has improved, yes, but it could have simply been an added on instead of replacing pubs because in all honesty as I see it, casual is simply competitive easy mode where as pubs were all about having fun with very little consequences where it didn't really matter if you won or lost. I really don't understand why Valve decided to get rid of pubs. Who knows, maybe it was an idea made by the developers that decided that Phlog pyros should become godly before renerfing it to what it is now."
It's an ok game.
"Use to love the hell out of tf2, but now ever since they introduced the Matchmaking system it's either You're getting steam roll'd or the other team is getting steam roll'd games now are near impossible to have fun in do due the lack of a simple team balancing and the fact nobody ever votes for a rematch..   Did you guys even test match making or even listen to your community during the beta?"
"The game totally went downhill after they forced Matchmaking into the game and removed all the official pub servers. I don't mind them adding Matchmaking, but at least make it an option."
a guy with a brony username got vote kicked off the server. 10/10
"Valve are doing anything but what we need and when we need. At the beginning of a quite good class-based shooter, instead of fixing some bugs and making a normal netcode, they turned the game into a hat-selling simulator and were sitting on their ♥♥♥ even for years, getting money for every community item players have created themselves. And now, when alternative games appeared and they began to lose audience, Valve suddenly realised they have to do something what should been done in 2010 - welcome to competetive scene and matchmaking! Only the implementation of all of this is very 'special'. For example, using matchmaking system, players from the United States sometimes are joining on the European servers (with ping ~150). Europeans are in the same boat, because there are perfect Dubai servers where they can play with the same ping.  There still is no classlimit in competetive mode (and I'm not even talking about whitelists), but they already removed some 'unnecessary' settings there - like ability to change player's FOV (are you ♥♥♥♥♥ serious? what moron came up with fixed ~75 fov?); broken configs and the inability to hide weapon models are enjoyable too. Maps are picked randomly, while map pool is extremely doubtful (pl_swiftwater in 6v6? really?). What kind of competetive is this?  It would be much better if they finally fixed some physics problems which are pulled out since GldSource games (like terrible wall collisions) and making a normal lag compensation netcode."
"Turns bad people into trolls, and good people into raging alcoholics. 10/10"
"A long time ago, this was possibly the best game I had ever played. It had a friendly community full of traders, clans, fun servers or competitive games with a sense of humour. The updates were exciting to the whole community, and everyone loved them.  It's not the same anymore. Valve has tried so hard to compete with games that have recently come out over the years, and it's torn apart what made it great.  I'm not saying it's ♥♥♥♥. I'm just saying there was a better time."
"I agree, This is the best Hat simulator ever!"
thanks for not letting me play the maps and/or gamemodes i like and not getting to play at all  at the time of writing i have been sitting in match search for 15 minutes. this ♥♥♥♥ is literally unacceptable
"Killed a Kid with a Frying Pan, Than Shot his friend in the Face 11/10"
"The fall of TF2.  For me personaly started it around 25 Feb 2014, with the inplementation of 'Quickplay' or what other like to call it 'The Death of Community Servers'. I mean don't get me wrong the valve server were great back there. But it was a shame to see all the good Community Servers die, servers where i played like 24/7. But it wasn't the end of the world for me.  Now i just played on valve server only, it wasnt the best, but it was still fun. But then at 16 Oct 2014 something chaged. Valve servers are now using sv_pure 1. 'The death of mods'. That was a huge part of my in my gaming experience. I love to mod my games. And now *poof* gone.  I started to play other games like PayDay2 or DirtyBomb etc. But I always came back for a good old round TF2  Then the 09 Dez 2014 'END OF THE LINE' update hit ['TFGO'] And i hated it. I do not dislike the idea of skins, but i mean we allready got hats for days. Enough is Enough... And don't get me started with this ♥♥♥♥ing ducks. And the ever increasing performance hits made it not better. [I wana play my games over 60 fps ffs]  Around middle of last year i stoped playing tf2, sold all my hats and strages. Played other games and just waited that overwatch would came out.  Now we have the 8 Jul 2016 and i was looking forward to this update. I thought wow some fresh air but god...i was wrong they chaged the qickplay to noplay, everything is now comp.  WERE IS THE CASUAL VIBE....WERE IS ...T F 2...   I LOVED THIS GAME  But the game i loved is a distance memory...  I just wanted to have tf2 back."
"Like Call of Duty: Bad Company 1776, but with hats."
"What goes on in a tf2 developer's mind? hl2.exe not responding?  Community: Add more weapons. The Five Developers: Lets add more useless cosmetic items.  Warning: This includes lambasting and is not for the faint of heart.  Updates They are completely oblivious to the community and keep pushing out horrible major updates to steal your money. It started when they introduced End of the Line. It only added cosmetic ♥♥♥♥ and a duck journal(that you have to pay for). You level it up by collecting ducks. Yep, that is a great update. A year later, Gun Mettle comes out. It introduces collections and skins - totally not from csgo at all. You buy a cruddy pass to earn 2 weapon skins a week. No new items, only reskins. Why update the game for free when you can extort the players even more with operation passes. Skip a year and we get Meet Your Match, an update that removes convenience for a more polished hud. They changed quickplay to casual(like the one in csgo where you get kicked for screwing up). Instead of taking seconds to join a game, now you have to wait longer and you can't join your friends to screw around. However, my main concern is not being able to play some maps due to less popularity. For example, I was waiting for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ matchmaking system to put me in koth_sawmill. It took around 9 minutes to join a game. If you have a mix of very popular maps and less popular, then there is no chance of getting put in the less popular one. The community is getting more toxic and there are more tryhards. Then Halloween 2016 comes and adds some cosmetic stuff and is basically the same update as Halloween 2015. Now we are on the ♥♥♥♥♥how Smissmas 2016. More cosmetics. Why? They lack creativity and resort to leeching off csgo.  Story of the Contract System It was spring cleaning for the csgo dev team at Valve HQ. They had kept the contract system for years and decided to scrap it for ranks. They trashed it and hurled it out the window. At the bottom stood a lone tf2 developer. It smashes into his skull and he was knocked out cold. He wakes up and discovers the contract system. He proclaims,'this must be a sign from heaven!' And scurries off to show his coworkers of his discovery. Two months later Gun Mettle is revealed.  Economy The economy is horrible. Keys are a type of currency used to determine a value of items. When keys were first introduced, they were around 38 weapons(2.11 ref). Now they are 29.22 and going to hit 30 ref. Since you need around 263 weapons just for a key, it will be a lot harder to profit from trading. Don't be fooled about key prices dropping. It happens every year before they(people at backpack.tf) raise it even more.  Collections In tf2, a collection is a group of weapons (or hats) that are weighed by appearance. A weapon skin/hat on the lower tier is crap and the higher( and rarer) one is on top. It is basically a way for Valve to steal your money by intentionally making the higher tier items harder to get and worth more. There is an item called the potassium Bonnett. It is an all-class banana hat. It is all yours if you fork in around 24 dollars. Great deal right? The system is from csgo, another game that Valve bought the rights to. They made sure that minimal effort was spent on it. Industrial(♥♥♥♥) -&gt; Mercenary. Covert -&gt; Elite. If they want to change tf2 into csgo, then atleast change the title to tf:go.  Gameplay Playing the game is kinda fun, but there is a lot of things I dislike. The matches usually go two ways: your teams gets plowed or your team steamrolls the other. Usually when my team is not the best, the enemy team spawncamps with medics ubering near our spawn. The respawn time is around 14-20ish and I don't want to spend 30-40 by dying instantly. However, it is not as bad as the spawncamping/camping on capture the flag maps. If your team isn't good on 2fort, then good luck. You should expect stickies near your spawn doors, enemy engis camping your team's intel room, soldiers with pocket medics roaming the corrodoors, and much more. There is also a feature called autobalance. It makes sure both teams have around the same amount of players. The developers actually improved it. Instead of picking a person who dies first(not top player), it asks you if you want to join the other team. After you accept, you get an experience boost(doesn't do anything). The exp is used to level you up and slightly modifies the badge you get for every level. There is no point of having the badge besides being a ♥♥♥♥ to your friends and showing them your glorious badge before you surpass 150 and return to a level one peasant. There are also a lot of client side and server side problems. A classic is taking cover behind a stationary object and dying due to the server thinking you are not hiding. It is the same with hitboes. Also sometimes when I headshot something, there is visible blood, but no damage dealt. Lastly, the influx of cosmetics is stupid(although I am fine with some cosmetics). Want a glowing cosmetic hat? Prepare to clean your wallet to get an item that shows how much of a moron you are. I realized that too late. The dev team also went to the point of adding effects to tips of muzzles. You have to be a real doofus to waste your money on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ item modification. I installed the game to have fun, not play 'dressup' (Screen Junkies). Furthermore, people have a negative connotation where gibus (new) users are stupid and need to be removed because they don't have a lot of items. People even go as far as votekicking them for trying to enjoy the game. I expect cs;go players to do it, but not tf2.   Competitive Tf2 is a more casual and goofy game. So what is the point of adding a competitive aspect of tf2? The ding-dongs at Valve that it was a great idea to incorporate something that cs:go is famous for. Join the ranks as one of the best players on tf2. Not P2P nor have a usable phone? No worries! Just give us $10. We made sure it is affordable by including a 50% discount forever. The price hasn't changed since release. Atleast cs:go had guns you can buy; tf2 has nothing for competitive. It is just a rehashed version of casual. Instead we get nothing.   Mann Co. Store The Mann Co. Store is a place where you buy stuff from a greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(Saxton Hale). Please don't spend a penny on the store unless you are planning to upgrade to premium. Every item in there is a rip off. A new taunt can cost around 5 dollars(2 keys) and devalue to 2.5 dollars(1 key) within a week. If you want to get an item use scrap.tf,  tf2outpost.com , backpack.tf, or any other tf2 trading site. Sure they have some scammers, but atleast you are getting a better deal than wasting your money on the Mann Co. Store. Another quick alternative is the steam market.   MvM Mann vs. Machine is an alternative gamemode to tf2 tdm. You murder robots and loot their metal corpses. You then spend the money on upgrades to your stats or weapons. It might sound fun, but it hasn't had a single major update since Two Cities, which was three years ago. Want to get loot? Sure, buy a tod ticket(1 dollar). Are you generous and want to help your team? Buy a surplus voucher(1.99 dollars) to grant your teammates an extra weapon! After buying tod tickets, you get to wait anywhere from 2-15 minutes to get matched up. Then buy more tod tickets to complete other maps. Then finish the tour and realized you blew (#) of dollars to get crap worth a couple of cents. Don't want to play for the loot? Try bootcamp! The state-of-the art matchmaking system is sure to match you with a terrible group where losing is inevitable.  Conclusion The game was good once, now it is horrible. I dont know why I keep lingering around tf2. Everyday I launch the game and join a server, it is even more disappointed than the last. I probably won't completely quit until June. Valve breathed life into a game and savagely stabbed it to death. Atleast it will end my gaming addiction."

"You were good son, real good. Maybe even the best."
"You were good son, real good. Maybe even the best."
"This review is very lengthy, as I have a lot to say about this game. So sit tight, you are in for a long ride.  Let's get the verdict out of the way before we get to the real talk: Yes, I recommend this game. I have spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars on it. Is it worth playing? Yes. Is it worth investing your time for a deeper experience? Probably not.   I already predict a lot of hate for this review, but I need to get it off my chest and explain the issues I have with this game. Once again those are my own opinions that a lot of people happen to share. It is completely fine if you want to argue against it, I will just ask you to be honest and less defensive because TF2 is in a critical state.   First of all, I'd like to point out that I've spent 1780 hours, which might be low for some, high for others. I started playing in late 2009-early 2010 and in intervals of several months between late 2010 and early 2012. I enjoyed this game a lot since it was a fresh change from the FPS games I used to play back in the days (CoD 2/4 or CS). It was extremely fun, and trust me, I do not regret a single minute I've spent on this game, before early 2014 at least. I'm not really the Shakespeare of game reviews, and English doesn't happen to be my first language, but I'll do my best to explain my points clearly. I'm going to spend some time explaining each major part the games.  I - Competitive: Why do I want to list this subject first? Simply because this will be a quick talk: Competitive TF2 is basically the best place where you can fully enjoy TF2. The competitive community is mostly made of good and helpful people.   You will play the game the way it should've been played, whether it's a lobby, pug or a UGC match. For my part, I didn't really want to get into UGC because unfortunately I was already getting into CS:GO and couldn't get the time to look for a team but there is no reason you shouldn't.  II - Trading: We had the good part, now the okayish part. Barely spent anytime there. I never got interested in it mainly because I'm not patient, and I can get the thing I need directly without spending 3 years working for a bigger backpack. Most of TF2 is usually into trading, whether they spend 1 hour a month or 23 hours a day in a trading website/server. The trading community is really mixed. It has good people in it, but it also has scammers and idiots. Yet, this is where I've got to meet a lot of good friends, and where I've been amazed by the ego of some. At the current state of the game, according to many professional traders, unless you have some insane item, you won't make any profit. With all the useless hats added, the supply of cosmetics is insanely high, the demand is scattered and the value the currency holds keeps dropping, dragging everything down with it. In short, trade if you want, but watch out for scammers and sharks and stick with the good people. There aren't many, but they are out there. Trading would've been one of the strengths of TF2 if Valve and the heads of some communities didn't ruin it.   III - Community: It's really mixed. You can find good people if you go to the right pubs, as well as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who will instantly kick you if you aren't a 'friendly heavy' or if you ruin their conga or any kind of circlejerk those guys are into. I wasn't lucky with Valve servers as well. Most of the times I played in those servers I was left with autistic meme spouters, 300 ping brazilians or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who will call you a tryhard if you simply try to play the game as intended. Some people also blame bronies or furries for making it worse. I honestly don't care about both, I had to witness a lot of pubs with regulars I've enjoyed playing with dying, and if there is something to blame it is not one of the game's communities such as the ones cited above, but rather the direction the game is currently taking.   IV - Updates: The game is making a terrible turn. It went from a game that could've been a success in eSports to a casual cash-grabber made to attract more people into Steam. They keep on adding useless lore-breaking cosmetics aswell as useless weapons that keep on making the game worse. Many want Valve to add more weapons to the game - I don't. You have to understand that the point of unlocks are, or were to be very situational items and could also act as a costly alternative such as the Gunboats. Some weapons now are either completely useless such as the new grenade launcher or the Back Scatter or completely random such as the Base Jumper or the Tide Turner. Many people are complaining about EoTL for being one of the worst updates possible to the game. It was overhyped by you guys because you couldn't understand that this was the way Valve wants the game to be. Don't blame those who made EoTL, the ones to blame are those in charge of TF2. They had then to throw in a broken ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game mode that seemed to be coded within a day, as well as a couple of useless weapons or taunts to calm the community down after the disaster. The sad part is that it worked. Meanwhile, almost everyone is still waiting on that 'confirmed' matchmaking system which also got 'confirmed' back in 2013. Everyone's hyping it, so please, for the sake of the people who still have faith this game, whoever now's in charge of this game, do NOT ♥♥♥♥ it up.  The game is now 8 years old and still a success for the wrong reasons; but how long is it going to last before more and more people get tired by the way Valve handles the game? Once again, most of these are based on my opinions as well as the opinions of others. I hope this might be useful for some. I had to write it to unleash the anger I had against the incompetent team supposed to replace the original developers. So go ahead, enjoy the game, play it as its fullest. If you've never played this game you are missing something, so do it now while it lasts. Thank you for your time."
"Before you read this and start downvoting it cause its 'TF2' please actually read my review. I have over 5,500 hours in the game and have a lot of Competitive experience into TF2 being 1st Place Steel S.18 and moving to High Silver now. Feel free to add me if you have any questions!  Now on with the review... there is a TL;DR in the bottom.  Team Fortress 2 Pubs reminds me of Mario Party, you can have SOME skill into it but in the end its just RNG and what other people are doing that really lessens the skill factor.  Team Fortress 2 is absolutely no doubt the most addicting first person shooter I have ever played hands down! The game has variety of full teamwork ability and strongly encouraged.  I played Team Fortress 2 back in the end of 2010 and to the beginning of 2011. I even played TF2 on my Xbox at 2009 and on Xbox I was ranked 60 worldwide for a while. TF2 now a days... is just not the same as it is. The MAJOR problem in Team Fortress 2 is Pubs. The games main focus is pubs for new players and pubs are just... awful. If you're new however you wont notice this as much. Its basically a Deathmatch of all classes and the worst part is there really isnt any variety in classes. Everyone in TF2 mains either Scout, Soldier, or Sniper (mostly sniper).   The TF2 Gameplay Mechanics"
Miss shot = you're a noob Body shot = you're a noob Head shot = you're a hacker TF2 Sniping in a nutshell.
" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6LlRjblCuI  tf2 is not dead (yet)  Edit:  So I said that MyM wasn't that bad after all, but only with all the fixes that came afterwards. When MyM just shipped it was horrible and mm and casual were unplayabale. But the system works very well now and I start to prefer it over the old one.  Tf2 is a really old game and it shouldn't have this many bugs in it, but valve just flooded the game with cosmetics and doesn't put much effort into anything else. I'm not saying the game is bad, they recently fixed a lot of bugs and when you play casual games it's still full of f2ps (which is a good sign). But right now the playerbase is decreasing. It's really sad considering how much effort this amazing community has put into this game (probably still more than the current dev team lmao). Tf2 is an old game, but that doesn't mean it has to die. This game could really shine again if valve would get their ♥♥♥♥ together.  tl;dr game is playable right now and fun imo but devs are lazy"
"I had to change this review, because times have changed. A lot. This doesn't mean the game is awful and should be kept away from. The core gameplay has stayed the same and great, but there are other reasons why I wouldn't recommend getting into it big-time.  First of all, no - I do not dislike this game.  This game is supposed to earn its longevity through updates, yet these are becoming more and more rare, and getting an actually good update is like getting a full mark on an exam. What used to happen was: Valve released updates regularly. These updates contained new weapons, maps, balance changes and game modes - exactly what the game needed. But now, every new update is a cash-grab where you pay 5 Euros to have a woman tell you to  play the game  and for playing the game for about 20 minutes you get either a lame  skin  to a weapon, or a crate you have to pay extra 2 Euros to open and get another skin.  This practice is somewhat new, yet people have been complaining about the updates for a long time. Let's take a look at the 3 most recent actually BIG updates, containing stuff which made the game a bit different and new:  The Gun Mettle update 2/07/2015 The Love &amp; War update 18/06/2014 The Two Cities update 21/11/2013  The Gun Mettle update was probably the most controversial of all. It introduced the contracts and weapon skins along with major balance changes.  The Love &amp; War update included some new weapons, taunts and reskins - all-round a good update.  The Two Cities update added a new tour and maps to MvM, along with the killstreak mechanics.  'But I don't even care about the updates!' I hear you cry. The problem is that playing the game is becoming more and more difficult. The optimisation gets worse with every update, the community is becoming increasingly toxic, servers are like the ying-yang and players are either complete noobs who have no idea how the game works, or pubstompers who destroy everyone on a public server.  Again - the game is good, but there are a lot of issues that prevent me from having fun with it. And the worst thing is that I don't think anything can be done by Valve to solve it. It's fine to jump in and play casually once in a while, but becoming a  Team Fortress 2 player  will be difficult and not fun."
I put on a shiny hat and got my ♥♥♥ kicked and people said I'm amazing. I wore no hat and killed everyone and people called me a noob.  10/10 would think TF2 hats translate back to real world money again.
"in its current state, i simply cannot reccomend this game.  current pros: +giant community +for the most part it IS fun +the devs listen to the community +the community can have thier weapons, maps, whatever they make put into the game if valve thinks that it is worth it. (the creators get a share of any profit made) +not your generic 'respawn simulator'. you can get shot in the face by a rocket and still live.  current cons: -matchmaking is the worst its ever been:no more auto balancing means if your team gets steamrolled, it'll be a 3-6 vs 12 or vice versa if your doing the rick rolling. -the casual levels dont really mean anything, as im nearly in tier 2 (blue medals) and im fighting against level 1's.  -only JUST added the kick function -we still see hackers and people spamming 'LMAO BOX' in the chat after all these years.  -some of valves new looks for the weapons are childish and makes the game more silly than anything (looking at you, rocket jumper and sticky jumper) -current bug in the game where if you leave a match, it auto-puts you on the find a match screen. double-clicking the cancel search button results in the game assigning you a match that you cannot enter. -community-run servers are barebones now! there used to be so many community maps like degroot keep and X10 mode. now all we got are some X10 modes and trade servers. awesome -_-  now, as we all know, a youtuber and spy main ambassador known as 'mr.paladin' has left tf2. like, put the game to rest. he has played an AMAZING 6,715 hours on tf2 alone. almost a year of his life on team fortress 2. people are blaming overwatch for this, but i dont see it that way. as he said, the last update was the 'last straw' and 'couldnt re-kindle my interest'. if someone who has had the dedication to play tf2 for so long cannot find the new spark, then how are new players going to put up with the matchmaking, the hackers (every once in a while, valve has done a pretty good job to get rid of as many as possible) etc. right now?   myself? im gonna keep playing. hopefully there will be other updates to return tf2 to what the people want and love. the thoughts of 'its being broken down and re-built' i can get: tf2 wants to still be on the competitve market, to attract new players and keep the games heart beating for years to come. but with this update, i cannot see how this can happen. (the next point im going to make was ramblings i had while waiting for a friend earlier today, so if it doesnt make sense try to get as much as you can)  lets look at some of the big changes in the meet your match update regarding weapons! first up is: the soda popper, the scouts favourite escape tool. just run around and if you get into trouble, just activate the hype and jump away! right? no? oh, now when you take damage you build hype. ok, but if you die, you lose your hype. but in order to build hype, you need to take damage? well, better not equip anything that makes me weaker in any way then.   next up is the sydney sleeper, my favourite weapon as a sniper. now, you can be even more of a ♥♥♥♥ with it as it applies jarate in a radius like the wrap assassins ball and can extinguish teammates with it. yay!   3rd up:huo long heater. this weapon is supposed to be anti-spy but it never works. add a -10% damage and ring of fire damage reduced to 12, unless you have a pyro on your team your boned.  enforcer for the spy! finally, this gun as an awesome use, not just as a last means of escape. now does true damage, ignoring things like battalions backup and vaccinator.   medics now all-medigun movement speed buff. its kinda meh, as it makes the quick fix slightly less usefull but makes the others a little more viable.   double for demo: boots now need a shield to activate speed bonus (before it was an alright trade off, missing a weapon in trade for more HP and movement speed) and the new quickiebomb launcher. this weapon was meant to be for people who dont lay sticky straps and use it as a main weapon. now, you have less in the clip but faster load up time, faster fuse time, more damage on max load and no longer dissapears after 4 seconds. more like spammybomb launcher am i right? guy? no? ok.  engie! with the GIANT decrease in tele cost (from 125 metal down to just 50) its easier to set up, and widowmakers bonus damage to same-target as turret is awesome,but.. well.. it doesnt feel like it needed it. the widowmakers strong AF before if you can a good meatshot, but now it feels like overkill.   this update has had highs and lows, almost as if valve didnt know what they were doing. we have only JUST got the option to choose maps back-before it was a gamble. we all thought that tf2 was gonna pull a MVM on us and just add it as a new gamemode- if we knew what was gonna happen back then, we could have, no would have spoke up and helped the valve community make any difficult decisions. really, this review is a plead to valve, to contact the community and let us have our say about what should come back! auto balancing, revised matchmaking, discussions with the community about future updates! the heavy VS pyro poll was a genius way to see what we wanted, so please more such as this to see what the community wants and needs!   anyone who has read this, i thank you for your time. im not hanging up my hats just yet, but... who knows. maybe this old dog just cant keep up with the young pups today."
"This is the best f2p game, what ive seen. "
"- Played it with hats, cosmetic, and killstreak weapon. Did really good, dominating half of the ennemy team, everyone called me skilled and tried to join my team.  - Played it on a secondary account, without any items, did the same thing, got kicked for hacking in less than 2 minute.   10/10 would do it again"
"I feel as if I should re-write me review for this game, as when I did several years ago I was young and it never really achieved much.  Now as someone who has spent almost 3000 hours of playing this game, I can easily recommend it to anyone who is fresh to steam, or first person games in general. This game provides a helpful tutorial to anyone who isn't ignorant (which I assume the readers are not as they are reading this review, doing research and are eager to learn), teaching basic concepts and how to play more of the unique classes such as the spy and engineer. There is even a training mode to play against AI if you feel that playing against real people is too challenging to begin with. Team Fortress 2 is definitely a game you should get if you are new to steam or PC gaming in general.  TF2 is very different, very diverse compared to other FPS titles. You play as one of nine classes, all with varying roles and weaponry, all with their own strengths and weaknesses. With easily over 100 different weapons in the game, there are many different things to try out. This list keeps growing with the variety of maps and gamemodes to choose from, such as Capture the Flag (a staple in many FPS games), Payload, Mann vs Machine and PASS time. The game also gets somewhat frequent updates, both community made and official, always adding new content and therefore more fun, all without paying a cent.  Microtransactions exist in this game, however not in a pay-to-win function. They solely exist as a cosmetic function, allowing players to add hats, beards, almost any sort of visual appearance to the mercenaries they play as. Now, as this is only decorational, free-to-play players (or F2Ps for short) don't miss out on anything if they choose to not buy these things, however the option is there if they want to spend money on something they enjoy.  The community is definitely one of the biggest things in this game, having kept it alive for 9 years as of later this year. There will be good encounters and bad encounters like everything, however, finding your place will ensure you a great time. Unfortunately, many of the pay-to play players (P2Ps for short) frown upon F2Ps, judging them as 'unskilled and foolish' among other things of the sorts, however there are also many people who are willing to help out newcomers assuming the newby is willing to listen.  Without going into too much more detail, this game should definitely be on everyone's to-play list if they haven't done so already, although just prepare yourself for a very unique experience and many great times ahead.  update so that it counts for that new steam awards thing"
"I actually like this game alot.  Most people think of TF2 as a shooter game where all the players eventually get sucked into the world of hats and unusuals and strange weapons.  That is very true. I've been addicted to collecting them since I started. Still don't have an unusual, but I just got my first professional killstreak weapon and I'm going to use only it for the rest of my life. :D"
"Why did they have to ruin the casual mode? This new UI makes it so I can't even join a game! There was absolutly nothing wrong with the previous version. I just want to click 'play' and 'join a sever', simple!"
"This game has stolen 1/3rd of a year of my life and turned me into a bitter, soulless husk of a man.   highly recommended."
"Probably the worst FPS of all time, where your chance of winning is decided by the amount of headwear one can use. And as the heavy's head is the biggest, he is obviously the most op class. Scout is a manifestation of post-marxism homosexual propaganda masked with a Boston accent to calm the Italians. Soldier does not only suffer from heavy mental retardation he is also a extremely nationalistic American, basically male Sarah Palin. The Demoman is a anti-stereotypical to the point that it becomes offensive, trying to detract from his african american origin as much as possible. The pyro is the gimp from Pulp fiction with a flamethrower, not only is that copyright infringement but also damaging the image of latex fetishists all around the world. The sniper is the most incorrect character since 1. He is not a kangaroo and 2. He isn't upside down. The Medic is a nazi. The heavy is a false display of an incredibly overweight Putin with an insuffurable amount of brain cells. The spy is a meek attempt at poking at the french which fails by him not actually being offensive at all. 10/10 best game ever."
the economy is more stable than most real life countries...
"I'm new to 'gaming,' and TF2 is a fantastic venue for me to learn hand/eye coordination, coordination with team members, FPS tactics, and I can choose a different class depending on what I want to improve. Plus, it's hilarious, I've met some great people, and does NOT take itself too seriously. Thank you, Valve, for keeping this around for new players!"
Newest Update Killed quick Play and Possibly Killed TF2
"Alright, little boys and girls of Steam. Gather 'round the campfire and let 'ol PSi tell you a story.    It all began back in 2011, when I was but a young lad. One day, I heard multiple people discussing the game Team Fortress 2. At the time, what I heard was beyond belief. A game where I could ruthlessly murder the friends I didn't have WITH the friends I didn't have? Sign me up!   Now at the time, my pockets were filled with nothing but air , lint, and broken dreams, so I was delighted to hear that this experience was being offered to me for the low, low price of absolutely nothing. Once the lengthy download was complete, I wasted no time learning the ins and outs of the game. I practiced for quite some time against bots, and once I felt I was ready to get murdered in style , I ventured out into servers filled with actual people, all of them hellbent on killing each other. My response? I simply picked up a sniper rifle, flashed a murderous grin, and uttered beneath my breath 'Let's. Freakin'. Go.' I then proceeded to get shot in the face 50 times before registering my first kill.  Over the next 3 years, I was whisked away on a thrill ride that featured pyromania, robots, weapon nerfs, comics, bakery goods, and of course, hats. By this time I've spent well over 400 hours of my 'life' playing the game and making my teammates angry by failing to snipe stationary Heavies. 3 long years without a single regret.  What's that? You kids wanna experience what 'ol PSi's been through? Well I'm not stopping ya. Just head down to the Steam store, search for Team Fortress 2, and give it a download. You've got nothing to lose but countless hours of your precious little lives."
"Team Fortress 2 is a great game for a wide variety of gamers: it has a diversity of fun and original characters, each with their own playstyle, and even within each class you can attune the items in your loadout to your preferences. The game combines competitiveness with silliness in a very balanced way; the characters insult their opponents upon killing them in such a facetious and amusing way they can barely even be considered offensive, and yet they can drive your mind nuts about that one scout that is just too fast for you, that spy that keeps sneaking past your offensive front or that soldier that lands on your head outta freakin' nowhere! What tops this all off, is the Domination/Revenge system which induces a sharp focus on killing tough opponents, granting great satisfaction whenever you get your revenge, or better, when you get to dominate that pesky little pain in the behind that keeps bugging you throughout the round!  Pros: - Completely free to play; you can make it as expensive as you want, though - Original, witty and funny characters with GREAT voice acting - Silly, yet competitive in a very balanced way - Wide variety of playstyles to suit everyone's preferences - A LOT of different weapons, WHY CANT I HOLD ALL THESE WEAPONS - Weapon qualities that give specific properties (Strange weapons that count kills, strange parts that count other achievements with a weapon, killstreak kits with an increased showoff-level etc) keep the game interesting and always give you a target to play for - Great graphics and animations! Simplicity suits this game perfectly - HATS! HATS EVERYWHERE! - IT HAS THE CONGA. I LOVE THE CONGA! need I say more?  Cons - too damn addicting! - votekick system bugs, which allows trolls and cheaters to throw off an entire game (luckily only happens seldomly)  Overall rating: Solid 10/10 would hat again  So if you're bored and looking for something cheap and fun to play: don't look any further - Try TF2! It's free, so you have nothing to lose (except for your free time once you start :D)"
"It could use a tiny bit more love from the devs but overall it's a fantastic game, the classes are balanced, but if you are going to play you should definitley play a tutorial, TF2 has something for everyone, that's what's so great. You want to be a medic? You got it. You wanna' be a sniper? You got it. Wanna' be sneaky? You got it. Wanna' blow up stuff up? You got it. Wanna' be a walking talking mini gun? You got it. Wanna' be a Texan sentry gun? You got it. Wanna' shoot flames so much that the enemies hate you? You got it. Wanna' run around super fast and be a pest to the enemy? You sure as hell got it. Thousands of community maps, lots of maps, lots of different game mode with tonnes of mods to play on! A (mostly) helpful community who will love having you around? You get it, most of the time.   Honestly, give it a shot, it has its flaws, but what doesn't? Overall, you won't be disappointed."
My money... :'(
"Easily, and I mean this, easily, the best comedic FPS there is on steam. You can play from a hyped Scout kid that seems like he's on coke, a dumb in the head soldier, a crazed Pyro who thinks burning people is like spitting rainbows at fairies, a drunken demoman, an adorable yet horrifying heavy, a chill engineer who drinks on the job, a crazy headed medic who does live surgery, a professional sniper, and a classy spy who gets the job done. Point is, this game is very well developed and has had a lot of effort put into it. Though there are only 9 characters, there are hundreds of weapons that you can use too. Once you get further into the game its more addiction and entertaining, in the start it may seem boring but you just have to get a bit further into the game. You may be thinking 'How do you get far into a game without a Story..!?' well, I meant once you get more items and learn about the game. You can play many different game modes, lots of community made game modes on the community servers, and trade servers. Theres payload race, control points, Intel missions, prop hunt, death run, and many more missions. All this for a free to play game?! GET IT "
Excellent Game pre MYM New tf2 update patch notes: - Removed ability to choose what maps or game mode you play - Added penalty for leaving casual pub games - Queue times are ridiculously long  My opinion is to wait until they fix this ♥♥♥♥  EDIT: Seem to be unable to change viewmodel fov in advanced options.
"10/10, ruined my life"
"Great game great people , future is bright for this old game . No other game is as satisfying to play compared to tf2 . A small but Tight knitted community who have different skill levels but have the same passion for the game keeps this game running till today . Many people have left but new people will come. Do give this old horse a try ."
"Updating back my review on this game for 2 reasons. After so many years this game is still going somewhat strong. For a game this old to have a fairly strong number of players and getting updates means something. The current state of the game may not be as what it used to be before, but the actual gameplay and content still brings some fun moments and experiences. All from a free game.      The other reason is to get that badge and some extra exp."
I can see why people like it.
"Game is fun and easy going. Lots of playable characters to choose from and they are all different in abilities. I like to play as support class and I am very happy that three support class characters are so different and so I can do different things while still playing support! There are so many different maps to choose from to play in that I am sure everyone would like at last one they enjoy. Lots and lots of fun and really good game that I can't believe is free. I have had to pay for games that were not as good as Team Fortress 2!  I was not sure if I would give thumbs up or not because while the game is really good, I don't think player base is good. Maybe I have had bad luck but I have run in to very rude people that did not make the game feel like fun. This game is very fun when playing with friends but going to random server always ended to me with being thrown rude comments at. Comments about me being bad at game I could take because I have played so little that I can not compare to veterans but I think that does not need foul language or people calling me with rude names and going to personal stuff. I had to see others be treated rude too and rudest comments were always given to people who play offense.  I recommend the game but I do not recommend the community."

Smh Overwatch Copy
"To start off, this is my favourite game of all time, but it's less enjoyable after this update and this is why:  They pretty much removed the best part of TF2, the stock Valve servers. Now it's *impossible* to find a decent server that is actually vanilla TF2.  The casual matchmaking is just stupid, I have to wait at least 15 minutes and when I do find a game, I have to hope it doesn't put me in a Hong Kong or American server, where I get really high ping. I can also only have 5 friends in my lobby? I HAVE MORE FRIENDS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥IT  The game is still fun and all, but it's way more frustrating, you can hardly tell competitive and casual mode apart.  At the end of the day it's a decent game, though it can be great again with valve servers...just listen to the community, damn it."
"How to play Team Fortress 2: Be polite, Be﻿ efficient, Have a pan to kill everyone you meet."
This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing mess.  10/10
"Look, the game is ok and fun to play, but with new update 8.7.2016. the game if ****ed, i mean, i cant choose my best map, i need to wait 10 min to find game, and then play with all team gibuses and on my worst map. You also cant use your HUD.  Only thing i like about this new update is the lvl thing... that's it... Go and buy Overwatch, its much better game. Valve, you destroyed Team Fortress 2! I am done playing Team Fortress 2... more like Team Fortress: Global Offense"
tf2 FTW!
"1. Squeaked on the mic. 2. Got better? Started encouraging team play. 3. Befriended a Russian. He is no longer rabid, and waits for treats when he gets an airshot. 4. Got an airshot. 5. Did a lot of sniping. Legitimate sniping. 6. Acquired Loose Cannon. Life complete. 7. Mained Demoman. 8. Started using the mic. 9. Played around in pubs and met nice people. 10. Retreated to honing my skills on bots on Upward for about 500 hours. 11. Returned to the pub scene with the excuse 'I'll never get better.' 12. Started a competitive team. 13. Made some of the best friends I'll ever have. 14. Obtained a pet noob. He knows that we play Mannpower only at my whim. 15. Get this game no matter what your tastes are. I'm a sandbox kinda guy and it still feels great, 1000 hours later. Oh, and: it isn't free."
"one of few games that has stood the test of time and been tended well by devlopers. maybe if everyone just abandonded this we'd get HL3 already though. I suppose Valves thinking on it is 'well we have one successfull game still, why bother making another. We use to make games, now we just make money'"
There are two things you need to know about Team Fortress Dos  1.) No hats = no skill  2.) DONT KILL THE FRIENDLY SANDVICH HOOVY!!!!!!!!!!!  10/10 great platforming
" Jesus, did you see what Volvo just did to us man??"
"Let's start.  Team Fortress 2 it's a FPS (First Person Shooter) game made by Valve and published in 2007, after the beta. The game has nine classes:  ATTACK CLASSES:  °Scout  °Soldier  °Pyro  DEFENSE CLASSES:  °Demoman  °Heavy  °Engineer  SUPPORT CLASSES.  °Medic  °Sniper  °Spy  Each class has his advantages and disadvantages. For example a Spy can kill easily a Heavy, but at the same time he can be get killed by a Pyro. Or a Scout can kill without problem a Sniper or an Engineer, but at the same time he can be killed by Demomen or Soldiers.  This system of advantages and disadvantages makes the game very funny.  The game has also a drop system, which allows to find randomly new weapons and, if lucky, new hats. Infact the game has a lot of weapons, which can be unlocked with achievements (Example: The Force-A-Nature) or can be picked randomly during a game. Each weapons has his own advantages and disadvantages, making the game balanced. For example the Phlogistinator, a Pyro weapon, can gain easily crits but it can't use the compressor (which is essential for airblasting projectiles).   The game has also a lot of hats, which makes Team Fortress 2 a original FPS. The player can use the hats for customizing his own character. Hats can be purchased by the Mann. Co Store or being traded for refined metal (Which is the 'money' of the game).   The game has also a trading system, which allows players to trade weapons and hats, keeping the 'TF2 economy' alive.  Now let's see what it is inside the game!  Team Fortress 2 has a lot of gamemodes, for example Attack/Defense or Capture the Flag.  In Attack/Defense the BLU must cap every RED's point. The BLU will win if they will cap every point before the time expires, otherwise the RED will win.  The TF2 community is always active, expecially on trading, but I don't refuse to say that in the community there are some disrispectful and discriminating people, often following the ideology 'You have no hats? You're a noob!'. Beside this the community is quite friendly.  Now my personal opinion:  I play this game since 23 May 2014 and it never tired me. I enjoy playing this game because it's wonderful how you can meet new friends and working with them for win the match. Every character has his own stereotype, and this make me laugh (in positive sense, of course).   I think Team Fortress 2 was born as team-working FPS and not 'I'm the most pro player in the game!11'. And that is just wonderful.  I say thanks to Valve and thanks to Gaben for making this fantastic game, which is my favorite.  Thanks a lot.  FINAL VOTE:  Gameplay: 10/10  Sounds and music: 9/10  Graphic: 9/10 (It's quite old but I like that style)  (Sorry for my bad English, but I'm from Italy!)    "
"This is the single most entertaining online FPS on the market right now.  Team Fortress 2 is a free-to-play online class-based first person shooter which pits two teams of nine classes against each other in various game modes and challenges. Players can unlock weapons and cosmetic items by completing achievements or winning them through death (though this is random and has a limit which is reset each week). While some bonus weapons are borderline direct upgrades, the unfortunate Scout is still extremely powerful with his stock weaponry, for example. These extra weapons are more comparable to VARIATIONS than upgrades - most of them are designed as side-grades. The only example I can think that is really overpowered is the Medic's Übersaw, but why the hell would you get close to a Medic anyway? His normal Bonesaw can tear you to shreds just as easily, if not  EASIER . My point is that unlike other free-to-play games, you can have plenty of variety and do just as well as a similarly-skilled player with your normal or bonus weapons.  Let's talk about the classes: there are 9 in total, with at least 3 weapons each. They are divided by 3 groups, the Offense, the Defense and the Support. But these groups are useless labels. I'll play by Valve's rules, though. Let's see... On the Offense, we have the Scout: the fast-as-crap, annoying ♥♥♥♥wad who can kill you easily while up close. He can also double-jump! Meanwhile, he's borderline useless at long range. Next up, the Soldier: he has a rocket launcher. The rockets' damage degrade over distance, so long-range spamming isn't a huge deal. He is slow as ♥♥♥♥ on his own, but since he can rocket jump, he is literally one of the most mobile classes in the game. Lastly, the Pyro: he burns you. A lot. He also can extinguish friendlies on fire with his flamethrower's compression blast, which is ALSO USEFUL TO REFLECT ENEMY PROJECTILES (not including bullets, of course). This is a huge feature that makes the Pyro really stand out. Educate yourself on the Pyro and he's far more useful than just his job of burning enemy spies.  Let's check out the Defense. First off, we have the Demoman. As his name suggests, he is a demolitions man, and he can blow ♥♥♥♥ up easily. He has a grenade launcher and a stickybomb launcher, and the latter needs to have it's projectiles blown up on-demand. He can have 8 sticky grenades (or 'stickies') active at once. This class is really good at defending an area and blowing up buildings by the Engineer. Before the hardhat, we have the big tub of russian meat called the Heavy: he has a minigun which WILL tear you a new one up close. Boasting the largest default health pool in the game, he is a force to be reckoned with. However, by himself, just like anyone else, he is pretty useless. So don't get too confident. Now we have the Engineer, one of the most unique classes in this game. Aside from his Shotgun + Pistol, he has a Wrench and 2 PDAs for construction and destruction, respectively. He can build a Sentry Gun, a Dispenser and a Teleport Entrance/Exit. They all can be upgraded up to Level 3, which improves their peformance.  Finally we have the Support classes. This is probably the least misleading label, because they ARE support classes, therefore, YOU DON'T NEED A MILLION OF THEM AT ONCE. Let's start with my favourite class, the Medic: Hohoho boy, seen as a pansy man of medicine, he has a syringe gun which can really hurt a careless someone and a bonesaw which REALLY hurts too. His greatest power however is the Medigun; with it, the Medic can heal a person up to 150% of their health, and once his Ubercharge meter is filled, he can turn himself and his healing target invincible for 8 seconds. He can also heal two targets quickly while deploying his Ubercharge to have them both invincible aswell, but the duration of the Uber will be decreased to 5 seconds. If you're even FASTER, you can have 3 people on godmode too!! But it'll be over so soon that it's not worth it. Now we have the Sniper: as his name suggests, he has a Sniper Rifle, the only stock weapon in the game that can Headshot people. I don't have much to say about this one. Just have good judgment, PLEASE. This class is nearly useless in some situations - if the situation demands it, swap. There are just too many sniper teams that lose so easily to teams with varied classes. Another overused class is the Spy, also a very unique character: He can cloak, aswell as backstab people with his knife for a guaranteed instant kill, given they aren't Ubercharged by the default Medigun. He also has a Sapper, which disables Engineer buildings and after a while they blow up. When used correctly and sparsely, he is an EXTREMELY dangerous fellow. Again, solo judgment please: if you already have more than two of these in your team (in normal 12x12 games), don't switch to a Spy.  That takes care of the classes. What about the maps?! Oh good lord, there are so many official and custom maps that it'd be impossible to describe them all. There are quite a few official modes aswell: Control Points (CP), Payload (PL), King of the Hill (KOTH), Capture the Flag (CTF), Special Delivery (SD), Payload Race (PLR) and Mann vs Machine (MVM)  In CP, it depends. There are Attack/Defense maps, which has BLU attacking the RED control points, and there are 5CP maps, in which both teams need to be in control of all of the control points to win. In Payload, the BLU team needs to push a railed cart into the RED base to win. Of course, RED needs to stop them. In King of the Hill, you have a central point which needs to be captured by one team and held for 3 total minutes. It's pretty much the same as KOTH in other games. In Capture the Flag, the team needs to go get the enemy's briefcase and bring it to their briefcase's spawn point. It's the same as every other CTF game, but the flags are briefcases and their returns are timed - you can't grab your own briefcase to return it. Special Delivery is a 1-point CTF mode, where one team needs to go get the briefcase somewhere in the central edges of the map and bring it to the opposite central edge. Like in normal CTF, the return is timed, and only one team can have control of the briefcase at a time. Payload Race is an absurd one. Both teams need to push their own cart while stopping the enemy from pushing THEIR cart. It gets pretty crazy and it's quite fun. In Mann VS Machine, you have one team against an army of ROBOTS based on the classes (and a Tank). They come in waves and it's the only mode where you can upgrade your weapons and have a special canteen to hold bonuses.  There are custom game modes aswell, such as WarioWare Minigames, Surf, 1v1 MGE Training, Team Deathmatch, vs Saxton Hale (A Juggernaut/'1 versus Everyone else' mode) etc. Once you've gotten pretty good at the game, you can try out competitive TF2, where you'll learn a much higher degree of teamwork, coordination and combat in comparison to normal public servers!  And the weapons? Good lord, there are so many that I'd lose count. Let's leave them as a surprise, yes?  My only nitpick with this game is it's... optimization. It's not that well optimized. At all, actually. This is due to the over-abundance of updates since the last 4 years, but luckily, you can get custom configuration files to fix this problem somewhat. I've also heard if your game gets cluttered with custom content, you can reinstall it for a fresh new start and have the game running amazingly, but I have never tried it.  Sounds like fun? I'm sure it does, and it gets better when you start playing. So, what are you waiting for?! Some final words? A numerical value?? SEVERAL ONES, MAYBE?? Fine, but I'll get you just one! Here's your damn score:  TF2 gets a score of 9/10. It's extremely fun and it never gets old. It IS counter-intuitive at first, but when you get used to it, it's awesome!"
"Such a wonderful game. Such a fantastic community. Every month I get added by several phishers. AFTER THEIR SUPPOSED DOWNFALL. Get scammed by my best steam friends, then he blocks me. Being called a noob after dominating a pyro.... being a pyro. being called 'queer' when joining medieval rpg servers. phlog gets raised. degreaser gets ♥♥♥♥ed. Engineer and Demo fall economy is worse than Latvia's. GG Valve, ♥♥♥♥ing add the R8 Revolver to this ♥♥♥♥ now maybe? "
"okay, i have been sitting here for 10 minutes!!! waiting for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ server to connect!!! Valve FIX THIS CRAP!"
Awesome game. Get your hat and get playing.
"Mindenkinek ajánlom! Nagyon jó játék!  I recommend it for all fps gamers, its a really good game!"
"Absolutely awesome game! A great range of classes to choose from. Scout is a fast running class that is mostely used for doing the map objective (capture the flag, pushing cart) and just generally annoying people. Soldier is a slow moving class armed with a rocket launcer, a shotgun, and a entrenching tool (shovel) soldier is one of the main damage dealers in team fortress 2. The Pyro is a masked psycho armed with a flame thrower, a shotgun, and a fire axe. Pyro is again a main damage dealer but instead he/she uses his/hers flame thrower to burn enemies alive. The Demolitions Man (demo man) is much like the soldier with explosive weapons instead a grenade launcher, a sticky bomb launcher (manually exploded bombs that stick to walls etc) and a bottle! The demoman is a main damage dealer aswell but used as a defence class because of his sticky bomb launcher to make traps he is also very drunk! xD. The Heavy weapons guy is as you guess, a guy with big ♥♥♥ weapons! he carries a minigun, a shotgun and uses his fists to punch people! Heavy is the God of damage dealing, he can kill all the other classes quite easily, but be careful! Heavy is a very slow class and is quite vulnerable to take damage from behind! The engineer. The engineer is a defence class that creates Sentry guns to defend, he can upgrade his sentry 3 times. level 1 being a normal sentry, level 2 being two chainguns on the side and level 3 with a rocket launcher on the top! The medic is the support class healing his teammates who are in need of help, the medic is the second fastest class in team fortress 2 he also has a thing called Uber charge, which is you and the person you're healing have a few seconds of invulnerability. The sniper is a long ranged Damage dealer he uses a powerful Sniper rifle, a SMG and a machete the sniper can take out most classes in a quickshot however you can keep scoped in to fill a meter which makes your shots more powerful, when this meter is full you can take out a heavy in one shot in the head! The spy is a very different class... The silent assassin, the spy carries a revolver, a knife and a electro-sapper the electro-sapper is used for destroying enemy engineer's sentry guns although the engineer can destroy these sappers that doesn't mean that you can't backstab him! an important role in the spy is to backstab people with your knife to instantly kill your target the spy has the ability to make himself temporarily invisible and has the ability to disguise as the enemy team to fool them! That is all the classes in team fotress 2! I hope this review was helpful and i hope to see you on a server! Good bye -Jarhead"
"Ever since the last Halloween event the game is becoming less and less enjoyable. The worst part was the Meet Your Match update. You can no longer just join steam friends, unless asking them and waiting for them to finish game. Matches last like 5-10 minutes and your team either gets destroyed or you are destroying the other team. Very rarely there's a balanced match. Whoever enjoys competitive gameplay will enjoy this, but whoever just wants to spend like 30 minutes of spare time, it wouldn't be such a good experience.  Valve became too lazy to update anything, or should I say the number of people working on anything related to the game (bug fixes, updates...) decreased dramatically. That definitely decreased the quality of the updates. They're even too lazy to modify the last major update we had on the store page (which stays Tough Break now, released almost a year ago). Events like Scream Fortress were really enjoyable in past years, because Valve always added something new. For the past 2 years they rely only on the community to create a few maps and that's everything new about the event.  For the time being I cannot recommend this game to newcomers."
Not enough hats.
No lie my friends kept talking and talking and talking an talking etc. about this game and i thought they were crazy. when i started to try the game i think i understand how addicting it is

Fantastic game definetely reccomend
"A great FPS Game with a lot of fun! - This game stole my soul.  Pros: +Hats. +More Hats. +Hats takes over control of this game. +Various custom gamemodes: Deathrun, VSH, slender and more. +Upcoming competitive games. +Mann vs Machines -COOP. +Great servers. +Crazy and good Community. +Humor, a lot of humor. +And.. hats..   Cons: -Gaben tries to destroy this game. -Some of updates are ♥♥♥♥♥♥. -Weapon nerfs. -And yes, kids..   TF2 will never be boring for me. 8.5/10"
This game is amazing and takes almost all of my spare time these days.  It's one of the few games that fascinates me and keeps me interested in it. Also the gamemodes made by different people are amazing.  also unique and gimicky weapons and cool and silly hat makes this game more appealing.

"This game is amazing. We have to start with the classes. You can be Scout, and be obnoxiously quick and capture quickly. You can be Soldier, and be slow but damaging on the battlefield. You can be Pyro, and clear out control pointss in seconds. You can be Demo, and guard hallways with sticky bombs, You can be Heavy, and be a crazy russian attacker, You can be Engineer, and put sentry nests straight outside the opposite teams spawn, You can be Medic, and extremely help your team out, You can be Sniper, and get a lot of headshots, And you can be Spy, and you can buttstab people :D  The commmunity is also great. Sometimes you may come across one or two idiots but thats any game, really. The price for items is also alright. Although not great, if some hats are worth more that ain't that problem. And the servers are fun and hack-proof (usually) Unless you play on Aimbot servers, in which GTFO.  Overall i think you shouold download this game right now and step into the shoes of Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demo, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy!!!!!"

"This game ruined my social life, wallet and basicly everything else. ♥♥♥♥.  10/10"
"What happened. No seriously, what happened to this game. I feel it all started going downhill after the introducton of promotional and cosmetic items that didn't fit the style. Now it's a wasteland of community models with precisely zero quality control, extremely awful optimization, a billion weapon reskins, the scamm-co store, traders, and an utterly broken menu system. Valve's quickplay devastated custom map servers by not listing them, something that caused many to shut down completely and disband a lot of great communities. The End of the Line update was an inarguable disaster that even the most hardcore valve fanboy couldn't defend with broken promises and no actual content. And finally there's the trainwreck known as meet your match. The only reason I still play is because I have an old bunch of friends I can go back to. To anyone who actually reads this past the idiotic and useless 'POOTIS' comments on the front page just know what this game has become, it's been a long time since 2007."
"Team Fortress 2 is a cartoony MMOFPS with a super-dose of character, and more pop references than you can handle in one sitting. Players play one of 9 mercenary classes working for one of two corporations (RED and BLU) duking it out tooth-and-nails over a variety of objectives ranging from briefcases, to giant bombs in mine carts. With a tons of weapons, achievements, hats and maps, this game has incredible longevity, and will keep you latched to your screen hoping for that one achievement, or that specific weapon(Golden Pan for me) you’re looking to get.  Classes:  Spy(My Fav): Proficient knife fighter and mother lover, the spy can feign death/cloak and disguise himself into the enemy team.  Demoman: Trap-setting, one-eyed Scottish demoman with a knack for blowing things to pieces. Is surprisingly good with a claymore.  Engineer: Texan cowboy with a knack for turret building. Incredibly efficient at point defense, you’ll grow to love or hate his turrets.  Heavy: Chain gun wielding boxer, the medic’s best friend. With a massive health pool, this is both the damage soaking, and damage dealing class.  Medic: Mad doctor wielding a surgery saw to battle. Specializes in deploying ubercharges on teammates, making them invincible for a short time.  Pyro: Axe-wielding pyromaniac specialized in ambushes, and generally setting living things on fire.  Scout: Super-fast class that uses its speed to outmatch opponents and quickly capture points.  Sniper: Long-range shooter with a knack for throwing jars of suspicious yellow liquids.  Soldier: Frontline tough guy with a rocket launcher, and a lot of punch."
"I joined a payload server, and stepped out of spawn, playing as medic. Two scouts lept over the nearby hill and starting beating me with fish, and I ran up to the nearest teammate I could find, and the scouts left.  Two minutes later, I have full Ubercharge, find the same teammate, kritz him, and he's a spy and he shoots me in the face, then dances on my corpse.  Then he got blown up by a random crit sticky.  10/10 would spend too much of my ♥♥♥♥ing money on hats again"
"I heard so many reviews a time ago about TF2, in fact, since then and I'm looking forward to trying this game someday. And now I'm really surprised. Absolutely perfect and very enjoyable game.  10/10"

"Valve, no more free tickets on christmas please"
"Meet your match, This review change is long overdue, but here it is. This update DESTROYED MOST OF THE GAME. Pubs were easy to access, and fun to play on, but what's that? Valve have become the ♥♥♥♥ing fun police and removed those and added 'Casual and competitive servers'? You've gotta be jokin' mate. Casual started out with HORRIBLY LONG WAITING TIMES, I haven't touched competitive because it's not really my cup of tea. BUT Casual is a MESS! Hackers, Lack of map decision.  But at the start of casual, the part that made it a trainwreck? Leaving penalties. IT'S A DAMN GAME OF CASUAL! And they removed autobalance, woohoo right? 6v12 is fun especially when it becomes that when 6 of your salty teammates leave because they lost, boo ♥♥♥♥in' hoo. Now, the Hackers, my least favourite thing to deal with. The most infamous are either Dab squad or VAC Police, Both game ruiners, They're not in competitive, but c'mon. Comp's usuallt filled with edgy salty tryhards, not great individuals to deal with. But the biggest minus about removing quickplay, IS THAT IT KILLED A GOD DAMN SERVER. 'but roo what suver did voov kell?' you may be asking, TF2APP, They're shutting down soon, or hell, already shut down.  Valve are gonna do that 'We're sorry, we'll patch it soon.' ♥♥♥♥, like they always do. Heavy VS Pyro was a thing that after like a week, nobody gave a ♥♥♥♥ about.  Pyro won, (go figure, valve hate russians and love aliens apparently.) And He'll probably be given another buff, and an ungodly weapon which does insane damage, Phlog 2.0 Basically.  Give the development to somebody who gives a ♥♥♥♥, Like the community.  They're making tons of cool, creative things and like what, 10% of it actually gets in?  The community clearly know better, and actually give a ♥♥♥♥ about the life of the game and not how much revenue it makes. Frankly Valve, you need to get up off your arses and make some Actual ♥♥♥♥in' content.  Do your devs even play the damn game? Because it clearly looks like they don't.  The review's staying positive because i've been spending time on community servers, but still. God damn."

"This freaking update ruined the ♥♥♥♥ing matchmaking, I have to wait like at least 20 minutes to play a single game, not to mention that after the match is over, you have to get out and wait another 20 mins. Oh, I forgot, you are also forced to choose 2 gamemodes minimum and forced to play like casual games were competitive.  10/10 Would wait again"
"Casual mode: Searching... searching... *ten minutes pass* searching..  Meanwhile im searching for a new game to play, will be much quicker than finding a casual match.  #Bringbackpubs"
"Meet your match was a joke. Comp♥♥♥♥ sould have just stayed playing UGC and ESEA rather than taking a ♥♥♥♥ on the main game. Casual mode is a disaster, nobody knows how to play the game or even to have fun. All my favorite servers and community servers are either dead, or are struggling to stay online because nobody plays community servers anymore and not too many of those that do are willing to help keep them online. GG Valve. The only reason I still play this is the small hope that my favorite servers eventually getting more than two people on at a time... And even that doesn't look promising anymore."
Latest update is an exercise in frustration. Not playing until it's fixed.
hats are love hats are life 10/10
"As someone who's been playing TF2 for 4 1/2 years, I can say that this game, at one point, was a good game, that the developers cared about. I've noticed that for a LONG while, the developers of this game, just simply stopped caring as much. I mean, don't get me wrong, they still released occasional updates, bug fixes when they were needed, but as soon as competetive was announced for TF2, that's when it all started going downhill.  It all started with the gun mettle update, when everyone realized that the developers of TF2 had stopped thinking, when they copied the concept of weapon skins from CS:GO without even attempting to hide it. I'm not saying that it was a bad thing entirely, as weapon skins introduced a new form of trading into TF2, an entirely new market that players who weren't interested in cosmetics could get into, as they affected your point of view in game, and were still as valued as said cosmetics. A lot of things were added in the gun mettle update, that quite litteraly nobody asked for. For example, community maps that nobody liked even before they were added into the game, adding text to certain weapons 'i.e. flare gun' where they added text to it, that said '100% crit chance on burning targets', something of which litteraly everybody knew, and nobody asked for. Not saying it was a bad addition, of course, just an unnecesary one.  Anyway, moving on from gun mettle, the next major update that hit, the Tough Break update, an amazing update, where the absolute genuis' at Valve headquarters looked at the most complained-about weapon in the game (Phlogistinator), and decided to buff it. Why? Eh, why not? Team Fortress 2, everyone knew was gonna die one day, why not kill it a bit faster? They decided to take a weapon that was already considered by many 'Overpowered', and make it much more OP. Few MONTHS later, they decided to nerf the phlog, which everyone was happy about, but they nerfed it in such a way, that questions whether or not they actually put thought into it, who knows, maybe they just nerfed it so that players who quit would come back, and spend more money on weapon skins and cosmetics. Why am I using this as a point? Because, it's evidence that valve barely listened to their community, and quite frankly, doesn't give a goats ♥♥♥ what happens to it, as long as they can still milk money off of weapon crates, they're all happy.   Anyway, done with that absolute mess of an update, now let's move on to a somehow BIGGER mess of an update, one that actually brought this game down from 'Overwhelmingly positive' to 'Very positive'. In case you haven't noticed, this game's current review ratings of this month are 'Mostly positive' at 76% positive. While in most cases, this wouldn't be such a bad thing, this game was at 90% monthly ratings just prior to this update, meaning that it's safe to assume that 14% of the average reviewers were also heavily displeased with this update, to where it actually made the game worse in quality. This update forces all 'casual' players to play like it's 'competitive'. Why? Because, Valve just wants to do the right things, but in such, SUCH terrible ways. Yes, they've brought in an official competitive update with this, something the fans have been asking for such a long time, which some players were happy about, but now, they're forcing everyone who plays their game to play it 'Competitively', and not casualy, because calling something 'Casual' and treating it like competitive doesn't make it casual, now does it?   One last thing I should mention: The TF2 economy. Yes, this game has an economy, one that, at one point, was litteraly more stable than some third world countries, but there were certain sites that specialized in dealing items, and other sites that gave the items a price, some of which standing at $4,000. Yes, really, thousands of dollars on a virtual hat, which is just evidence that TF2 has an economy of its own, however, Valve, having made it, seemed not to have cared about it. Reintroducing harder-to-get items, sometimes of absurd prices into newer, WAY more common crates for.... Well, because it's to appeal to newer players, I guess? A perfect example of this would be the Strange Kritzkrieg, an item only obtainable through either trade, or opening a crate that costs about $20 USD, it may have risen since then, I'm not sure, but anyway, Valve thought it would've been absolutely genius to bring this item into a new crate. No, not a rare crate, those don't exist anymore, a crate that you can find from breathing air. What did this do to the item? It drastically brought it's price down, simply because Valve doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ what happens to this economy, as long as there's more of an item being bought, they're happy, since they get tax money off of community market transactions.  Anyway, to wrap things up, TF2 was a game with such good potential, going on for 9 years without dying, but unfortunately, unless Valve ACTUALLY brings in a good update, that isn't just milking the game out of as much money as possible, this game will most certainly die soon. Until then, I'll keep this negative review up, until something's done about this negligence, ignorance, and overall just confusion on decisions."
" Once upon a time,"
Went from fun and enjoyable to a 'total head♥♥♥♥' in just 1 update ~~
"o yeah! If you knew how much I hate this game! Spent about 5000 hours of my life, and all for what? Let's see) ╾╾╾╾-√V╾√V╾√\╾^√╾╾╾╾╼╼ -√V╾√V╾√\╾^√╾╾╾╾╾╾╼╼╼╼╼╼╼  △A huge plus is that the game is not like the others in its genre, for me it is a game with great potential to create different tricks and tactics of the game. Most likely that is not important enough in the game is the appearance of caps and other items I think the game was given a second life, which she lives and sow the day.  ▽It is not strange but in the game there are also disadvantages, the most important and perhaps the only time that has passed since the inception of the game, namely, today people want to play next-generation games, the game is losing popularity faster and faster, can not withstand competition.  I want to immediately apologize for my English this is not my native language) with respect PINKY|:*"
"Definitely a game you should of have played, since it's Free to Play."
hat
Awesome game! Been playing for like 3 years now. Great trading and competitive community. Took me 50+ hours to get decent enough to like the game. Enjoy it! Best free game by far of all time!
"The new update has ruined the fun feeling the game had before. Also, $10 for cmopetitive?! REALLY?"
Pretty good.
"After the Gun Mettle update came out, I spent £5.35 on a virtual box. Glad to say that's the best £5.35 I've ever spent."
I want to uninstall this game for stealing hours/money of my life but I love it too much to even consider it.
One of the best + funniest multiplayer ever created. WARNING: addictive!
games pretty fuggin awsome yo.
I can't take seriously a game where a Frying Pan is worth more than my House. I can't take seriously a game where your Hat dictates how good you are.  And yet I play this ♥♥♥♥ and have fun.  9/10 needs more weapons.
♥♥♥♥ this game
I heard this game was cool. Probably will check it out sometime eventually.
"~Lost my money to this game ~10/10 has conga, mannrobics and kazotsky kick ~I pray to Gaben every night, hoping to see if he'll release a good Tf2 update, someday... ~Gibus is way too OP. Why don't they nerf it for once? ~It costs $400,000 to feed Gaben for 12 seconds. How do people even obtain the money to feed him to begin with? I have no idea, but I hope Gaben is happy being fed all the time. ~Spycrabs are so powerful that it makes the enemy team spare them, sometimes. ~Genuine Spycrabs are indestructible. If you try to kill one, karma will strike back! ~Sandvich eating hoovies because they make the best picnics. They have a very warm, welcoming environment who'll dance and be friendly to anyone if they do the same back. ~Phlog still has yet to be removed from the game.  ~Sleep? Who needs sleep when you got Tf2? Cancel all of my jobs because I need my Tf2 ~Merasmus needs to get the bonus ducks back because ducks are everything. ~Hats which makes you 10x better at the game apparently.  Overall: 7/10. It's not even realistic. How do you aim down sights with your pistol or shotgun? Not even soldier's helmet protects you from headshots, and pistols don't instant kill an enemy when aimed at the head. In conclusion, it's an okay game, but needs more realism~IGN"
"Pretty much the best Free To Play game I've played so far. The multiplayer on this game is awesome. It's all team based and fun, no class is more important then any other class. It's not all self based like Call Of Duty, you work with your team to win. Team Fortress 2 also has unique weapons that help you in combat. On the other hand, I HAD to talk about HATS. Some people play just for the hats, I play for usually both of them. If you're looking for a great F2P game, this is the game for you. Hope you have fun!"
"I have playd years of Avp1, avp2 and Counterstrike. before i tryed this out. At first i left the game after about 30h, but when i started playing this again, i noticed how amazing game it is.  The humor in this game is best ive seen in ANY fps multiplayer, and once you have played for a while, you can notice communications while playing whitout anyone even using any words. (people use voice communications/gestures to really complex lengths) (+you can start massive sandvich eating fests whit pootis heavies, and throw freakking ♥♥♥♥ at people before killing and taunting at them xD)  But it isnt just about the humor, when trying to become good in this game, youll notice how there are skills in this game that other games of the same gengre dont have as much. Learning these skills, (rocket jumping, spys mindtricks, building placements etc. is extremely hard but rewarding) Also the character responsibilty in competetive game is quite massive.  And then there is the humongously large itemworld, you can create character sets from so many items, that its extremely rare to find someone whit exact same set.  You can earn items by random drops by just playing, and crafting them to better ones later on. Or you can play MvM tours to get quite rare ones, or open boxes. And the best part is that the items do not give you better stats, instead they give you option to play differently.  Summary: Youll get grazy action like no other, skills hilarious comedy, the community is the best ive seen in a game this popular, and free updates that have been distributed for many years.   Best of all, its Fun to play and competetive at the same time. Cheers GabeN"
"I used to love this game. Valve basically took everything I loved about it, everything i appreciated so much in this game with the most recent Update. If there wont be any changes, my path will never ever cross again with tf2. i invested such a long time in it, i played it for YEARS! you robbed its fun!"
"You know, it's that famous game where people don't team together but it's a 'must teamwork' game. It's that famous game with hats, hats, hats, hats, hats and.... hats. It's that famous game where young kids play and complain because it's not COD. It's that famous game with more minecraft servers than minecraft itself. It's that famous game that teach you how to trade and make profit like a true -censored- It's that famous game where everybody weared a gibusvision set at least once. It's the famous Team Fortress 2  10/10 I'd go back to 2007 to buy an Orange box."
"Radically different from the going FPS standard. A gem gameplay wise. It's free, there's no excuse not to give it a try.  That was the short version. If that didn't convince you yet, move along.  The mechanics the 9 playable classes are based on are remarkably creative and pretty unique: While one class is able to perform a Mario-style doublejump, another can literally blow back enemy missiles at their rightful owners' faces, and then there's a soldier whose playstyle revolves around surfing on exploding rockets' knockback - just to graze a third of the available characters.  The variety in gameplay is still increased by unlockable gear for each of them. And believe me, whether you're going to fight your foes with a pistol or a glass of milk DOES make a difference.  Talking about unlocks, a widespread disease of free to play games with unlockable content are those being 'pay to win' options - not in Team Fortress 2. Owning more items than yor foe will not ensure you an advantage; either all their upsides are balanced by negative side-effects or they are purely cosmetic.  This makes the game very beginner friendly because it prevents new players from being straight-down outgunned (additionally all of the gameplay-relevant stuff is easily obtainable for everyone; you recieve a free item every ~40 minutes of playtime) while it also allows advanced players to customize their characters to both, visually and gameplay-wise, better meet their taste.  Combat itself too breaks away from the norm in many (positive) ways. There's a static health pool instead of the genre-established regenerative system, and although revolving around mid-ranged combat, this game shows a complete lack of assault-rifles of any kind. I guess the most noticable difference to other games of the multiplayer-FPS-genre though is that confrontations between players typically last significantly longer, with fights designed around the recieving party nearly always having a chance to react - which is something I greatly appreciate, for that's what I personally feel titles like Call of Duty are lacking.  There's only few negative things to mention about the gameplay mechanics; minor annoyances such as the 'randomness' damage-modifier and an at times wonky melee hit registration (though, that's a flaw shared by literally every multiplayer game there is) are just that: Minor annoyances. Eventually they don't spoil your overall expirience.  Although 7 years old, the game still is steadily growing and updated regularily, with bug fixes, balance patches, new maps, items and game-modes being released every month or two, ensuring you won't end up bored.   So, to recap: Whether you are casually or competitively motivated, whether you like proving your skill against other players, or prefer fighting alongside them against hordes of robots, whether you like stealth, traps, mobility-based combat, or sniping, whether you want to beat your foes by setting up turrets or slapping them with fish, you _will_ find something to enjoy in this game. And yeah. The only thing it costs you is the time it takes to download.   9.5/10,  would  will play again."
" Let me be honest with you. The way Valve treats this game nowadays is underwhelming.  The developers make changes that make me scratch my head sometimes. However, I am still coming back to this game every week for multiple reasons.   The nice community, the casual fun, countless of custom maps and much more.  (Like hats)  Even after 2000 hours I still feel like there is so much more to learn.   Team Fortress 2 is by far my favorite game of all time.  So yeah, for every person who is into class-based shooters I say, why not try it out? It's free. With no pay to win elements."
"Biggest and best MMOFPS since CS 1,6 ;)"
"Probably one of the best games I have ever played. It has a great community (aside from the occasional squeaker), incredible gameplay, beautiful graphics, and a weapon system that is diverse, but rather than one weapon being particularly 'better' than another, they are more adaptibe to different play styles, something that is not very popular in games these days. Although there are players who have been playing exponentially longer than me, I usually feel like I can get a decent number of points without having to intensely practice. Overall, Team Fortress 2 is just an incredible game, and I couldn't reccomend it more."
"I got the game along with “the Orange Box” back in 2007. Of course, Team Fortress Classic was, like Portal, just a side character where the protagonist was really Half-life 2 Episode Two. Before I begin on Team Fortress 2, allow me to spend a paragraph or two on its predecessor. (Skip the next 2 paragraphs if you are not interested)  More than a decade ago, during the era of 56kbps internet and much frustration for both the internet users and phone callers alike, I bought a disc which contains a number of Half-Life mods, including the all-time famous “Counter-Strike 1.5”. I was very fond of this little piece of gem back then, as downloading a 500mb file is near impossible. Little did I know that I will be spending most of my time on something else that I have no idea what it as back then, a mod that goes by the name of “Team Fortress Classic”.  “Team Fortress Classic” has one of the most versatile first-person-shooter gameplay back then when compared to contenders such as “Counter-Strike”. Although the original concept of Team Fortress is based upon the battle between two teams with nine different classes, I am more personally attached to the party-style gameplay which its custom maps have to offer. With over a thousand of maps to choose from, it is possible for me to find myself in the most peculiar yet fascinating maps and situations. I could be playing volleyball or basketball using rockets, or partying in a pub while trying to sneak pass a Heavy-Weapon-Dude-Bouncer; I could be roaming around Osaka or Sahara; I could be defending or capturing a point, massacring or being massacred by a heavy, or even laughing my butt off. Yes, it was fun, and it was hell of an epic party each night.  That was more than a decade ago, and then came “Team Fortress 2”, sitting with its peers in an orange package. The question is not whether the game is good or not, but whether can it continue its predecessor’s legacy. It has been 7 years since its release and time did tell that Team Fortress 2 is more than competent in continuing its predecessor’s legacy, though the effect was not immediate.  As with most online multiplayer server-based First Person Shooters, Team Fortress 2 started off as something that is quite weak and linear. The community for Team Fortress 2 was still building up back then and there isn’t much community-made customizations back then, something that is very important in laying a foundation of a multiplayer game so that its longevity can be sustained. The only major improvements between Team Fortress Classic and Team Fortress 2 is that the later has an improved cartoon-like skin, which is more suiting for its party-like gameplay nature, and an item system which was pretty weak back then. The rest are pretty much the same.  Time pass and the community grew as the old source engine becomes outdated. A larger variety of weapons begin to appear, and the community start coming up with a variety of mods. From Saxton Hale campaigns (boss fights) to Prop Hunts (Hide and Seek), and then to the official Mann VS Machine mods (Coop game-play), the legacy of Team Fortress Classic begins to take form within Team Fortress 2 at a foundation which is even more solid than its predecessor. Team Fortress 2 stood the testament of time and the size of the community surged. This is even truer when the game went free. I’ve had my share of fun, laughter and tears (due to laughter), and I have met my clique of friends where whom I have remained intimate as we journeyed through different games while transcending beyond the boundary of Steam. Team Fortress 2 has came a long way, and, although the results might not be immediate, it sure is worth your investment of time.   Oh and if you are wondering, hats are never my interest."
"This shooting game where cosmetics are more important than weapons introduces the player to a world where two teams of mercenaries fight each other in various modes like King of the Hill, Payload Race and Capture the Flag. There is also the Mann vs Machine mode where a small team fights giant hordes of robots.  Play as the 9 different mercenaries, each with their own abilities and personality quirks. No matter your skill or playing style, there's a class that suits it!  You'll surely enjoy this game that never gets old thanks to the frequent updates that bring new content such as hats, maps, weapons and gamemodes. And the best part is that it's NOT pay to win, since the game is well balanced and you can get weapons for free fairly easily. Your only concern will be getting more cosmetics!  Team Fortress 2 is pure multiplayer fun, and one of the best games I've ever played."
"'We used to make video game, now we destroy them.'  Valve."
"Pros: - Great FPS shooter - Balanced classes - Fun maps - Great game modes - MvM is a fun - Trading is a lot of fun if you can get into it - Fair item drop system - Free to Play - Hats  Cons: - None  Final Verdict: Team Fortress 2 is one of the best games I've played. It's a super fun shooter that never gets old. With multiple game modes like KOTH, Payload, Attack/Defense, CP, and MvM it doesn't really get old. Trading is also quite fun if you can put some money and time into the game. I highly recommend everyone to try out considering it's free anyways.   10/10."
"Deer friends, pepholes end grills on urth. Dis geam is god like. It is basically a mmorpg allaround sonic race game. i bougt dis geam. 3 yeers to the back. 6 Daysl latr, i cry. Its like mixing chocolate and nutella. Chocolate = gud, Nutella= meh wich creates tf2 = cO² Several days. If you talk abot the mexican metalfaper, i rthink about ebola. Australin, German 'non racismt) end Putin are in geam. Thx pece Pls listen 3 Aborted"
I'd say this is the best hat simulator out there
"How to ruin your life:  1) Download Team Fortress 2  2) Learn how to press buttons on your keyboard to play Team Fortress 2 3) Grind for hundreds and thousands of hours for that one thing that looks really cool. 4) Congratulations, you now have no life.  This method is tried-and-true, I have even tested it on myself; that's how sure I was that it would work."
I regret spending money on this game
"Team Fortress 2 is definitely one of the best FPS ever made; This does nothing but confirm the supremacy of Valve Software for this sort. Although many people think that the lack of interactivity and respect of physics in the game can be a big flaw, ultimately would prove to be an important aspect for all gamers who want to have fun without too much energy"
"I bought the game when it was still $20. It was the first game I had ever bought on Steam, and around that time in fall of 2008 there were only three characters updated with achievement weapons. Trading and hats weren't in existence yet, and the game truly was a 'teamwork required' type of game. Every class felt balanced and fair, with each one having their own respective strengths and weaknesses. Even the achievement weapons brought a nice change of pace from the normal minigun and bonesaw. You actually felt accomplished when you did the achievements because you were rewarded. The community was surprisingly welcoming, and a majority of my Steam friends came from TF2. At the time, we had thought that Valve was going to update the rest of the characters with their own achievements and that would be all; and for awhile, we were right. One by one the rest of the classes got their own weapons and achievements, and by July 8th 2010 (Happy Birthday to me!), the Engineer was the last character updated. The game felt complete, three years in the making. Now... I think everyone knows what's coming next. Before I get into detail on the update that changed (or in my opinion, ruined) everything, let me just say that Valve had already put hats into the game months before, way back in August 2009. I was perfectly fine with the hats, they added a sense of personality to your classes and all you had to do in order to get them was play the game (a novel concept, I know). Hats were the only thing given to you as a random drop back then. I should probably point out that I took about a year break away from gaming at this point in time due to 'real life.' While I was away, the Mann-Conomy update happened. This update wasn't like any of the others, this update added tons of brand new weapons and hats, along with the addition of an in-game store and trading system to get them. When I eventually returned to TF2, the game wasn't about the objectives, or teamwork, or even being the best player anymore. All the game was about now was collecting the most hats and weapons you could get your hands on. The achievements didn't matter anymore because you could just buy whatever you wanted, or just find it as a random drop (since they updated it to more than just hats). The game that I fell in love with, spending sleepless nights for years, was all for nothing at the drop of a hat (quite literally). I'm not mad at Valve for what they did, from a business standpoint this is the smartest thing they've ever done. But whenever I see the game in my Steam library, I just get a deep feeling of nostalgia and longing for something that could have been. I hope that one day, I'll be able to relive those fond memories I have with Team Fortress 2."
TERRORISTS WIN
"Team Fortress 2... first started as a team based shooter, now a heaven for hat trades. Even though the game looks nothing like it was more than a decade ago, it still feels similar. The game is good, the game is free, and it's not pay-to-win. It doesn't hurt to try.   "
"Item servers completely destroyed by last update. I can't get out of a team select or select character screen, no matter how many times I try.  Completely broken. 1/10 until fix. That 1 is because the community servers still work."
"'Would you recommend Team Fortress 2?' Oh please, are you breathing? The answer is that obvious! Yes! I love it! Almost every aspect of it is perfect. What more can I ask for?  -  Free To Play  &gt; I don't have to add on, do I? It's wonderful. It creates the rainbows in the skies. It makes my unicorn fly. BAM!  -  Noob-Friendly  &gt; I started out as a gaming noob, barely knowing anything about Steam, or Team Fortress. My friend recommended Team Fortress 2 as my first tryout and I got hooked not long after.  &gt; They have a  training mode  to shape you up in and out, even an option to  request a coach . 100% human plox. They offer amazing  training grounds ,  offline practices ... If you can't get a hang of Team Fortress 2 after playing it for a week, I'm judging you. Jokes! But it's really noob-friendly and I recommend this for first-time FPS players. &gt; 'You'll get tired of your first ever game easily.'? False! I still play Team Fortress 2 and I'm loving it even more than when I just started out!  -  Sweet Graphics &amp; Animation  &gt; Got a thing for  realistic, not-too-gorey, and somewhat-cute  graphics? Yo! This' the thing for you, bro!  &gt; As a first-time FPS player, promoting myself from Maplestory and being a scaredy-girl, I'm scared of extreme gore and blood. Team Fortress 2's graphics are awesome to me as  there's just enough gore and blood , pretty much tolerable, and sometimes even funny! Also, if you're finding a FPS game with 100% no gore and blood... First off, I don't even think there's such a game. Secondly, you're not gonna have as much fun! *sad face* Lastly,  it's an experience!   -  Various Types of Gameplay Plots (Maps)  &gt;  From Payload Races to Capture The Flag, from Control Points to Mann VS Machine, there's probably as many plots as, or more than, the fingers on your hands!  &gt; Every plot has a  different style of playing, strategies and players ! If you're good at finding something, and probably have a good way of running away, Capture The Flag is for you! Hate computers and how smart they are? Or if you just want to rage at multiple objects which are stupider than you, Mann VS Machine is there for you to cast all your sorrows!  &gt; Team Fortress 2 gives us so many choices, it's hard to stick to one. It's like reading a book, you'll get bored if you keep reading the same story over and over again, but you still love the writing style of the writer. Thus, you read the other books by the same writer! Same logic!  -  Various Classes  &gt; As someone who just popped in and promoted from Maplestory, I like the idea of having my  character suited for different situations . For example, although the Heavy is great at clearing maps, it gets annoying when a Sniper from the other team takes advantage of your slow movements and spam kills you. What do you do? Change to a Scout and crash that Sniper's brains! &gt; Different classes are great at different maps, it complements the gameplay to the max!  -  Multiplayer Features  &gt; There's a chat system for you to communicate with your teammates -- by  typing or speaking . &gt; 'But people are so annoying!' No worries, you can vote to  mute, kick, and ban  players on Team Fortress 2! Thank God for this.   -  Character Customization  &gt; The Mann Co. Catalog. Fanciful, huh? &gt; You can get different hats and weapons to customize your characters, and make them  the way you want them to be ! Recommended for hipsters who are trying to escape the mainstream. To be honest, I feel more encouraged after I get a new look... Is it just me?  -  Market  &gt; You can  buy, sell and trade  for hats and weapons to customize your character. It gets irritating when you see someone having this awesome weapon you want, and yet you can't get the drop. There's the market for you -- buy it from the Mann Co. or the Steam Community Market. It isn't very expensive either, considering most of the items are  roughly $0.99 . &gt; When you have no idea where the spend your Steam Wallet and want to train your business skills.  -  Teamwork  &gt; Let's get to the social part, shall we? Team Fortress, like its name,  strengthens players' sense of teamwork . I'm pretty sure your parents or teachers screwed into your brain how important teamwork is, so I wouldn't get on that.  &gt; Example time! You're playing Control Points and there's an Engineer from your opponent's team that has been building sentry guns for forever. He's wiping out anyone who steps near the control point so you can't capture it. What do you do? Conspire with a Spy to sap the Engineer's sentry and have everyone else rush forward to capture the control point! Teamwork at it's best.  -  Community  &gt; The community is  fun to be in , and I'll just say the developer has a  great sense of humour . Just take a look at their YouTube channel! I've never laughed so hard at characters from an online game. If you've ever watched 'Meet The _____', you'll realize that the classes have their own personalities and their own backgrounds! It's very entertaining to watch and laugh at. &gt; Team Fortress 2 has a  wonderful amount of artists , take a look at the fan art! Some are cute, some are gorey... All just plain Amazing with a capital A. &gt; Don't know how to play? Good heavens, there are so many  guides  written by the professional players! &gt; ♥♥♥♥♥  I may have missed out one or two points, but you get my point. Team Fortress 2 is far more than amazing for a Free-To-Play game. So I'll say, '9/10 will get it.'  *gives developer a hug and kiss*"
  About Team Fortress 2
ruined my life
Ruined my life. 10/10.
"Team Fortress 2 is a first-person shooter game from Valve.  The gameplay is somewhat similar to Counter-Strike but with more variety of game modes, class based player, and unlike Counter-Strike, in terms of gameplay this game is more casual rather than competitive, at least for me. Everyone can play it, from kids, teens to parents, everyone can play. The game is very well balanced, each class has more than one unique abilities you can explore. You can get item drops as you play, and the more play, the more you can get. Items can be crafted for another better items too, or trade them for other items. And the best thing about his game is hats! Yes, hats. Most every damn people here on Steam loves them. You can show off your hats, craft it or even sell them! Many people make profit from it, many people collect it.  Team Fortress 2 graphics is 3D but with cartoon style. Even though the graphics is cartoon, Team Fortress 2 still feature blood and gore effects. All effect from explosion, weapons fire, rockets, everything are cartoonized.  This is great free to play game for me, I highly recommend it. Play it now!  Rating 9/10"
"Tf2 used to be fun but now every single update they release is just a poor cashgrab with mediocre balance patching that makes weapons frustrating to use. 'Buy a pass/ticket to play the update and get items, guys!! Buy a battle pass so you get a chance to get a crate you have to pay more money to open!' The game reeks of greedyness and lack of care.  It was fun while it had more than 1/8 of a developer. Please valve, give tf2 the love it deserves"
Hello darkness my old friend You've come to TF2 again Because the casual matchmaking  Left its seeds while we were sleeping And now none of us can get a game It's a pain Welcome to the servers of silence
"i love this game but now that u have to wait really long to join a server and not find servers where the server bar used to be, i thinkill just play other games until u fix this. please fix soon"
"the latest update ruined my day, pls make tf2 playable again"
"This game is like Jumanji. Once play this game, you can be stuck in it for the next 26 years."
Every violent obessive collectors dream. Team Fortress 2 is by far the best point and click adventure game I have ever played.
"The game itself is still fairly solid, but the majority of its playerbase is just so offensively, horribly bad that it makes actually playing it completely and utterly unfun.   Matchmaking was SUPPOSED to fix this, but it lacks any sort of placement matches. This has resulted in me, a player with over 3300 hours who has been playing since the Pyro update in 2008, consistently being matched with squeaker, 3rd-world, 6 year olds with toasters for computers who have been playing for 20 minutes. And there's no way I can escape them. I think, even if there is a future update that fixes this, this here whale is done with TF2 simply because it's just been more frustrating than fun, and it's burnt me out for good.  Unless you are one of said 6 year olds (in which case, go for your life, you cancerous little cyst), I can not recommend this game anyone anymore."
"Team Fortress 2 is Valves hat-sensation team-based fps, featuring great multiplayer and a stylized designed. TF2 boasts a fantastic community and steady economy for trading making it one of the best free-to-play games Steam has to offer."
The new update is terrible I used to be able to join a game in 2 minutes now I have to wait 10-20 because it's 'searching' also now I can't even easily join a game with my friends.
"Bring the old pub system back Valve, please! :c"
I wonder if I will ever find match now
&gt;2016 &gt;Still playing this awesome game &gt;HL-3 confirm?
i spent at least more than $150 on this game. gotta wear them virtual hats
"Ah, TF2, one of the most well-known and popular FPS games out there on Steam, especially since it became Free To Play on the Steam Store. Ever since a friend got me into this game, I've been playing it non-stop for more than 200 play hours in total, and I would like to take the time to give my own thoughts on the game as a whole and some tips for newcomers to help them on their way to enjoy the game and not ragequit within the first 20 minutes of jumping right into it.  First off, gameplay-wise the game is a typical multiplayer-based FPS game where the core goal is very simplistic: Hop on either the red or blue team and kill the opposing team and secure victory, however, the methods of accomplishing this range per match type, and usually good teamwork and class diversity are required to win the match.   As for said class diversity, the game offers you 9 different playable class characters to choose from, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages, and it's a key requirement for any player to learn the limits and strengths of those classes in order to play the class effectively and to be of benefit to your team as a whole. Thankfully the game has a alright tutorial on a few classes, specifically the Demoman, Spy, Engineer and Soldier, but there are many tricks for a class that the game doesn't often directly tell you, but rather clues you in through the in-game loading screen tips section when you go to a match.   Picking a class that suits your playstyle is often the first thing many new players struggle with, but the classes all range from fairly easy to pick up and play decently with, to far more tricky and fragile ones that require the player to be familiar with the mechanics and overall gameplay before they can effectively use them in combat. Such examples are the Heavy, Soldier and Pyro which in my opinion are some of the more easily accessable classes for new players to experiment around with, and Engineer, Sniper and Spy for the more experienced players when they feel confident enough. It has something for every kind of FPS gamer regardless of skill level, which is what I really like about this game.  Atmosphere-wise, the game is very visually pleasing with alot of intricate map design accomodating the various matchtypes, and is designed so that players who are unfamiliar with the map and it's pathways are given visual cues on where to go, like if they're on the red team, a red arrow sign will point in the general direction where they need to head to, as well as various signs detailing a mission's objective and locations, like 'Intelligence' for the intel briefcase on capture the flag, 'Battlements' for the general middle area where most of the combat will take place, etc.   The classes all have dynamic personalities that make them a blast to play as and you'll often chuckle at their lines regarding the situation, which really gives this game alot of personality. I personally really enjoy the Pyro because the character itself wears a gas mask which makes most of his lines almost inaudiable, but if you listen carefully you can make out a few key lines that he screams out.  Besides the game's addictive core gameplay, there's alot of side content to it like customizable loadouts to your class' arsenal, cosmetic clothing and different taunts which you usually have to acquire through specific unlocking methods, crafting from metal which you get from turning additional weapons into metal which you obtain from random weapon drops during gameplay or trading with other players.   Trading is one of the key mechanics of interacting with other players, and interacting with other players is oftentimes a good way of getting to meet a nice friend on Steam wether it's someone on your team, or someone you encounter while on a specific trade server, and who might be able to trade or even gift you some stuff if you're friendly to the player and and he/she is friendly to you in return. Just be careful of annoying or pushy players who are out for your items and will offer either nothing or nearly worthless items in return, though, if you happen to encounter those, just ignore them.  There is also a Mann vs. Machine co-op game mode in where you get to work together with 5 other players being the limit against a horde of powerful robots trying to defend your area from a bomb they will attempt to deliver at all costs. This game mode is much more intense than regular multiplayer TF2 and you can earn nice cosmetic item rewards for your weapons in the Mann Up mode, but the Bootcamp mode is free to play and a good way for practice, but Mann vs. Machine is very tough and is not recommended for newcomers of TF2 to try out immediately.  With that all out of the way, here are a few tips I would recommend everybody who's going to try this game out to follow if they want to have a pleasant experience playing this game in the long run:  - Always stay friendly to other players and don't act obnoxious or self-righteous to others. The name of the game is TEAM Fortress 2, meaning that in order to win, you need to work together as a team, and not go out there, thinking you can take the entire team on yourself, which will oftentimes lead to you getting killed over and over again. Communicate with your fellow team members over the situation and what you're planning to do, or regarding plans or tactics that the enemy team is using through the default Y normal in-game chat and U team members-only chat window buttons. Your team members will appreciate it if you're friendly, and will be much more likely to co-operate alongside with you towards completing the objective if you do so. Sure the game can get very hectic and is easy to get annoyed over a supposed 'cheap kill' from a enemy player, but overall try to maintain a friendly atmosphere in the game.  - If nessecary, do offline training on maps that you're unfamiliar with, and explore the maps so you'll know the shortcuts and side routes into enemy territory. This is a key factor into becoming a more skilled player over time, as there are many side routes that are often easy to miss or not pay attention to that the developers of the maps implemented in order to balance the game and make it possible for a team to overcome the other if they're being pressured or having difficulty breaking through chokepoints. If the enemy team is spawncamping, try to take a different spawn exit and flank them from behind. If the main route into their base is heavily guarded, look for a alternate pathway to take and inform your teammates about it.   - Play classes that suit the current situation. This is a common mistake that I see occuring alot on many servers I play on, as quite alot of players seem to not grasp the limits of a class and oftentimes like to stick to one class only just because they like playing as that certain class and refuse to play anything else that the team might benefit more at that specific point during the match. Players need to observe the situation and pick classes whose advantages are required at the time. To give a good example, payload is a match type in where the red team needs to defend the bomb from being delivered by the blue team, and as such will be spawn-camping right off the bat during the start of the match. Yet alot of times there tend to be about 2 or 3 Spy and/or Sniper players in a team of roughly 9 to 12 players on blue. Those 2 classes can only take out 1 enemy at a time normally, and will be killed easily. You'll need a strong offensive class like Heavy or Soldier to pressure and kill the enemy team, and if your team doesn't have a Medic, be one. Medic isn't a easy class, but your team members will benefit from the healing so they won't have to retreat to the supply closet often. Class diversity and good communication about class choices mid-game can go a long way in winning the match.  Thanks for reading this, and hope it was insightful. I definetely recommend this game!"
Like the 'meet the' videos more than the game itself.

i love this game :)
Team Fortress 2 is free to play as well as free to uninstall
"A lot of the fun that I used to have with TF2 was casually joining a friend's game in a pub, be on their side, or comically kill them with a crocket on their opposite team like a prank. No I don't hate the game, I still find it enjoyable. But I'd rather do other stuff than level up a badge and be in a queue for ages nonstop. Things got too tryhard-y, I wonder if there's other games for that laid back feel of the sillyness that I used to love of TF2."

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO TF2 IN THE UPDATE REMOVE IT ITS CRAP JESSUS CANT EVEN USE LOADOUTS
Sometimes I dream about playing Team Fortress 2. Then I wake up and play Team Fortress 2.  It's pretty good.
Love it.
please help me i've lost my life over this game
"  tl;dr  Quirky shooter that shows its age but is still charming and tons of fun, though recent updates are lacklustre.   Consider the following: If a game still has a large and active fanbase after nine years, it must be doing something right. That's what Team Fortress 2 is doing; it's been out for a staggering nine years, and there are still many loyal fans. What is it doing that lets it live for this long?  Before we talk about that however, let's talk about TF2's gameplay. Compared to other shooters, it's quite bizarre--no sprinting, no aiming down sights (there is scoping for sniper rifles), no accuracy bonus for crouching, and no accuracy penalties for running or jumping. It's a jarring transition if you're used to COD or CS:GO, or vice-versa--like me, but it creates an incredibly fast-paced game where it's more about dodging and being unpredictable than accuracy. There are 9 classes: The Scout, offering the fastest base movement speed and a double jump; the Soldier, an incredibly versatile unit who can trade health for speed with rocket jumping; the Pyro, a 'utility assault' who can disrupt enemies with fire and keep teammates safe by extinguishing fires and reflecting projectiles; the Demoman, a versatile unit with the highest sheer damage output in the game; the Heavy, a tank who can shred enemies at close range in a mere second; the Engineer, a utility class who can rush allies to the front lines with teleporters and lock down entire areas with sentry guns; the Medic, the most important class with the power to break stalls with Ubercharge; the Sniper, the most powerful pick class who can take the sting out of enemy pushes by eliminating key targets; and the Spy, who can disguise and cloak to get around enemies and backstab them for a one-hit kill. Every class is unique, with their own upsides and downsides; compared to Overwatch however, it's not as much of a game of rock-paper-scissors. While some classes counter others--Engineers and their buildings are vulnerable to Spies, while a puff of flame can nullify a Spy's stealth devices--some things are not set in stone. If you want to ♥♥♥♥ off the enemy team, you can just run half-Pyro, half-Engineer, and nothing short of the enemy team using nothing but Medics and assault to nuke your fortifications can stop it. All in all though, it's a lot of fun.  Now, how has TF2 stayed so fresh after nine years? Updates. The game has received a whopping 575 patches since its launch; 37 of those were major content updates that added new items and maps to the game. All these updates mean that there's always new things to play, and new ways to play. It's customary for me to check in on TF2 when a new major update hits. However, as of late, TF2's updates have been taking a rather bizarre turn, and sadly for the worse. Sure, adding weapon skins was cool--I think they're awesome, and the stock weapons looked boring to me anyway--but it's been a year and a half since any weapons were added that actually had unique stats. It's an incredibly sore spot for TF2 fans that it's been this long since a new weapon was added to shake things up; while the TF team has promised that new weapons are to come for the Pyro after the Pyro vs Heavy War, that means we have to wait even more--not helped by an overall lack of transparency meaning we have no idea when this update will actually come. This new direction TF2 is heading, combined with the TF team often being eerily silent when it comes to fan outcry, causes unnecessary paranoia and negativity, which can be resolved quite easily.  Of course, being a nine-year-old game based on the dated Source engine, TF2 is also full of bugs. Some are good, some are bad, and some are just plain awful. It's as if with every map launched, tons of 'leaving-the-map exploits' are found and for a short while you get killed by sentries you can't see or attack. The TF team fixes these...reasonably fast...but sometimes it takes months for something to happen. If you're looking for a bug-free experience, it's definitely not here.  All in all, Team Fortress 2 will leave behind quite the legacy when it finally falls, but I hope it still has a good few years left in it--at least enough for a Team Fortress 3 to arrive. Whether it'll last long enough will depend on how well the TF team can work with their dedicated player base, and sadly, it can't be hidden that so far it's looking bad. Regardless, if you're looking to try a different FPS experience and want to have some casual fun, TF2 is a great choice."
you can put 2 sandviches toghther and make scrap metal    10/10 100/100 best game
all i care about is the competetive 6s community to grow up ... this game is amazing and hopefully valve will plays its card right. no comp player played this game for money... we play it ( im not a comp player ) because we love the game not because of the money if one valve tf team can see this then you know what to do.   You made one of the greatest game of all time don't ♥♥♥♥ it up.
"Valve ruined one of the best,if not the best class-based FPS with a poorly executed,overhyped,unpolished update.For years,Team Fortress 2 has survived many disgraceful updates that gave the community the feeling that VALVE wants to transform TF2 from a very exciting and thrilling FPS with a diverse cast of playstyles and characters into a platform for selling crates,cosmetics and skins.    *CASUAL*  This update killed QUICKPLAY and the actual casual mode,and replaced it with a ranked semi-competitive mode for tryhards to sweat thier b*lls at.The current state of casual is better now after VALVE realised that players want the freedom of choosing the map they want to play and the gamemode they want to enjoy.In its first version the new 'CASUAL' mode punished players for leaving a CASUAL match which doesn't make any sense since CASUAL ,by nature is something you want to enjoy without any punishment.Now that this horrible feature has been swept under the rug,the actual 'CASUAL' is better now.The long queing times were another reason that made this gamemode a steaming pile of poo,beacuse they made the game quiet impossible to play. On release I experienced a 30 minute search time,after sitting my ♥♥♥ reading the patch notes for those 30 minutes,facepalming all the way, I got into the game and I got to play 5 minutes until the match ended.This kind of nonsense made alot of the players to quit the game.Now the que times have been improved to ~5-10 minutes,but its still ludicrous considering the fact that before MYM you could easily get into a game on a map that you enjoy,playing the gamemode you love in less than a minute.So if I would make the statements above shorter in patch-note format it would look like this:'-Amplified the queing time beacuse using the QUICKPLAY interface was too confusing for new players'.The long queue times on their own makes the CASUAL mode not worth the time,but the rest of the issues that i mentioned are just the icing on the cake   *COMPETITIVE*  The cover star for the update,the competitive is an overhyped feature that TF2 needed since launch.The actual system is basic with nothing deep to it.TF2center's competitive setup is deeper and the guys that are working on that site actually give a damn about competitive.This new mode its just a dumbed down 6s game that you might have experienced if you used TF2center.There are no whitelists of class and weapon bans in this set up so you can rock 4 heavies 2 meds easily and crush the opponent.Your average competitive experience can be summed up in the following matter.You join,if you are on the point of losing a match,a player in your team will disconnect and you can all leave in peace without any punishment,however if you win, most of the time you will steam-roll the other team because they may lack the communication or synergy requiered to win a match.The intense matches are rare and they can be great fun on both sides .Overall the matchmaking system implemented represented a small portion of what the community really wanted and a huge number of head-scratching choices made by the dev team    *WEAPON BALANCING*  Valve empolyees don't play the game.Short and simple.They break the balance constantly and they p*ss many community members off by nerfing good weapons that the community enjoys.A good example is the Phlog,Loch n' Load disaster that made the community ask VALVE's sanity when they decided to buff them.Speaking about the current balancing:they buffed some underused weapons that nobody will use ever,they created the scout pocket meta by buffing the medic's speed while healing the scout(You should read the weapon balances if you want a good laugh).In my honest opinion VALVE should communicate with us and let us know what they are up to so we can give some constructive criticism.   For me TF2 was the best fun you can have online.It had and it still has a very addicting gameplay with a unique artstyle,character roster and unique weapond designs.Unfortunately now its a cosmetic selling platform that is dying update by update.   Rest in peace TF2, one day I would love to see you young again....."

If you like TF2 then you will LOVE TF2
"Hi Tom, I just wanted to let you know that you left your sprinklers on earlier today. I came over and turned them off for you so you can save water.  Take Care. Ruby."
"I don't really feel it is necessary to talk about what's good about TF2 on a wide basis, because we all know what is good about it. It's updated from time to time, it doesn't feel abandoned like most multiplayers and it has a large pool of creative fans. Plus custom game mods like Slender Fortress, Freak Fortress and Death Run make the game twice as better. So I'll just point out the negatives.   Explosive spam.  It is understood in a 30 player server that spam is existant and will forever stay that way. Kudos  Short Circuit.  It was fun while it lasted.   Crutch weapons/shields and overall annoyance.  Black Box/Concheror. Darwin's Shield. Reserve Shooter. Beggar's Bazooka. Vaccinator pairs. Degreaser combos. Despite naming these, I bet all of us use them anyway. So I guess you should all feel horrible about yourselves.   Mini-sentries.  It sets up in less than 3 seconds. The engineer has the ability to pick up his gear; why not force him to ulitize a push with his teammates instead? It's a server killer. When you're on a team that doesn't feel like destroying them constantly, it's dead.   Melee system.  You may run into some issues with hit registration not going your way, like hearing your melee weapon make it's hit sound, but no actual registration.    Pocket medics.  This can go both ways and it's understandable to heal just that one power class that's getting most of the dirty work done. We get it. But what you don't get is that you're gaining much assistance as well from the rest of your teammates that is providing much said and needed push. Do the team a favour. Heal everyone (at least those who respect you).    People not understanding the difference between Boot Camp and Mann Up mode. The essence of Mann Up mode is to use the most effective loadouts, have a organized team of each class and to get through wave by wave. If you want to mess around, there is Boot Camp.   Lag compensation.  This takes the cake. Shots will seem off and you'll most definitely have those moments where you either got sniped through a wall or railed through the wall by the Heavy's curving mini-gun bullets. You thought you got past that wall, but you didn't on their screen. Seeing as I play Scout, it's something I notice on a daily basis, specifically against heavies. It's just all lag compensation. Curious to know more about it, I recommend googling it.   Critical hits.  It's either you get lucky or outlucked. If it's a issue for players, you'll have to search for those servers that host non-crit settings as the known popular public servers don't. There can be humor in it, but not when it's so frequent. Either way, critical hits are random pokes of not fun and it ruin the results of good matches.   Servers not tolerating class balance.  Not everyone wants to play in a server infested with engineers and mini-sentries/sentries all over the place. Or more than 2-3 demomen spamming stickies everywhere. Whatever the scenario is, this slides right into lack of teamwork and coordination. Things may never get done the right way, so your best bet is to probably just find another server.   Try to get a fair team scramble going and all of the average to good players may quickly go to spectator mode to restack again. We are no angels to that. Who doesn't want to be on the better team?   Closing comments...  Although all of that is what's to dislike about TF2, you'll somehow just find a way to see pass through it all and enjoy the game for what it is. Make some friends, find a favorite server and avoid the awful memes if you can."
still a better game than dota
Someone who jacks off to a cartoon horse told me to kill myself for playing the game 10/10
It's hard to play a game when you have to wait an hour to connect to a server. Also TF2's greatest appeal is the casual and fun atmosphere it creates. The latest update tries to take all of that away. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ updates make for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games. One week ago I loved this game but I would definitely not recommend this in its current state.
Best game ever played.
"Once upon a time, in a server far away There was a blue Scout that shouted 'Bonk!' when he hurt people. This Scout was facing a dilemma. The Scout shouted, “I need a dispensah over ‘ere!” However, the Engineer was facing problems of his own. “A Spy is sappin’ my sentry!” The Engineer shouted back. The Scout could see no red spy. Unfortunately, this lead to his downfall as the Scout was then backstabbed by the Spy. Before the Scout completely died, the Spy whispered into his ear, “I did your mother.” As the Spy walked out of the room, he disguised himself as the recently fallen Scout. Until he got hit by the Sniper's Jarate. This drew the attention of a red Soldier 'I think his mate saw me.' The Sniper whispered to himself. A rocket to the face only proved that fact."
A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.
"Check Metacritic Kiddos  Team Fortress 2: 92 Overwatch: 91  Team fortress 2 &gt; Overwatch  Pros:  -Valve game -Free -destroy 12 yr olds -F2Ps can still beat P2Ps -Hats -putting $1 on your account allows you to make so much more -Nine extremely unique classes -MvM gives escape from PvP -Hats and Cosmetics -community servers and gamemodes adds spice to your life ;) - and of course, Hats  Cons: -Occasional Hacker or general toxic players (general online game problems) -There's probably some other Cons, but this game is to enjoyable to notice them  Overall, the character's personalities was probably the thing that I enjoyed the most, but there is so much more to enjoy in this game. But, seriously, if you haven't played this game, you proably don't have Steam."
"It's time I wrote a honest review for Team Fortress 2. This is just my opinion based on my experiance with Team Fortress 2 and why after 1,290 hours I quit, so please don't hate on it because it's different from your own opinion. This is going to be somewhat long of a review, so don't be suprised that you'll have to read multiple paragraphs.   When I first came to TF2, I had so much fun with the game. I couldn't believe a game so old looks as if it barely aged a day. The gameplay is absolutely amazing, everything handles smoothly, and no weopon or class being greater than another. Although some weopons and classes can be annoying to deal with, they are not truly overpowered, you just need to find a strategy to deal with the weopon or class (also a tip: stock weopons are the best stat wise, but there are very few exceptions). I could have any loadout of weopons of my choosing then just play a match. Under the otherwise salty and rude players, I found some of the most honest and kind people I've ever met. Ziggy, Jake, Chuckles, Ash, Alex, Fatalia, Cider, Speg, Bruce, and the list goes on and on. These are some people I don't know how I would live without them, I honestly do not deserve their kindness. I mentioned a lot of people because it's true, you will meet so many new people, actual kind and caring people.   But, there is a reason I do not recommend this game. I finally got my first australium weopon and my first unusual, I spent so much money to get them, which is not even including the countless hats, stranges, killstreak weopons, taunts, ect I had already bought. I looked at my australium and unusual on my Medic for which I mained at the time and thought 'Eh, doesn't look good enough' and planned to buy better unusuals and better australiums and then go for collectors items. It took me a while to realize it, but it simply won't stop. Hats and australiums and all the countless variations of weopons do not make you a better player, they are not necissary for you to play the game. You will never have the best hat or best looking weopon. I wouldn't stop buying these useless cosmetics to further boost my ego. To realize just how much of a narcissist I became to have the most beautiful inventory and glammorize myself. It's an addiction that won't stop. You will look at your hats and realize that you don't have enough. How long will it take for you to hit that peak of items? How long will it take to realize all you bought were just useless textures, particles, and movements? For which, what will happen when you reach that peak of weopons and realize all the time and money you wasted? It took me so long to realize I spent too much money. I sold everything to end the addiction, that's why my inventory is just a wasteland of a former player.   If you plan to play TF2 for trading and profit, I don't recommend that either. The game is slowly dying and so is the economy. The next few updates will foreshadow the fate of TF2. If this further shows TF2's future death, the economy will go down with it. Meaning money invested in trading will just be lost. This game has just been milked to death in the last couple updates to keep it's playerbase and gain more money. TF2 is still one of the most played games on steam, but I can't say TF2 will hold that spot in the next few years. TF2 has greatly changed in the last few updates. Leading to matches and matchmaking feeling like a chore rather than the fun experience it was meant to be. TF2 has grown stale to me. These updates from all the way from End of The Line to Meet Your Match have further induced this staleness I feel and why so many players have left. No update has hyped me since Invasion. I don't find TF2 fun anymore, the magic is gone.   If you still are content with playing TF2, please, please do not spend your money. Just play for what's left of the silly gameplay and just have fun. Just play to meet new people hopefully people who mean just as much to you as the people I met mean to me. Please just don't get over hyped or spend money. Just enjoy the friends you'll meet and what's left of this game. Good bye old friend."
"Currently the game is AWFUL. It lost everything that used to make it any level of good and has now been replaced with things that make it total garbage and not worth playing, at all.  Quickplay is gone. It's been replaced with some god-awful replacement called Casual. It's boring and doesn't have the feeling of randomness and surprise that the old pubs used to have. Dosn't help that the Queue times are god awful as well. I managed to watch 3 entire 'SGBPlay Mario Party' videos, which are about 1:30 hours long each, before entering a single match of Badwater that lasted about 10 minutes. And in those 10 minutes, it wasn't fun because instead of having the old people on pubs like the mic spammers who would be entertaining if they did things like put music or do impressions of Morgan Freeman, or the team Hoovy/SpyCrab who you could walk up to, have a sandvich with and maybe even conga for a few minutes, now you get a team of tryharding idiots who can't take a joke for the life of them. Hell, even the LENNY/BIND spammers are gone. This simple move has taken all the character and charm TF2 had and ♥♥♥♥ all over it. Next is the balancing. This game has HORRIBLE balancing. Especially since VALVe doesn't communicate with the community to tell them what was coming up, or take jokes people say too seriously or what they seem to enjoy doing. Only listening to the competitive players. People like B4nny and Mr.Slin, while awesome people, were the only ones who have their opinions heard by VALVe, and to what has that opinion led? Phlog Buff of Smissmass 2015 and Caber Nerf of Summer 2015. Two weapons that were perfectly fine, especially the caber which was basically a suicide weapon and after the initial explosion did a fragment of the bottles damage, and the Phlog became the 'Walk and Die' weapon of the century. This update has brought unwanted/unneeded changes. Come on, who was complaining about the Buffalo Steak Sandvich!? WHO COMPLAINED ENOUGH TO SAY IT NEEDED A NERF!?  Next is the communication. VALVe communicating with the community, WHAT A PIPEDREAM. They never tell us what's coming up for incoming updates. At most we get the ocassional 'Neato' in the sub-reddit. And why you might ask? Because the TF team is 5 people who don't care/give a ♥♥♥♥ about their own game. Overwatch was released, one would expect VALVe to raise their guard, their standards and so on, no, all they do is give us a half baked update with 'Heavy VS Pyro', which feels like an excuse to not give us a full update from the getgo and stall about a month more out of us for the update. If VALVe simply asked what we wanted and said that the update was gonna take longer than expected, we would understand. Most of the TF community would be happy knowing that VALVe didn't abandon us, and is working on the game, meanwhile adding the voting system to the game to see which class people wanted to see more get the update.  And finally, my biggest gripe with TF2 currently, it's more personal and I know I'll get ridicule over it, but the lack of MAC support. I run TF2 on MAC, which some might call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but at least I run TF2 at 230 FPS. Well WOULD run it. The game is in such a state where the MAC support died off about 3 months ago. The game constantly crashes with the error 'Out of memory' or because the game failed to load a single texture. Not to mention the game loads textures ONE AT A TIME. For MAC users, the first hour is a struggle seeing how long the computer takes through freeze frames, lag and so on while it painfully loads every graphic one at a time. So for the most time, you're in a server with all the graphics either blurry or missing while they load in, which has taken me upward to 3 hours on 2Fort alone. Also, the game freezes in the menu, in game or, most commonly, in the 'Retriving Server Info' part of the loading screen. I'm not sure if windows/Linux also have these issues, but every glitch causes the MAC to crash in some way or another. There's even been instances where my entire computer, not just TF2, but all of it crashed due to TF2 failing to load me in. The last true patch MAC ever got was about 1 year ago in gun mettle, where VALVe did some fixes to help with crashes caused by the update. Also, anybody on windows/linux mind telling me if the game also runs like that on their computers? This is a TF2 only issue, GMod runs fine, CS:GO runs fine, but TF2 doesn't.  The game used to be great, but the currently influx of bad updates, bugs, glitches and crashes completly destroyed a game that used to be great. Doesn't even feel VALVe is the one making the game anymore. It feels like EA or god-fobid Ubisoft took the wheel with this game."
I have invested 2600+ hours into this game. I could have learned how to read and speak a new language. I could have volunteered at a homeless shelter. I could have improved my business portfolio. I could have watched all 551+ episodes of The Simpsons. Ten times. Mercury has orbited the sun in the amount of time I played this game.  I played this game so you didn't have to.
"10/10 Team Fortress 2 is so different from any other FPS. It has a great sense of humour, it's really fun to play and never gets boring due to the never-ending content.  P.S. I'm only doing this to level up my steam, I ♥♥♥♥ING HATE THIS GAME. :)))))"
This game is dead to me.
"So ask me even a year ago if you asked me if you should play TF2, I'd reply 'Wait, I haven't already told you to play?'  Now, the answer is a solid 'No.'  I can forgive stupid balance changes, the additions of several unfinished and abandoned features, an obnoxious obsession with cosmetics and a community as toxic as they come, because hey, it's Valve's sandbox where they test the features to put into their more successful multiplayer titles.  But I'm not writing a review for any reason other than it is now effectively impossible to have a quick, fun casual experience. I'll admit that even after formally 'quitting,' I'd still take some time to play a short pub game on a Valve supported server every so often. Now though I can't even do that.  Like having to wait in a queue for a game when you previously didn't? Like being penalized if you get called away and can't finish your match? Like an obnoxiously low FOV that makes your eyes strain? Like having no other option than to join some teenager's plugin filled nightmare of a community server? Then hey, this is the update for you.  Also, the idea of having the only two options for being able to play a competitive game be 'Give us ten bucks' or 'Give us your phone number' is disgusting, and the kind of thing I'd expect from a lesser company like EA. Grow up, Valve, you're doing way more damage then Overwatch ever could."
"I used to love the game but since the new menu interface and the fact that you can't join a specific gamemode anymore ( You have to atleast select two gamemodes to join). Also, if you want to wait 20 - 40 minutes just to join one game that will end in 5 - 15 minutes. There trying so hard to keep up with Overwatch that they ruined the game. That being said, I do like the new player list that shows the type of players that are on your team at the top of the screen in game though."
it sucks
"I own more hats and cosmetic items in this game than I own clothes in real life.  After 2,000 hours spent blowing people up, setting people on fire, beating people to death with my bare fists, pushing a large explosive device in a mining cart along a track, trading hats for pieces of metal, and being riddled with bullets by a heat-seeking automatic turret - I think it's safe to say Team Fortress 2 is a pretty fun game.  Never gets old, fun to team up, or even duel your friends, and there's always more content around the corner. Free-to-Play, it'll give you a good laugh at times, and other times make you want to throw your monitor out the window in blind, crimson rage."
"Graphics are creative and funny, Controls are ultra-smooth and the game-play is FUN. FUN being the important word here. The game may look simple at first glance, but is a very complex shooter. Pretty much still a perfect game after all these years."
Ruined my life. But at least I have some hats. 5/5
The best dressup simulator.......FOR MEN.       with a mini-game that involves shooting and completing objectives.
"A game that will not only get you addicted to hats, but also hyped up about bread!  The goal in this first-person shooter multiplayer video game is to choose a team (RED/BLU) and beat the other team in 8 different official game modes (king of the hill, capture-the-flag, push-little-cart…).  Inside a team you can select one of nine classes with each class having its strength and weaknesses which guarantees there’ll be a game style that fits you.  You can also play co-op where you team up with six other people to kill robots who came to attack the 'Mann.co Store'.  Besides these official game types there are many others created by the community such as a medieval, prophunt,..  If you ever get bored with playing, which is unlikely but it can happen after more than 2.000 hours, then you can always start collecting hats by trading, reason why it’s often referred to as the number one hat-simulator.  Before this game I wouldn’t even have considered playing any cartoon-like games. But I’m glad someone converted me. It’s a game that's filled with humor and will not get you bored easily. More importantly, it’s free, why shouldn’t you give it a try at least?  But the biggest advantage of all is that this is a very social game which you can play with friends. And for the people who don't have any friends: with this game you'll sure get some!  Even if this game has been out there for a while, it’s still being updated on a regular basis. New game modes and hats created by the developers and community are regularly being pushed forward and major events are happening at Halloween, Christmas and Easter.  There is only one downside I can think of: it’s quite large in size. So make sure you have enough disk space."
10/10 GOTY paid for my videocard :^)
"Why. Why did you change the age old formula that we all knew and loved?   Issues: 1. Match making takes way too long compared to being able to manually select games. 2. Disabled the voting system in casual. 3. Unable to select specific game modes. 4. As soon as the game finished I was taken back to the mode select screen to wait another 5 minutes.  I just played an entirely one sided game, and there was no option to scramble teams for balance. Simply not fun or fair or even manageable anymore."
is rly good
"Super fun game, if you're interested in solving crime this is definitely the game for you"
"Valve have systematically destroyed everything that made TF2 fun.  They opened the floodgates to bratty little smartarses on their big brother's hand-me-down PC or school laptop when they took a game with modest system requirements and made it free. The player community has since degenerated in to smack-talk and reciting memes stolen from ♥♥♥♥♥, which is a far cry from the game where Internet Tough Guys used to be told to '♥♥♥♥ off back to xbox live' and were promptly kicked. They also made it impossible to punish hackers by making the game free; a VAC ban just results in them opening a new account.  They encouraged poor form with weapons and 'killstreak kits' that incentivised playing like a tryhard (often at the expense of your own team and the objective).  They've provided the bare minimum in terms of support since their newer games started making bank. When balance changes come, they come with the most superficial understanding of gameplay dynamics and typically come with a six-months-to-forever wait for fixes to their fixes; they even admitted in a blog post that they simply nerf whatever is popular and buff whatever goes unused. They've straight-up declined to take any role in managing the in-game economy since adding a single new metal sink mechanic about three years ago, meaning players without a lot of disposable income are SOL when it comes to exchanging metal for keys or other goods. We're also now lucky if we get a single non-annual, non-community-developed content update a year - and even then, they're usually paid grind-fests for a bunch of reskinned guns.  They made netcode changes a few years back, allowing servers more control over client variables, which most community server operators have never managed to use constructively. To this day, most community-run servers play like crap (even when they're not running obnoxious mods). This wasn't so bad when Valve began running vanilla pub servers but they've since taken those away, too.  And now they're trying to turn a very dated game about silly hats and dance parties, with a playerbase who largely appreciated TF2 because it isn't Counter Strike or DOTA2 and wasn't trying to be, in to some 'esports' abomination. Even their 'casual mode', our supposed replacement for Valve pubs, has a giant lifetime kill/death counter displayed across the screen, attracting entirely the wrong sort and priorities in what was supposed to be an objective- and team-focused game. Never mind that their matchmaking system is next to useless if you feel like playing a couple of specific maps; you're either waiting for forever to get on your maps or you select every map and repeatedly end up on Turbine (albeit, pretty quickly) or you use the server browser to find one of the aforementioned terrible community servers.  It's great the Valve supported a game for as long as they did but, at this point, I suspect no stewardship at all would be less destructive than the half-arsed support the game receives now. What made TF2 special and what that one intern at Valve wants TF2 to be are two very different things."
 This game is free and yet it is one of the most popular games on Steam.  That says something.
Why would you play another game?
#BringValvePubsBack!
"Game was absolutely ruined by the new update that eliminated casual play. I only have a small window of time to play video games and don't want to wait 10 - 30 minutes to join a match between rounds. I have yet to be able to join a casual match since the update, actually. There was no reason to get rid of quick play in order to add matchmaking. Why completely redesign how your players experience a trusted product when competitors like Overwatch are spending so much to entice your user base away?  Anyone who doesn't get why this sucks, let me ask you something. Do you use Netflix? Imagine if you couldn't watch a new episode unless 23 other people in your area joined you. And then if you wanted to change the channel you would have to wait 10 minutes between videos. Does that sound like something you would spend money on? No. And before you cry 'FREE TO PLAY', you are missing the glaringly obvious reason why they went free to play to play in the first place: to increase microtransaction purchases. While I did happen to buy the game before it went free to play, I have also spent my fair share on the marketplace and in the shop. No more. Not so much out of spite but because there's no point in spending money on a game I. CAN'T. PLAY.  For a game that is almost 10 years old, I'm surprised that you, Valve, would choose NOW to tell such a thriving portion of your users to go @#$% themselves with unapologetic, casual laziness. The only rational explanation for this is that you are trying to drive your users to a more profitable product, perhaps CSGO. Because otherwise I can't imagine why you would risk scrubbing such a popular gamemode in the face of the first formiddable competition that has popped up for TF2 in a long time.  Someone at Valve gave you some really bad advice about risk taking. Stop trying to salvage it by making shoddy half-@#$ concessions; listen to your user base. You have a small window of opportunity to FIX THIS and reclaim the users that actually spend money on the game. Soon they will lose interest and move on. Competitive gamemodes do not attract casual users, and competitive players do not spend money on microtransactions. Experienced, competitive players do their trading on private servers between players, meaning no profit is going to Valve. Casual players don't have the time or expertise to put serious work into trade servers and so they spend money on the marketplace instead. So valve, unless your goal is to tank TF2's profitability, I hope you will consider getting rid of the obstacles that discourage casual players, such as penalties for casual playing but most importantly, get rid of the lobbies and let us go back to playing the game we loved."

"'Hate the player, not the game.' is the perfect quote that describes my feelings towards this game and it's community. Oh wait, this is a review for TF2, I almost forgot the most imporant thing. *Obligatory hat joke* That should do it."
"It's alright, pick it up during a sale I guess."
"Many hats, gg. Addicting."
"Best Hat-Collecting Simulator you can find on Steam!  Also has a decent FPS mini-game in it, all for free!    Also Conga    8/8"
"I loved this game to death, but Valve just stop caring about it and completely changed or removed what I liked about it. It saddens me to write this but I'm not playing this game anymore if it keeps going in this direction,"
Best free to play game ever made hands down. TF2 is the new standard by which all F2P shooters should assess themselves by. All hail Gaben and his Gibus.

I love you I love you I love you. I have never loved a game more than this.
most fun online with friends!
"Bad graphic, for kids, stupid gameplay, hatz"
This game is good look at how many hours i have on this game 10/10
It's ok.
"You will laugh, you will cry, you will think you're just going to get one hat and then you have 400,000 dollas put into this game. also there are guys that call you a horse♥♥♥♥er. that's your cue to laugh.   Fo srs  Pros: Lots of variety for classes if you dont like playing a color swap military man with a different gun. One half of the community is nice and sees you with open arms(no homo) Art style is very good, Lots of community content for more variety with game modes isnt neccesarily pay to win, moreover its a 'pay to get that medic to uber you and your fancy hat' MvM is good if you want to kill capitalist robits  Cons: Other half of the community is a cesspool of rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that will make fun of you for not spending 400,000 dollars on a hat with an orbiting benis spinning around it. Very demanding for a constant framerate. usually needs a config to get one. Pyros are F@ggots  4/5 Kill all the m2 pyros"
"I want the old team fortress back, horrible update.  They turned casual into ♥♥♥♥, you can't even choose what map you want to play, only game modes... Adding ranks to casual is as stupid idea to begin with, tryhards everywhere.  Team Fortress 2 used to be a fun game, now it's lived it's life if you ask me. Time for Overwatch."
It's good.
"Welcome to the soon-to-be Cartoon CS:GO! It's a great game with great players! For Example: 'PonyFlame456xX: LOLOL m8, u got rekt. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)' There's great teamwork! Hence the TEAM fortess 2 For Example:  'Medic! Medic! Medic! Medic! Medic!' 'PonyFlame456xX: Lay off, the spy needs it more. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)' This is a 10/10 game. I reccomend this game to all! Don't let that 'Free 2 play' fool you either. I had the same mentality, about 2 years later, $2k out of my wallet."
csgo is better
"Problems with Tf2 now: -Malicious players rarely recieve bans, and can still greif servers with no problem -Competitive has a multitude of bugs, such as not recieving the correct amount of XP, DE-RANKING if earning a large amount of XP, not losing XP after disconnect, and not even trying to match you with people of similar ranks -Casual games are usually barely over 7-10 minutes; cue times are about 5-8 minutes, and you need to re-que once a game ends -Valve has little to no communication with the majority player-base -Valve takes all feedback from a competitive mindset -Valve practically has no play-testers for new updates -Servers have tendancies to lag or just have shoddy connection, or be far from your location -There is no longer a quickplay option -Few weapons which actually needed balancing, got balanced -Most weapon fixxes were unnecessary or ridiculous -The Third Degree remains the only stock upgrade, somehow -Casual games usually end right as you join them -Competitive can be accessed by a barely working phone link system, or you shell out cash -Community servers are commonly plagued with ads, plugins, horribly moderated games, abusive administrators, or just Tf2, but done wrong -The Server Browser is innefective at finding ideal servers, as it has not been updated at all to acomidate to the traffic brought by the removal of pubs -The server browser is the same one from Half Life, a game from OVER 20 YEARS AGO -Valve does not test these updates before shipping them out, these contain bugs, exploits, or missing features -Valve has been slow at fixing errors -Overral, the game sucks now  Notes on this subject: -Pubs are STILL absent, even after massive backlash -The recent reviews section of the Tf2 store front has gone from Extremely Positive, to Mixed, within a MONTH. [Keep posting negative reviews, we need to get this through Valve's thick skull, make the 'Mixed' go to Negative!] It's gone to Very Positive. Just as an update..  The Few Decent Changes:  -Competitive, while in a broken state, IS in the game -Casual would have been fine if added along-SIDE pubs -If your game crashes or you time out, upon loading the game, it asks you if you'd like to reconnect to the server you were on  Extra Notes:  -The argument, just join a good community server, is incredibely stupid. There are only about some several hundred servers that are ad free, plugin free, and have good admins, and most have a server capacity of 24, the player count is in the thousands! Tens! Hundreds! -The argument of 'Valve is fixing it' is also stupid, it is not fixed, Valve will likely take months to fix this. [They've fixed most of the errors, but some major ones are still present] -Some assume that once Valve fixxes Tf2 by adding back pubs, it'll become sunshine and rainbows again. Wrong. Valve still has the potential to release an update just as bad, or even worse than Mym, it's likely that the community would be better off if Valve handed over most of the development to the community. [Likely, the hate will be so strong, that the negative reviews and player number drops will continue, even after pubs were added back] -The argument of 'Why are you complaining, just accept it, you're being ungrateful', ungrateful, we should be grateful for a sh`it update, poor treatment of a formerly great game, and lack of communication between Valve and the community? Fu`ck NO.  How good were the updates I experienced [My opinion]:  Love and War: Pretty good, however I found the new weapons when they came out were a bit underwhelming.  End of the Line: Extremelly dissapointing, this was an overhyped, rushed mess. Having only some cosmetics, a weapon reskin, a map that got CUT! And was based on a pretty meh SFM.  Gun Mettle: Ehh, the Tf:Go thing was very offputting, it felt wrong in Tf2. A bunch of weapons got dumb changes *Scorch Shot I'm looking at you*, but some were necessary *The Loch N' Load nutering was not necessary though*  Invasion: Almost exactly like EOTL, cosmetics, a bunch of weapon reskins, a few neat maps, a reskin of a map, and some  crates...yay?   Tough Break: Worse than Gun Mettle, brought back the Tf:Go thing, introduced stupid weapon changes.. *R.I.P Charge N' Targe* *Phlog...is satan*. And generally, was not good.  Scream Fortress 2015: So dissapointing, reskinned contracts 'merassmisions', bland cosmetics, bland game modes, reskinning sd_doomsday for no reason at all, no one plays that; and added some generic taunts.  Meet your Match: Atrocious, Valve could not do worse at execution of an update: LOOK UP FOR INFO.  Scream Fortress 2016: Look down bellow for my ♥♥♥♥♥ing about this mediocre...thing.  Future Update Opinions:  -I believe that the Pyro update coming...whenever... will give us some unbalanced flamethrowers, reskins, more flare guns [Cause we need more! Flare 4 Shotgun 2], dumb changes, and misc. dumb additions  -I believe Scream Fortress 2016 will also be dissapointing, maybe reskin cp_degrootkeep, or tc_hydro, dumb cosmetics, and boring game modes. [UPDATE] Scream Fortress 2016 is somewhat what I expected: -Bland cosmetics -Uninspired crate system -No new content -A ♥♥♥♥ing game break for Macs when it came out -Broken Merrasmisions -A few neat maps, too bad one is for pd...you even play that?  -The next big update will likely be just as damaging as Mym, or just as bland as EOTL"

"Such a great game, it's so easy to have fun whilst playing on a pub, and with your friends. MVM is also a great place to have fun :)"
"I have no Life, I have a Strange addiction to Hats, Abnormal but acceptable amounts of memes. I love this Game."
"This game has turned into absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Why they gotta turn every fun game into a abomination that you can't recover from.  If you don't afford or don't want to play the competitive mode, you'll have to wait a ♥♥♥♥ing lifetime to get into a casual match, in which if you leave you're gonna get a penalty.  I'd rather play overwatch over this anyday now with this update, like seriously Valve, stop destroying games."
"How people see tf2: 1-10 hours: Look mummy this reminds me of Tom And Jerry Xddd 10-50 hours: Oh look i just found 10 euros tf2 weapon, i can sell it irl and be rich, fagola. 50-100 hours: I'm not p2p 100-200 hours: Hats, hats, hats, hats!!!... 200-500 hours: I wasted so much money... 500-2000 hours: I love to ♥♥♥♥ people off. 2000-20k hours: lol idk 20k-30k: dead"
"You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain. I hate to admit it but the game defeated me. I used to not give a f*** about hats, killstreaks or expensive items in general. Then I traded my first hat, my first rare item. As time went, I desired more and more and more. Suddenly, it was not about playing but collecting pixels. The game got me. The joy was replaced with greed. I had to pull the plug. I had to escape. I have became ONE OF THEM. This is no longer a harmless video game. It is a dealer and you are the junkie. Avoid it or suffer as I and many others did. Your call."
"I used to love this game...  ...But that was before the plague hit.  And with plague I mean the ridiculous meet your match update that forced 99% of community server owners to shut down their servers for good, and forced everybody to go full tryhard, sucking all the silly fun out of the game.  Stuff like jumping across the map and suicide bombing snipers with the caber are mere memories now.  And don't get me started on the hackers. As of the meet your match update, I'm yet to find a match where there isn't atleast 1 guy using lm@obox spinhax. This, paired with all the people whom are protective of said cheaters (I recently got kicked for literally pointing out that there was a spy with infinite cloak duration and backstabbing people while invisible, which was 100% true mind you) makes for the perfect cancer milkshake.  Trust a TF2 veteran, who's been playing since 2008, when I say that this game is dead. There is no reason to play it anymore with stuff like Paladins and Overwatch around. They do a much better job at the whole 'competitive team based shooter' thing, then Valve trying to shoehorn it into TF2 due to the success of said games."
"Okay, I'm making one last review for this game until Valve goes out of their way to make it fun again, and no it's not pretty because I just hit 'Negative Review'  First of all, the game began out as a fresh, inspiring FPS with a surprisingly huge amount of good balance, there were no cheap shots overall. The classes were fully ironed, fleshed out, and so much full of character, it was basically set in motion and written in stone that it was a good game. I would have even considered it better than 0verwatch now...WOULD..if they haven't changed the game at all since launch.  1. Weapons  Then, this is where things got ugly...as much as people disagree with me on this (I laugh it off anyway), they started adding updates to the game, where NEW weapons were made for each of the classes over time. First with the pyro's new weapons, which horribly caused so much chaos on how unbalanced the Backburner was at launch along with medics taking priority on not healing anybody and attempting to kill with their ubersaws, and truly made the demoman way too powerful with crits. They of course nerfed the backburner, but instead of just calling it quits and reworking their new update system they brought out the same thing for the rest of the classes, bringing changes that completely stopped the balance of the gameplay. Oh, but that didn't stop at the Engineer update, no sir! They brought in sets you had to PAY to be able to use their abilities, or spend a god knows amount of time trading/crafting to get them all (not to mention they were INCREDIBLY overpowered). Luckily Valve realized this was an idiotic choice and removed it...3-4 years later. Lastly they started just shooting new weapons with broken stats every month for a while, the worst part being is that PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIKED THIS.   Considerably I think the weapon system they brought in was a severely mediocre choice overall, as it's harder to tell what weapon/tool they are wielding before they use/shoot it at you or the weapon itself is big and shiny in appearance. It's also bad because it created 'weapon metas' that should've never existed. In my opinion if they wanted to keep the game updated gameplay-wise, they should have gone with 0verwatch's philosophy with making new classes, so players know what to expect when facing said class instead of keeping them guessing what loadout one carried.  2. Cosmetics  Now I know what one is thinking 'Why on earth would you think cosmetics ruined this game?', well it's a long story, but sit along as I tell you it. When hats first launched in 2009, this is where another big vision of where TF2's downfall began. Players started to find ways to exploit the crafting system that came with it, where they started to 'idle' and do nothing for a god knows amount of time just to grab pointless, virtual hats. This, without a doubt, was breaking the point of the game to actually play the game. Valve tried to combat this by giving halos and cleaning backpacks of all those who walked into a Idle server, but this only made matters worse where a very dumb war between halo wearers and not halo wearers broke loose. It cooled down afterawhile, but things only got worse with hats when Mannconomy released.  Not only the broken, P2W hat sets were released, but they have also brought in 'a pay an expensive amount for virtual hats and weapons store', 'crates', 'Artstyle-breaking paintbuckets', and last of all 'Trading'. All of these things have really broke TF2's kneecaps as it started to diminish and absolutely destroy what made people come to love it, but newcomers were absolutely fooled by it's new appearance 'Hat Fortress 2'. Ever since then, TF2's identity when one first thinks of the name, they automatically think of 'Hats'. Overtime they just transitioned to stopped caring about the gameplay and focus more on their biggest money-wasting machine by purely making TF2 updates just for hats. Then later on over the years, they decided to really screw what's left of the game by adding in taunts which have COMPLETELY PUT ACTUAL GAMES TO A SCREECHING HALT. Guilty to say, it was funny at first, but then later is just got annoying and very stupid. It has died down, but nothing is more annoying than wanting to actually play the game when there's a party of conga-goers doing nothing. 'Friendly' is just a stupid idea overall, but unfortunately apart of the game which a lot people seem to have an attitude over playing the objective.  More taunts went on through making TF2 even more of a joke than it was now. You'd think they would have known this already has done too much damage to the game beyond repair, but you're wrong. They have brought in the 'skins' from CS:GO and the Campaign pass, straight up copy and paste along with the 'take the enemy's weapon' function from CS:GO. VALVe is definitely on a quest on seeing how low TF2 can get with it's cosmetics and good lord they are proving it so.  3. Community  Now too be fair, this section is entirely out of VALVe's hands and entirely because of the people who played this game. However, Valve should've taken precautions and think what said humans were going to think and do when said new features were added, like when adding the conga for example. The community was really great at first, nothing but smart people and talented artists showed up here to play, it was nothing short than amazing to see such a gathering. Overtime unfortunately, Valve completely started tainting the game's community as they decided to open it up for F2P to 'compete' with other Free-to-Plays such as League of Legends.  Since then, the community has been grouped and filled with numbskulls who always question Pyro's gender, or like Valve's business scheme without questioning it. Then of course when Valve deterred away from making anymore weapons, that's when the age of whining began. People left and right outright begging Valve to nerf Pyro, remove gunslinger, F2P vs P2P discrimination, and make more game-breaking weapons as well as usually consider themselves good at the game by using a complete crutch. It was toxic and it still is.  4. Update Management  VALVe always has been quiet when it comes to updates, put a good amount of hype, and used to really tweak out performance issues. Not saying they were great, but they certainly seemed like some manpower was involved in them. Unfortunately as time moved on, Valve has moved on more developers into other projects or even firing some who have done a considerable job, this resulted in TF2 suffering because of this. Updates ended up becoming more mediocre and has more questionably dumb choices in every single one, even flat out removing all the promised objects from End of the Line and ruined the hype that built up for it overall, making others like me completely lose all hope for the game. Not to mention the game has been harsh on older computers as FPS has gone haywire with the amount of cosmetics making performance a nightmare unless you have a really good gaming PC like I do. However, having a really good PC does not excuse Valve for making it poorly optimized.  Worst part is, I  hate  sounding like the bad guy towards TF2.  This game has seen MUCH better days than it has now.  Well, I'm considering an offer to Valve that if they can make me play it like before, I'll remove this review entirely and move on. Unfortunately it seems that today isn't that day, thus Overwatch for me."
"I was gonna write a review, but I assumed it would be too confusing for new players. Instead, here's the wikipedia entry for Ducks:  Duck is the common name for a large number of species in the Anatidae family of birds, which also includes swans and geese. The ducks are divided among several subfamilies in the Anatidae family; they do not represent a monophyletic group (the group of all descendants of a single common ancestral species) but a form taxon, since swans and geese are not considered ducks. Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, mostly smaller than the swans and geese, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water.  Ducks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water birds with similar forms, such as loons or divers, grebes, gallinules, and coots.    The word duck comes from Old English *dūce 'diver', a derivative of the verb *dūcan 'to duck, bend down low as if to get under something, or dive', because of the way many species in the dabbling duck group feed by upending; compare with Dutch duiken and German tauchen 'to dive'.  This word replaced Old English ened/ænid 'duck', possibly to avoid confusion with other Old English words, like ende 'end' with similar forms. Other Germanic languages still have similar words for 'duck', for example, Dutch eend 'duck' and German Ente 'duck'. The word ened/ænid was inherited from Proto-Indo-European; compare: Latin anas 'duck', Lithuanian ántis 'duck', Ancient Greek nēssa/nētta (νῆσσα, νῆττα) 'duck', and Sanskrit ātí 'water bird', among others.  A duckling is a young duck in downy plumage[1] or baby duck;[2] but in the food trade young adult ducks ready for roasting are sometimes labelled 'duckling'.[citation needed]  A male duck is called a drake and the female duck is called a duck, or in ornithology a hen.   The overall body plan of ducks is elongated and broad, and the ducks are also relatively long-necked, albeit not as long-necked as the geese and swans. The body shape of diving ducks varies somewhat from this in being more rounded. The bill is usually broad and contains serrated lamellae, which are particularly well defined in the filter-feeding species. In the case of some fishing species the bill is long and strongly serrated. The scaled legs are strong and well developed, and generally set far back on the body, more so in the highly aquatic species. The wings are very strong and are generally short and pointed, and the flight of ducks requires fast continuous strokes, requiring in turn strong wing muscles. Three species of steamer duck are almost flightless, however. Many species of duck are temporarily flightless while moulting; they seek out protected habitat with good food supplies during this period. This moult typically precedes migration.  The drakes of northern species often have extravagant plumage, but that is moulted in summer to give a more female-like appearance, the 'eclipse' plumage. Southern resident species typically show less sexual dimorphism, although there are exceptions like the Paradise Shelduck of New Zealand which is both strikingly sexually dimorphic and where the female's plumage is brighter than that of the male. The plumage of juvenile birds generally resembles that of the female.   You must pay $5 USD to continue reading"
"It's a war-based first-person shooter that ISN'T a bloody Modern Military Shooter (henceforth referred to as MMS). What's not to like? Granted, the game has become overtaken with hats. But I'd say that's one of the reasons Valve decided to make the game free-to-play. They've received enough money from it thus far, and they don't need to rely on the money from every purchase to keep the game going.  Unlike most MMS games, this one isn't re-released every single year with 1 or 2 minor changes and with a new name slapped on it. This game undergoes, just like other Valve games (and a lot of other Steam games for that matter), perpetual evolution without the need to be re-released.  Sure, it has no single-player campaign. But there's the Portal and Half-Life series of games for that. It's a varied game with plenty of game modes that all run on the same sort of infrastructure but are different in varying ways. It's a good game. I'd recommend it.  "

Best multiplayer game ever created!
Rest in peace.  Again. It'll be for good this time.
"Going on 8 years and still doing very well for itself, TF2 is a testament to Valve's dedication and consistent content support across all their games. TF2 is unique because it's ostensibly undergone the biggest changes of any of Valve's other games, through hundreds of free updates. To some, that's a bad thing - that TF2's initially unique and intelligent art direction has been diluted with hats, cosmetics and things that seem to make no visual sense. But it adds layers of customization, trading and player interaction that form a remarkable metagame. The new weapons and maps have done nothing but add extra replayability and depth to the game - and it even has its own active competitive scene.  Then you have things like Mann vs Machine, the custom server community and their unique player-made mods and you have an experience that still has a lot of life in it and a seemingly endless supply of... well, game. Oh, and it's free."
the community is bad
Best game ever play. The end.
"Awesome game, lots of birds in Halloween servers which just gives a reason to keep playing it.  10/10  Would throw bread crumbs at birds anytime."
NOT COOL VALVE NOT COOL you basically ♥♥♥♥ed yourself up please bring back the old TF2m i miss it already
"Team Fortress 2 is deffo the best game i have ever playied! i hate to compare it to other FPS but this one has kept my attention for a long time unlike cod and others! you can tell valve put alot of work and effort into their games and it shows in the qaulity in thier work! valve always update the game and keep making it better and better, its 1 of my fav game's of all time!! :)  dont waste any more time reading this reveiw, just download the game and i garrantee you will enjoy and love the game! what do you have to lose, its free to play!"
"The new update is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. And now I can't even access my ♥♥♥♥ing items or any servers, other than training and community maps. I also see that you have added a competitive mode now, and that you can get a temporary ban from leaving a casual match. I thought TF2 was supposed to be different than CS:GO, but I guess if I want to play CS:GO I could just play TF2 instead because they're the exact same game now. Thanks Valve. ♥♥♥♥ you."
" Team Fortress 2, a game long joked about being a war-themed hat simulator should be praised, and here is why.   Team Fortress 2 is a game I believe can really fit with all kinds of gamers, from all kinds of scenes. Whether you're into MOBAs, already into FPS's, or just a general player of games, TF2 can find some way to work itself into your heart.   Part 1: The Classes   The classes in Team Fortress 2 are all well-balanced characters that fit into a special role of a team, their well-craftedness leaves the real struggle to the player to make the class shine above all others. The roles of each class don't even stop at what the class could really do. There are so many sub-classes and builds and weapons that change how the entire game functions, it's versatility expands far beyond just what it's labelled as. The classes and their wonderfully fleshed-out personalities with different backgrounds helps you to invest in them and really become a part of them, and possibly have them become a part of you.   Part 2: The Weapons   Weapons in TF2 aren't really improvements to the stock, which makes it different than alot of other games. They're another type of playstyle, another way to play the game. Want the Heavy to be even more of a damage dealer? Use the Brass Beast. Want a reward for all those headshots you're getting as Sniper? Use the Bazaar Bargain. The weapons help broaden the possibilities and types of play of the game, chances are you won't meet players with the same loadout, and even better chances you won't find them using the same kind of playstyle. All in all, I know there might be some sour apples in the bunch, but the range of weapons and the manners in which you can use them is spectacular, and helps others find classes they like.   Part 3: The Hats   You knew this was coming, admit it. The game's cosmetic system isn't all that there is, but it's one hell of a huge chunk. Ever since the first few hats were added, it changed the game. From the beginning, it was one for one, a hat for a hat, but soon, the seed of economy was planted. The economy grew and flourished, values were established. currencies were made, and the true spirit of the war-themed hat simulator came to fruition. The economy is a real shining gem in this game, while prices may seem absurd, it really is astonishing how a video game managed to grow an economy that easily translates virtual goods into monetary value with the unboxing of a crate. The community lives around this creation, molds it, creates it, they coexist peacefully and abide by one another's rules. Not only does the market shine, but the cosmetics themselves, too. Each piece can be equipped together in no specific order (aside from some restrictions with clipping, of course), meaning a bunch of combinations for your signature, unique look. This furthers the customization from weapons, and really helps to make you, you.   Overall   In the end, TF2's a flexible game. No matter what genre of game you're most accustomed to, TF2 will have a place in your heart. Interesting, quirky characters set in the middle of nowhere, fighting over who-knows-what. Plenty of methods of customization to make it fit you. A community that's pretty darn great, and a good bunch of pretty-looking hats. This game more than earns my 10/10, for as much as it counts.  (P.S. It's flippin' free!) "
Game is pretty good.
"The game gets worse every year/every update. Instead of keeping it as a cool , fun game as it was, valve is tryharding to make it a competitor of Overwatch, and fails horribly. In the last years, Valve ruined the art style, the performance, the balance, and the atmosphere with forcing the competitive playstyle (which is kinda the opposite of what TF2 was made for) . Lately they ruined the matchmaking too(which seems like a trend for them nowadays.. khmm.. l4d2 official servers khmm...), so you have to wait 15 mins to join to a horribly unbalanced match (often there are 3-4 player differences between teams), just to be forced to rejoin the matchmaking after the end of the match. Basically the gameplay is a big queue window now. The developers are focusing so hard to suck out every little possible penny from the game (hello microtransactions, hello ticket system) they dont care about the player experience.   You know those series which should have ended like 2-3 seasons ago, while they were good, but the writers just ♥♥♥♥ed it up and now they are the parody of themselves? TF2 is the gaming version of that. Would be better to just shut it down, before all the good memories fade.   tl;dr: You are 3-5 years late for a good TF2. Now its a tryhard copy of better games."
4/10 would play pubs again!
"After Meet your Match update, finding a game is the same like finding a girlfriend.  Impossible."
"I wished I could reach the 1000 hours, maybe I will but apperantly Valve is trying everything to stop me from doing that. I've played this game for something like 3 years now. but last year when Valve tried to 'improve' Tf2 and the matchmaking system, they only made things worse.   First there was the Gunmettle update where they introduced CSGO (Counter Strike Global Offensive) like skins that you could unbox. Nothing wrong with it right? Yeah I thought the same but instead of introducing new weapons and making the game more fun they came with a few more 'updates' introducing more and more weapon skins instead of the new weapons that everyone wanted. After the weaopn skins they began throwing with the same idea but with cosmetics. They are doing this to this day. On every mayor event like Christmas or Halloween they just dump more stupid cosmetics and useless taunts into the game.   But thats not even the worst part. They completely destroyed the matchmaking system as I (we) knew it. In the beginning you could just go into server browser and join any server you liked. It was easy and very usefull because if you only had a few minutes to spare you could just join a server, play a few rounds and leave the server. Over the past six months though Valve introduced the 'improved matchmaking system' which meant that you were no longer able to choose your server the old fashioned way. instead you were dropped into a que like CSGO and had to wait for the game to put you into a match.   A few thing about that:   1. The first few weeks after realease you had to wait like 15 minutes to be able to join a game. And you would probably in a team with 3 other players. So instead of 12v12 you got a 4v4, sometimes a 6v8 or a 6v10.   2. you could not choose your own maps in the first weeks after release so you were just hoping that you would be joining a game mode/map that you liked.   3. They added this levelling system where you gain exp by playing games. This destroyed the drop-in drop-out way of playiing completely and the fun pasrt is that to this date you get nothing for leveling up. No rewards, nothing.   4. they added competive play in Tf2 which had the same problems as casual mode, No servers so long waiting times. Ranking up still doesn't work. and people leaving the match where not penalized at all, at least not in a significant way.   A few Weeks ago they released 'improved matchmaking' and the whole circus just starded all over again. the low match population, the unfair/unbalanced teams it is AGAIN back at the bottom of the pit.  This version of Tf2 is just a shadow of it's former self. You should rally try the game but you shouldn't get attached to it because one day it might all be over with Team Fortress 2  Thanks for reading Guys&amp;Girls  You can always add me if you have any questions"
"This game could potentially be a life long friend of mine. Yearly Christmas &amp; Halloween updates, large to medium content updates throughout the year, bugs crushed within weeks, and smaller updates sprinkled in. This game's longevity is certainly one of it's many strengths.  As an FPS with so many weapons and features, it remains extremely comprehensive and balanced (Regardless of what most players say). Weapons are added every now and then, and current weapons' stats are always under inspection for balance issues. The control is extremely tight as all source games are, movement always seems fluent and never clunky. The skill ceiling for movement/mobility is extremely high and allows for lots of very tricky moves (eg. Rocket/sticky jumping, sentry jumping, strafing, etc..) Generally the skill ceiling for TF2 is very, very high; with almost 3,000 hours at the time of posting this i am nowhere near the skill level of more experianced players.  The community is still strong and persistant as the game ages and brings in new players. An overall friendly and welcoming community awaits new players, as well as a thriving competitive scene in both Europe and the States. Not to mention the incredible fan-created artwork and short films on youtube and other sites. TF2 has an incredibly involved trading scene which was born from the staggering amount of hats and cosmetic items that you can get. The trading scene can be brutal at times, but nothing quite stands up to the feeling of getting a sweet new item after spending time trading up for it. (Oh and did i mention you can sell TF2 items for PayPal cash if you're advanced enough?)  In summation, Team Fortress 2 is a game for the ages. This game has something for everyone if you look for it, and you'll undoubtedly meet some amazing people and make new friends."

"You will learn the meaning of TEAM, playing Team Fortress 2. Bloody fun!"
this new update SUCKS
"this used to be a valve payload-friendly game  now it's a sit in queue with your boys because the game is trying to find a server with good ping for everyone in your party for 30 minutes simulator  i can't be doing like this  alternatively this game is much better than overwatch by virtue of movement actually existing  here's an anecdote  i was playing scout, got ♥♥♥♥ on, pressed e and didn't get all my health back  this is good game design"
this new update SUCKS
Simply the best game ever.
"I'm playing this Game for Years now and regret no sec of it. This isn't a game about killing, become the best or even Hats for that matter. (yes I just said that! deal with it) You can play it like any other competetive Game but that is't the moste awesome part of TF2. This is the only Game i know where friendly Players (People who don't attack you) have spezial names. This is the only shooter i know where you can dance with your enemys in many diffrent styles. And it has the Best commiunity ever! (Just my stupid opinion Bro no offence ^^)  This isn't just a game you can play with your friends. In this game you can meet new awesome people every day. Here is (nearly) everybody welcome (just don't annoy the other guys on the server ^^)  11/10 would Buy that Hat again"
"team fortres 2 on steam is free for good download it now!! thay made a new fre 4 play secion   (my friend, 2011)"
What could be better than TF2?
"this game singlehandedly ruined my life, 10/10"
"This is a kind of game that become my diet, Playing Regular xD"
kinda Good and Fun game to play with friends.  (Still have have some many buqs and alot of cheater but i still vote up for TF2) 
its okay i guess
"Why don't I recommend this game? Because it's total trash now. Before the Meet your Match update, TF2 was a fun, lighthearted, shooter/hat-simulator. Now though, it has been ruined for me and for many others because of the removal of pubs, and casual turned into a worse version of competitive. I would've definitely recommended this game before Meet your Match, but now, not at all."
"Team Fortress 2 is the best free-to-play first person shooter in the world today. It's pure free-to-play, which means that everything is available at the beginning. You don't have to spend money on this game, except when you want to trade or buy cosmetic items.&nbsp; So what is this game all about? Well, you play in team of 1 to 12 (or even more) players and you try to beat the other team. TF2 features several gamemodes, Capture Point and Payload for example, and 9 'classes'. Each class has it's own pros and cons, and can be used for specific tasks. For example, the Engineer is a great defender and the Scout is very effective in capture-based gamemodes. TF2 is very n00b-friendly, since the game features Offline Training against bots and tutorials, as well as the coöp tower-defense gamemode Mann vs. Machine. TF2 is a relatively simple game, you don't require a lot of knowledge to be good at it. The game also has a large economy of items, which you get by playing or trading. These are pure cosmetic, except most weapons, and don't give you an advantage towards other players.  Verdict -------- This game is very enjoyable and funny, it's very different compared to other FPS games. It features several awesome gamemodes and funny classes. Some of the cosmetics are really funny, you can hit people with a mackerel and candy for example. An awesome free-to-play shooter you should play today.  Your friends will not see you outside for at least 100 hours. If you become a 'TF2 Trader' you will spend at least 400 hours on this game.  Score: 89/100"
"I have to thank Team Fortress 2 for leading me for several thousand hours of gaming throughout the years. I love all the friends I made along the way aswell, but something changed in tf2. The community has nearly been abandoned by all the 'old' players leaving behind a community that comes off as toxic. TF2 used to be my favorite game while update and update have many asking what's the deal with all these let downs, VALVe has started giving TF2 the short end of the stick as CS:GO and DOTA 2 take the spotlight. As TF2 and the community is right now I don't recommend getting into it anymore, both the game and the community are now a drag."
Full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥s
"I don't even know where to start with this. This is only an FPS by definition as it stands out from all the rest.  After thousands of hours of playing this game, I can't praise it enough. The game play is fun, the characters are likeable, most maps are well-designed and enjoyable to play on, the game can be modded serverside (either minor tweaks or major game-changing overhauls) or played vanilla (which is amazing in its own right), and there's many class/weapon combinations to keep things interesting.  The game is entirely free but you may want to buy one item from the store to get premium so you can trade items (which you get randomly anyway), but it's only a dollar or something for the least expensive item. A small matter of convenience and cosmetic, really.  There are only two significant problems: most servers have random critical hits enabled (it's by default) that basically means you're screwed or dead simply because by random chance, you're gonna take 3x damage from a hit; the other major problem is that some weapons are unbalanced or unfun to play against, but it's not a huge problem in this game.  If you got a free night, check the game out. You may just be hooked for a long time. Easily the best game I've ever played and the one I've played most by far. And it's FREE."
I love playing TF2 but the decision to have The Meet Your Match update is really the worst idea ever...
"I'm gonna be honest, as I write this, my heart breaks with every word typed.   Tf2 used to be a wonderful game. Even A year ago it was the pinnacle of class-based shooters. Fun, fast paced, team-oriented, and easy to pick up/put down for new or busy players.  But now?  Its like seeing your father or mother slowly break down into an alchoholic   Going from once trusting and loving Valve to....this, whatever this is!  What I'm talking about is, of course, this backwards stream of updates that have been coming out. -We were promised updates to game modes, weapons, and maps, and all we got were reskins and hats. -We were promised better weapons balanced for the most powerful weapons in the game Instead? A buff. Something to even further ruin the day.  -Its just not fun even more, to hear '♥♥♥♥ you' when asking for less snipers  'Deal with it or quit' they say, like a repeating, drunken piper. -You want more weapons and maps? Too bad, you get weapon skins and Hats! -Whats that? A bug you say? Lets fix it 3 months later, have some more weapons skins, now shut up and good day! -The new ranking system is just that; a rank. Theres no reward for playing offense, defense or tank.  - Hope you dont like to heal, because only snipers and spies will be your deal -Finally, and perhaps worse of all, are the half-asses updates that actually BREAK the game. Its not that hard to do something less lame. Perhaps pulling an ear to your friends, families, and peers would help, BUT ALAS! They look as us, shrug, and yelp; 'Get over it, its our game, now give us more money, ignore the pain!'    Thank you  Edit: for those who don't like my rhyme, what I'm basically saying is Tf2 has become a garbage pail of its former self. Valve has shown countless times it does not care about this game anymore, especially with its updates that end up breaking the game more than usual. Not only that, but Valve seems to completely ignore and ♥♥♥♥ on the player. In this last year, we have 1 new sniper weapon, 1 new scout weapon, and 2 demo weapons that nobody uses because they are basically useless in comparison to the other weapons, yet Valve has only done 1 thing about it: Buffed a weapon called the phlogistinator, even though that's the OPPOSITE of what people want. Also, they put the 'free to play' tag on Tf2 but it is certainly NOT f2p. The whole premise of the game is character customization, yet unless you pay money you're not gonna do that. Hell, you can't even play the co-op mode without paying money. In the 1,300 hours I have played, only 2 items I have received for free.   The community is god awful. I get it, it's a casual shooter, but I shouldn't have to BEG people to play a medic or an engineer on a 12-person team. I shouldn't have to pick up the slack of my team (as shouldn't anyone) because of incompetence. Now, this isn't saying that new players shouldn't play, but even a new player should have SOME level of cognitive function. Aka: I shouldn't have to stalk a teammate because they don't know how to look up or look behind them. Or tell a medic to heal instead of fight. Or tell THAT THIRD ♥♥♥♥ING SNIPER TO NOT BE A SNIPER. Other than that, there are people who just DONT play the game. The stand in spawn or stand in the middle of the map over, and over, and over, and over.   And not to mention the kids, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, idiots, and trolls in the game. You thought COD was bad with kids? Try 18+'s with mindsets of a kid. Or a kid who literally just SCREAMS into the mic for no good reason. Yes you can mute these people but why do I have to? Hell, during last years Halloween valve had to force people to STOP killing each other in order to actually play the min objective: killing a boss. That gives an item. A FREE ITEM FROM A BOSS. Are these people stupid or just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s? You decide.   If I were an update tester for Tf2 right now, I'd leave a sticky note that just says 'fix it'"
"I never wanted to take Team Fortress 2 seriously.  I just wanted to play Payload Race. I just want to have fun.   November 26 update. I did it for the badge.  So, after it was very clear that Blissard has no idea what actually makes a game fun- I thought I'd return to TF2 to see the damage done to the game I dropped 4,000 hours in.  This game as it was, is still unplayable.  I joined a queue with my friend who could show me the ropes of the update. We queued for around five minutes for 'Quick'play and ended up joining a half finished game with the other team doing a death push. Two minutes later they won, and we went back to queuing for another couple of minutes.  This is less TF2 than ever.  The fact that you have to queue so long just for what should be, as its name states, 'Quickplay' is just ridiculous. No one should be okay with this. I certainly wasn't. I was clearly spoiled by the pervious system where I would open the server browser, click the sort by Ping and join the most filled PLR Valve server on the list. This took only a couple seconds and I was in a game.  Beyond that, this new point system for quickplay is just balls. I don't want a rank. I don't want to collect points for my casual games. No one needs to know my skill level. If I want to just goof off with a gibus on, I want to be able to without ridicule or people knowing better. What made this game a blast for me was joining a very diverse Valve community server, pretending I was a noob, and waiting for the first guy who'd get too cocky about how good they were at wrecking new players and ruining their day.  So I tired finding a nice community server to play on, where it would be as close to the normal Valve Community server set up. (Spoiler: There are none)  The End  I have downloaded so many bad edits of maps from dead servers. Please consider bringing back quick joinable Community servers Valve."
"Best thing since sliced bread..  No, seriously. Fun in pubs and all, but once you start playing with others, talking, communicating, laying strats, executing them in the heat of battle, risking friendships ove petty discussions, Team Fortress 2 turns into more than just a cartoon shooter.  I don't even see the cartoon any more, all I see is 'overextended heavy, engineer is spy!, chokepoints and bombing soldiers'"
Sadly the new update broke the game

An extremely fun FPS game. Beautiful graphics and nice audio. It has a pretty fun gameplay and there are different modes. There are special items which you receive and then can trade or play with. There are crates which you receive as well and you can buy or trade keys to unlock the crates. You can also sell the crates. If you buy a TF2 item you start getting better drops which is pretty good. It's always fun to play TF2 and it's a good time killer as well. I really recommend downloading this game It's pretty damn fun! Rated 10/10!

R.I.P. TF2  10/7/2007 - 7/7/2016
"This game used to be good.  Then Valve decided it was a good time to crap on it. Every update no matter how big or small breaks the game in a unrelated way, usually to a point where it doesn't even want to run probably. There's a huge pile of weapons that are so horrible to play with it's not even funny any more. The most recent big update (Smissmass 2015 at the time of writing) basically made Pyro go from a class that takes some skill to a complete braindead W+M1 class. Demoknighting, the most fun thing to do in the entire game is now also dead and on anything but Windows this game doesn't run. At all. It just crashes instantly as soon as you go on a full server due to the horrendous coding job Valve has done (and they state performance is massively improved, yeah right, joke of the century). And all of this is packed in a 1:1 copy of the Gun Mettle update with even more ugly weapon skins that add no value to the game with the same boring and easy-as-crap contracts. Valve lost every single bit of sense on this game over the course of one update and there's no sign of that ever resolving itself. Oh and you wanted any of the cosmetics or weapons? Yeah you have to spend $6 on a campaign pass and then even more on a key to open the crate with the chance of you getting anything worth more than the combined cost of getting a crate and opening it are basically zero. Any future update will be a 1:1 copy of Gun Mettle since it's Valve's easiest way to make a ton of money without doing anything useful.  tl:dr this game would be much better if it was developed by anybody other than Valve.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this steaming pile of garbage. Honestly. Go play Overwatch or something."
Valve ♥♥♥♥ed up matchmaking.
"With more than 2k hours spent on this game, I can safely say it ruined my life!  10/10"
"...My oh my how the mighty have fallen.  I... love Team Fortress 2, I really do. If it wasn't for TF2, I would have spent a good year-ish on Xbox playing CoD or Minecraft or some crap instead of the 2007 TF2 that comes with the Console Orange Box. If it wasn't for Team Fortress 2 I wouldn't have gotten into Steam, let alone the beauty we know as PC gaming. Gaming is my... life? As sad as it sounds, it's the only thing I really do. Been gaming since I was like 5, haven't really found another hobby that stuck I guess. Now, I'm not gonna be one of those cancer af kids who says 'I wish it was 2007!!!!111!oneone!' because I was FORCED to play it for a year, trust me, you don't want 2007. 2012-ish? Yeah ya want that. What was once a great, genre-defining game is now an abandonment of Valve, now too busy caring for CSGO (which they're dropping the ball with, I give it a good 3, maybe less, years until it falls off the face of the earth) and their cash-cow sugar momma DotA 2. Also they kinda run Steam so yeah.  TF2's fall from grace comes from a lotta things. Greed, a horrid community (for f's sake just look at all the big YouTubers now, even THEY have drama) and rather... stale, gameplay. No new weapons, just more skins. No more maps, well, more maps, but years old community maps, just more unusual effects, cosmetics, a horrible economy, and a horrible way to ruin a game. As a casual shooter, you don't add matchmaking or competitive or appeal to the 2% of people who play UGC or whatever, you appeal to the majority.  Valve isn't doing that.  It disgusts me to play a competitive game and hear someone say 'lit 96' like it's CSGO. It disgusts me to play a casual (in other words, not quick-play, we coulda just had casual AND quickplay, but alrite Valve) game and have everyone worry about 'OMG WIN SO I CAN LEVEL UP EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT GETTING ANYTHING FROM I JUST WANNA LOOK COOL MAN!'  After 2,000 hours on PC, and probably a thousand+ more on console, I'm laying my TF2 career to rest. I used to bloody love this game, now I'm just gonna play Overwatch.  Because, yaknow, Blizzard can maintain a f'ing game.  Well.  WoW is garbo now but...  Shut up let me have this."
"Worst community i've ever experienced in my life. 80% are very angry American/English teenagers, %10 are whiners and ♥♥♥♥♥ers who accuse you of hacking just because you dominated them, and the other 10% are good players. The 80% are the absolute ♥♥♥♥ing worst though. They single you out by only killing you and calling you names. You don't even have to do anything to get singled out. They are too aggressive and they ruin the game. Countless times now I've been forced out of servers by these kinds of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and why I say 80% is because 75% of the server joins in with them to upset you. You could be the MvP for 5 rounds straight and STILL get no respect from anyone. It's odd behaviour, like a dog who just doesn't like a certain mailman for some completley unknown reason. They just hate your guts.  Because of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community, I can't play online anymore. It's not fun, and it ruins my day when I get bombarded by all sorts of uncalled ♥♥♥♥♥♥ names. All I wanted to do was just run around and kill people, not get called every name under the sun. So now I only play Offline Practice, and even that gets boring after a while. I've been playing Offline Practice for years, and Valve has hardly updated it. The bots are braindead sometimes, they don't use any weapons except vanilla, and the amount of maps is laughable. Players like me have been let down by Valve because of their neglect of the Offline Practice mode.  I find the game very fun, but I'm only playing around a quater of it. The rest of the game lies with the Online aspects, which I can no longer play because of TF2's disgustingly offensive community. The Offline bots may be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ most of the time, but at least they don't poke and prod you constantly trying to get you to leave the server."
NOT A SINGLE FORTRESS IN THE GAME. VERY MISLEADING.  WAS TOLD GAME WAS A 'HAT STIMULATOR.' HATS REMAIN THOROUGHLY UNMOTIVATED.  OVERALL VERY DISAPPOINTING.  2/10 WOULD NOT BANG.

"TF2 has changed...It's no longer about skill, stealing intelligence, capture control points, good moments or even hats. It's an endless series of taunting and dancing of conga, performed by players and bots. TF2 and its consumption of life, has become a well-feeding machine...TF2 has changed...Strange people carry strange weapons, use strange hats and mics. Servers control. Trading control. Statistic control. Everything is monitored and kept under control. The age of 'quality time with friends' has become the age of control. TF2 has changed... When everything is under control, 'fun'...becomes routine."
Not even words can express the greatness of this game...
Before 8 July 2016 TF2 was my favourite PC Game After 8 July 2016 TF2 is no longer TF2  It's stunning how Valve itself is destroying this game...
"This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels.  There are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'.  Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objectives for both teams to achieve.  'Mann Verses Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, 'Mann Up', gives rewards upon completing a 'tour'.  In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available.  In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them.  The game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play.      That's incredibly lucky check it out, 115 badges. I hope you get the reference.  "
I Giggled    Suprise!     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqyjOc3EpT4  69/69 Would ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Again!.
game was fun before meet your match and now it's ♥♥♥♥ and unplayable. Though valve has tried to help fix tf2 and everything it has not really helped. Valve added a rematch system but nobody votes for it because one side completly rage quits. Comp is a joke it's full of new players who think they are good. I would recommend this to people but it's gone too far at this point and people should really be staying away from tf2 and then valve might actually do ♥♥♥♥. Hit reg is also ♥♥♥♥ed up along with it's hitboxes so if you don't want to play a game where you can die to just one guy shooting a wall and you die randomly then don't play this game.  People could handle this ♥♥♥♥ before meet your match but ever since meet your match came it has killed tf2 and the so called great pyro update and the jungle update valve has promised ya ask anyone who has played before meet your match and they will all tell you it's going to be ♥♥♥♥. Tf2 is not playable anymore it's cancer. Also even though i voted for team pyro i still honestly hate pyro's. W+M1 pyro's are all scrubs and all pyro mains want pyro to be buffed more. Valve has already buffed pyro enough and it's time for some more nerfs because they love killing demoknight and love the pyro.  To all those who read this stay away from Tf2. No people who quit tf2 for overwatch are not really scrubs because they most likely quit because of this ♥♥♥♥. #VaveKilledTf2NotOverwatch
This Game in 2007 was a very different atmosphere creation.2015 But it still feels the different atmosphere.

Closer to you if you like the Pyro and Soldier. I Recommendations.If I suggest you choose the Quick If Class Scout. If You Like Minigun? Heavy's Suggestions.If You Want To Be a Secret Spy Killer 'm Preferences.Choose something you like to choose the Engineer class. This game is very legend!. I would strongly recommend that you download !!!!
"Review made by Kurakao, who had 2,566 hours of Team Fortress 2 while writing this review on 5.10.2014 (DD/MM/YYYY)  Includes: 1. TF2 from my PoV (Point of View) 2. About Team Fortress 2 3. Experiences &amp; details 4.1-3. About game-modes 5. Competitive in a nutshell 6. Recommendations from it 7. My own experiences and why 8. TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read aka this whole thing nutshelled in a sentence.) 9. My rating  1. What can I say? This is the reason I downloaded Steam. Because I wanted so hard to test this game out. I saw this game everywhere and I was always wondering like: 'Hmm.. What kind of a game this might be? Like Counter Strike mixed with it's own weirdness.' And I was half-true.  2. Team Fortress 2 is like mixing the Quake games, Counter-Strike, and a bit of fashion and hats all the way. This is the reason TF2 is so fun; You get to do any kind of hat/misc combinations (cosmetics these days) and you can create your own individual looks how people recognize you from others. I remember using funny combinations, so people recognized me easily and were like: 'Oh hey Kurakao! I just noticed you came in because I saw that awesome set of yours.'  3. Team Fortress 2 is extremely fun, team-based (depends what style you play. I play DM (DeathMatch) alot, which is basically just killing with no point), somehow restricted with the 9 classes, but doesn't restrict enough to not be individually weird-styled, and it's  extremely addictive .  4.1. I have never played anything as addictive as Team Fortress 2. This is extremely fun to play, and you can play any kind of gameplay you like: You can go either Saxton Hale (vsh_) maps to run away from the evil boss monsters that is controlled by a single player and he chases trying to kill you.  4.2. Then there's my favourite customs: PropHunt, which is the same as in GMOD; you disguise as an object and the enemies are trying to catch you. Firing your weapon decreases your hp so you need to be careful not to spam.  4.3. Then there are normal based maps; PayLoad, Capture Point, King of The Hill, etc. etc. which is hardly-based on teamwork and who plays what. It usually costs the team a victory if they are full-team Snipers or Spies or whatsoever, unless they are pro-tier players. But usually it ends up the team who has a better class-support, wins.   ----You can stop reading here and scroll down if you don't want to know anything about competitive---   5. Then there was competitive where I played some of my time. I was only Division 6 and I played as a Roamer. I had alot of friends who were either Division 6, or they were Division 5 or better, and some of them were as good as low-Division 2-1. Competitive is extremely fun, but it can be stressful sometimes if you take it too seriously.   6. I recommend taking it easy and having fun while having the pressure at the same time. This part requires great communication skills, and you need to have atleast a bit of social skills to learn to handle this. It's a great advantage if you play with your team other than in just scrims or officials. Play with them normally and chat often with them to link up a true friendship and that is what makes you indestructible.  7. I quitted competitive myself, because it was too hard for me, and I couldn't handle the 'tryhard' you have to do in competitive. It also might take a long time to find a true team you want to play in, and NEVER underrestimate being a substitute spot, because that might be extremely crucial in some moments.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  8.  TL;DR: Team Fortress 2 is extremely addictive and gives tons of good memories. Best game I've ever played myself.   9. 10/10"

"This simulator perfectly models an active economy. You can trade items of zero functionality for large sums of money. You can also meet tons of friendly individuals who want to 'try on' your hats!  I was also told that there was an easter egg located somewhere that turned this game into an FPS, where you could work as a team and accomplish objectives!"
It's ok.
"First I time came across with TF2 was after I bought an Orange Box from the store, I was dying for HL2. Didn't know it was coming with this cartoon-like game called TF2, and interestingly I almost was going to ask Steam Support to remove this game from my game library after watching a clip on Youtube, seriously, I was like what the £€$$. But was too lazy for that. So time passes, looking to something new, I see this TF2 thingy again in my library, so whatever, let's download and give it a shot.  Now, after a year, I wish I had submitted a ticket to Steam Support and got this thing removed from my account. Clocked 1000+ hours and I don't know where and how this will stop. There are two things you can't apparently clear, one is radioactive contamination the other one being addictive to TF2.  Oh, and supposedly this game came free with Orange Box. Nice play, Valve, first fix is always free, isn't it? Team Fortress 2 Forever."
A game that will leave a mark on the history. 一款会在历史上留下痕迹的游戏
"You can wear a flaming hat and a hat whith electricity, whilst killing people with golden weapons then laugh at them whilst hearts come up from the ground. 10/10"
This was the best game that i have ever played. untill the meat your match update... ♥♥♥♥ all of that
"CSGO has guns skins, TF2 has hats  I like hats more"
"Team Fortress 2 is quite a game with a history. Originally a pay-to-play game, Tf2 became free! Upon so the number of players skyrocketed.  Team Fortress 2 is a game where Reliable Excavation Demolitions (RED) usually defends from onslaughts of Builders Leauge United (BLU). You, the player, are given the choice of 9 merchanaries. The fast, cocky and furious scout, the patriotic brawler soldier, the mysterious hellborn that is the pyro, the scumpy-drinking, one-eyed black cyclops demoman, the comical and brutually large heavy, the whimsical engineer, the funny german medic, the cool, calm and collected sniper and lastly the man who perfers brains over brawn, the spy.  What makes this game so entertaining is that each of the 9 mercanaries that you can play as all have such a distinct personality, looks and playstyle. If you're a player who likes run-and-gun, Scout is for you. If you like big guns, Heavy calls your name. Stealth? Spy is already right behind you, waiting for you to play as him. Who can forget the loveable pyro who sets everything ablaze.  This game is also very rewarding to both new and experienced player alike, as item drops are given not for getting a certain amount of kills, but for just playing the game!  However if you want to truely experience the full greatness that is Tf2 I reccomend paying anywhere from 50 cents to $90 in the Mann Co. Store to get prenium so you can truely have a great feel for the game. However if money is tight or if you're not sure you'll enjoy this amazing game, you are not truely penalized for being a Free-to-Play, unlike most other games of this kind.  Overall Team Fortress 2 is a great game that doesn't require a supercomputer, and I'd honestly reccomend this game to anybody who asks so."
"TF2 a.k.a Team Fortress 2 is a great game in my opinion. It has 9 classes, Pyro, Engineer a.k.a engie, Demoman a.k.a demo, Heavy, Spy, Scout, Medic, Soldier, and Sniper. I liked that the game has lots of diffrent maps so it never gets boring! I recommend this game to anyone who likes animated games and people who also like the game Half Life and Half Life 2."
"This could be the best mmo you will ever face. Its just perfect, every Role is nearly perfect balanced, maybe the Pyro is a bit to strong. Get Items you can sell. A great Community who will not hate you when you are bad, they will just leave you alone."
Thank for 'Meet your Match' update gave a reason to quit tf2
"this is just ♥♥♥♥ing awful, they killed off pubs and the matchmaking is just as bad as the beta volvo pls this isn't csgo and we don't want to be csgo"
You had a bad day?  Too much work? Not much time to play?  Play a match of TF2 for 20-50 mins and refresh your mood.  It's Fun. It's casual. It's entertaining. It's refreshing. Best of ALL? It's FREE.
I'lll come back when pubs come back
"This game had it´s ups and downs with it´s more recent updates that changed the way you played. The meet your match update which completely removed quickplay and introduced casual mode, was the turning point which started it all. The game was unplayable on day one due to the extremely long queue times and the strong possibility of ending up on a match that was already half way over. (Which still is a problem)  However,with the times comes great changes. The last big update of smissmas 2016 was a big step in the right direction. Now you can stay in the same server with all the people on it,as to before where you had to completely leave and find a new server.   However,another big change was the return of the well hated 'Autobalance'. Previously before the Meet your Match update,there was a chance that any player could be automatically be placed on the opposing team when the numbers of team players was unbalanced. This caused some outrage amongs the ones who where autobalanced to the other team,which didn´t help the team in the slightest.  Now with the new Autobalanced system,a player is asked to switch teams with the reward of extra exp. That sounds nice on paper,until you realize how useless exp really is. You get no reward for leveling up,besides a badge which does absolutely nothing. If they really want the autobalance to work,then the whole exp system needs a rework. Why not give the player a new cosmetic item as a reward for leveling up? You could make it untradeable,so the market doesn´t get affected by it.  Overall,the new update improved a lot of flaws that was the new casual mode,but it doesn´t mean that all problems have been resolved yet."
"Oh TF2, oh TF2..  We've come a long way, but everything will end eventually, no matter how fun it was.  If you are looking for the game's details, read the positive reviews, I will have a little rant here.  A few years ago I found this game through the famous 'meet the series', after I started playing I was instantly hooked by the amazing variety of gameplay, even though I do not play anymore do to the reason I will give below I am still active in the community, some of you might know as Gilgamesh from OpenGriefing.    The game:  With the nine classes and huge amount of weapons that come with it TF2 is a game which you can play for days, even months! Each class has their own individual role which is completely unique to it, you can play in all sort of ways, and there is so much to do it rarely feels repeditive. The community is nice, and although most do not appreciate the sight of a new player, there is still a huge amount of nice people. I my self have taught 4 players on how to play TF2 whom I personally don't even know, and I had great fun in doing so, and there more people out there that do the same.  The game has a series of cosmedic items which add a lot of life and color into it. You can dress the big muscle guy called the heavy with his huge machine gun up with a fairy custom, or you can turn the German doctor called the Medic into a WW2 German infantryman of the battle of Stalingrad, these are two examples of thousands of possibilities.  There are many game modes and dozens of maps for each, which let you play the game for an unbelievable amount of time with out getting bored once. These are just the official maps. There are tens-of-thousands of community maps which also enhance the gaming experience.    The community:  TF2 is a very old game, yet it is one of the most played multiplayer games even today. The community is very committed and it was the community that made the game what it is today. Valve kept the game fresh by releasing updates that always added more content with which you could play with your friends and have loads of fun.    With that being said, here comes the problem:  As I said, TF2 has a very committed and loyal community even though the game is from today's standards as old as the bread crumbs that are left in a toaster that one day have the fortune of being vaporized, leaving the toaster as dust.  Now, valve always showed their appreciation for this through out the year by adding fresh content.  This however, has changed.    Valve, like other companies, has noticed the potential of modern competitive games, one genre of which is MOBAs. It is also very obvious that they have grown old of TF2 and want to work on different things. Their plan to keep the game alive, while slowly leaving it was to let their loyal community take over, which I have to say is quite an honorable thing to do.  However, they have completely failed at it.  The problem is, the community may be able to handle parts of the game, but not the entire game it self. It is impossible do to many factors. By this I mean, the community might be able to add content like hats and taunts to the game, but they can not expand the gaming experience, the expanding the gaming experience is exactly what made TF2 a special game, every year there was always something new to try out and after doing that, the normal game was appealing again, and the loop continued. But instead of fixing the issue, they just want to pull it through till the end, like dragging a bleeding body to the hospital but knowing that it won't make it.    Warning Rant:  They also treat the community wrong, they have gotten to used to the community of TF2 treating them like some kind of divine council. They think anything will satisfy it. An example of this is the ♥♥♥♥ing ducks. Some people complained that the 'End of the Line' not including snowplow, with Valves' response being 'It is too complicated for new players', from what I have heard though, the did not include the map due to it not reaching their standards, which is fine by me. Also the lack of weapons that were promised by the creator of the animation did not appear, which was upsetting, but still bearable.  What really shoved the middle finger up my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ though, was the ducks. The ♥♥♥♥ing ducks that cost 5 ♥♥♥♥ING EUROS. FOR ♥♥♥♥ING DUCKS! Is this some sort of joke? Was Valve thinking,'Ayy Lmao, ducks are funny right?' from  Valve and the End of the Line team. Without the ducks, I would have nothing to complain about, but if they seriously think that DUCKS will satisfy their loyal community after they miss out on the promised weapons and a new game mode, then must have ♥♥♥♥ing plumbum in their water supply,  They tried making up to it by rushing 3 new weapons which are all useless and uncreative. The creativity is what counts, not the effectiveness of the weapon.    Pre-access, now for TF2 also!  Another issue is BETA maps, they adapted the method of their platform into TF2. They release unfinished ♥♥♥♥, act like it is finished but still needs 'fixing' and let the community do all the work, instead of actually using already made maps by the community OR getting of their asses and finishing them. The beta map Cactus has a ♥♥♥♥ing holes everywhere! It is also so monotone, I cringe when thinking valve could even put it in the game.    What they appear to think of the community:  They take us for a bunch of clowns, juggling around in the circus with a red nose and wacky hair, riding on a one-wheel making 'toot toot sounds'. They put disclaimers on their ♥♥♥♥! 'For expert players only' they write in captions under their new Pre-Access game mode. Who ever complained to them, that some game modes for too complicated? Someone with 0 neurons in their skull, succeeding at surpassing the stupidity of a pigeon?!? The game mode is just as 'complicated' as the other game modes, there is nothing that could irritate new players, if you exclude all the unnecessary glitches.    Hats:  As it worked in the past, adding more cosmetic items usually was endorsed with a lot of positive responses from the community, this was because they added fun cosmetics, while adding more content for gameplay. It was a balance of a innovation and fun, always the right mix. But now, they just try to make us suffocated in cosmetics.  This can be do to 2 reasons:  1. They just want to add more cosmetics to.. recreate Barbie simulator.  2. They realized that the game is dying and wana milk as much ♥♥♥♥ out of it as they can before it goes downhill (same thing goes for ducks)    Servers:  I will try to keep this short.  Most Valve servers, the servers I personally enjoy playing on the most. Have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BETA maps on them. Most TF2 servers went from TF2 to DOTA 2 and CS:GO.  I remember always finding at least 3 full servers of a single map, for each map a year or two ago. Now I have luck if I find a single full server of a map.    To end this:  As I mentioned before; 'They realized that the game is dying and wanna milk as much ♥♥♥♥ out of it as they can before it goes downhill', the game IS in fact actually going down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Look at all the TF2 youtubers! STAR_ and Jerma have stopped playing the game! Why? Because there is nothing new, and they have a bitter taste because of the recent decisions of Valve regarding TF2. 'So what if two youtubers quit playing the game, it happens all the time.' When a pretty much TF2 only channel with at least 90% of its subscribers being TF2 related, quits the game because the company is ♥♥♥♥ing up, then it is very obvious that there is something wrong!  This is not just YouTube, it is also on my steam friends list, I used to see at least 10 people playing the game at any given time. Now it is rare to see anyone at all play it, and look at the size of that list! With the majority being hardcore TF2 Players.   This game is dying and Valve needs to seriously step in before it bleeds out for good."
It's pretty decent.
One of the best games i've played!
"Team Fortress 2 used to be a good game in like older times, well I stopped playing the game nearly 3 years ago but now it seems to gotten much worse since I stopped. Here's what I don't like about the game:   THE COMMUNITY   This has been a problem since the beginning, and making it free to play (even when I started as a free to play) made it even worse. They expect you to be 100% perfect at the game and if you don't stay up to par with your team, they will blame most things on you, even when you didn't seem to do anything. They also have a chance to make fun of you if you have no hats or taunts or anything, which according to them, if you have no items in the game, you're obviously a bad player, and if you have a backpack filled with rare items and is worth like thousands of dollars, you're automatically considered a pro at the game.  There's the players who are way too good at the game, which ruin the fun by taking all of the kills and making the opposing team scared and, of course, making them rage. Most of the time, someone calls a vote to scramble the teams, or they go into spectate mode and wait 3 hours just so they can join the other team. I honestly think that people are easily enraged by this simple game.   MICROTRANSACTIONS   Another way of slaying people's wallets and life savings. This has become a common thing in many games today, which does include PAYDAY 2 and Killing Floor 2, but I honestly think this game has the most microtransactions. They seem to be almost like getting addicted to a drug, your brain just wants more and more of it, and if you don't get enough, you suffer withdrawl and end up wasting your money on something virtual instead of something better you could buy in real life. I think there's even, for example, a skin for a knife for the Spy costs more than a knife in real life.   GAMEPLAY   I guess the gameplay is what keeps many players involved. The gameplay is not actually that bad, but it's mostly ruined simply by the community. The game is also considered very unbalanced from what I have heard with the new update. Competitive and Casual appear to be very unbalanced, commonly from the opposing team class-stacking (having multiple players play as the same class as one another). The XP system is also dumb, because the only way to get XP from games is by winning, nothing but winning. You get a kill? Nope, no XP for you.  The gameplay may apply with what I said earlier in the community, with how some players are so skilled at the game that they take the fun out of it and make the enemy team scatter. There's no separate servers that are for skilled players only, and there aren't too many assets that indicate a skilled player.  2/10 - Definitely do not recommend playing this game for thousands of hours ... or even hundreds."
Great game lots of fun
"You can not call yourself a person without this game, I mean come on, its free."
"unusuals doesn't make you get better on this game, experiences is"
Really bad after the new update

"  Computer too ♥♥♥♥ to run Overwatch, guess I'll invest some more hours in this game instead."
Better than it's copy-cat bro; CSGO.   Don't buy TF2 keys unless you want to risk it. You'll have a 3% of actually making some profit. (From uncrating.)
"This game is fascinating. I remember I tried playing it a year ago but I sucked ♥♥♥, so I gave up on it, even though I played for about fifteen minutes. I tried it again this year, because I read the reviews and everyone seemed so fascinated, claiming the game ruined your life because it completely consumed you, some people going as far as saying that something as simple as the whole hats deal was addictive. I'd laugh it off, thinking 'It can't be that bad'.  After almost two months of playing, I can confirm; yeah, it's that bad. Perhaps worse.  The first few weeks the liking was soft, I liked the game, the 'Meet the' videos were amusing and really drew me to the game, but I was extremely bad at first, '15 kills, 10 deaths' type of bad. I dominated just one player every two rounds; and I even got really excited when I got a revenge (Jesus, it's embarrassing to admit). That's how bad, and even n00by I was. I was coming back to online PC gaming after six years of sticking to console, so that wasn't helping. But then, when I started playing a little bit more... when it was a domination after domination, when I'd become friends with my pocket Medics or the people I was a pocket Medic to... Life changed. This game literally consumed me. I wanted to use a portion of my birthday money to buy myself some cosmetics *just* for my Medic, make him beautiful ya'kno, and I ended up spending all of it in cosmetics for many of the classes. I'd stay up extremely late at night playing, sleep little, to then wake up early to play again. Now it's gotten to the point in which I've played 12 hours straight of TF2 with little rest in-between, two days ago it was *fourteen* hours. With a lot of effort I got up my ♥♥♥♥ to work out today just to not be too sedentary, and it was exasperating because I wanted to play. The game's just special like that, ya'know? It's fun. It's unique, creative. And I love the small details like the angry faces the classes make when they're shooting or fighting, the happy faces on the partner-taunts, the faces of agony when they're with low health; details like that make it special. And it's just generally very addictive.  My point? This game is f*cking terrible. I don't give a cr*p if it's free, DON'T INSTALL IT. IT WILL CONSUME YOU AND RUIN YOU. F*CKING RUN. RUN WHILE YOU STILL CAN!!!!!!!! (I still recommend it, though. Just because you'll have a lot of fun)  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll get back to playing."
"bought this hat simulator back in late 08 early 09, i dont ♥♥♥♥ing know, the game's been good since, aka Hat Fortress 2: Hat fortress harder."
"Have you ever had the craving to buy a strange weapon then spend all day leveling it up so your friends think you are cool? Then this is the best game for you! First job, get a strange either by wasting your money on uncrating, crafting all your hard found weapons to buy a strange from the overpriced scumbags on Tf2.Outpost, or better yet be a scumbag yourself and scam a newcomer who has just had this misfortune to uncrate and give him/her a scrap for his/her recently unboxed strange. Step two, locate a strange level up sever don't worry they are very easy to find due to the sheer amount of people wanting to level up their stranges so badly. And final step go and kill some idle people on the strange level up sever. Now all your friends/eniemes will think next time you kill them WOW they got 16854972 kills in one day? Defiently didn't go on a strange level up sever.  10/10 Best game"
"Lets go over the recent changes.  &gt; Hats no longer drop &gt; Crates drop more than weapons themselves do &gt; Pubs pretty much gutted, now Competative through-out  Everyone who bought this game before F2P knew it was downhill from that point on. The slippery slope is real."
Being an old school player of the Fortress genre I have completely fell in love with the way TeamFortress2 handles now.   I was here during beta / Launch and experienced the first year and realized it was good but needed more time. I took 5 yrs away came back and the game is 100% amazing and probably one of the best Free 2 Play games out!  CPU specs can be sub par and still playable and the overall community is generally nice/ friendly.

Ruined My Life. 5 Stars.
Great F2P game.  I have had alot of fun playing this game over the years. I believe I first played on xbox when The Orange Box came out. That was stolen before I could really enjoy much since I was moving and someone broke into my storage. I started playing on Steam once I got back into playing PC games and saw it was f2p. I did end up getting a copy of The Orange Box on here which made trading in-game items available as well as selling the market for some things.  I really enjoy the big events like Halloween and how they have special maps and items every year. The last few years new event items have not been tradable which kind of sucks since they were lots of fun for trading and selling to get cooler things or things you couldn't seem to get no matter how much you played.  I definitely recommend playing and buying something cheap in-game to unlock trading and selling items.  The game is like a cartoonish Counter-Strike and so much fun is to be had especially with friends and good strangers.
10/10  got attacked by a hoard of spies and they all fell in a hole and died
"Get it, love it."
Its simply the best
"this game is one of the best games i have ever played i love it i love the updates, maps, cosmetics, basically almost everything about the game is awsome well there are some things i dislike but besides all that best game ever keep up the good work."
- Bird headed mercs  - Conga everywhere  - Hats  I've seen enough to know that nobody's wallet can escape now.
"Made me get excited over bread, making me feel like I have a life.   This is one of the best games that is out there.   The glorious cartoon style, the unique classes with different traits, the thousand of weapons and hats that can be bestowed in your hands.  And let's not forget the mods that people have given us.   Deathrun, Jailbreak, Saxton Hale, even a god damn carnival.   This is quite an amazing game, I simply  adore  it.  From the  millions of items  that are in the game, even if you still just dont want to play,  you can always switch to trading and pick up some nice items that can make yourself a king to the throne.    I believe that Team Fortress 2 is one of the best games that I know in love.   For christ's sake, you can even throw  PEE , cut off peoples heads with swords, eat chocolate, a sandwich, and a fishcake in the heat of battle.  Go invisible, launch pills at people, kill somebody with an imaginary hand. I'm serious,  YOUR OWN HAND, WITHOUT EVEN USING IT TO FISTFIGHT.   I love this game, call it a  hattropolis or a money-waster   (which it sort of is)     It has a unique style, beautiful animations, a great community and plenty of things to do.     I believe that this should get a little more respect for the game that it is. "
I have an UNUSUAL obsession with this game.
Re-reveiwing this game sadly this game seems to have gone downhill i just can't have that much fun with this game anymore this game is too focused on being what it isint and has lost its charm to me hate me if ya want but this is just my personal opinion on what this game has become so its been fun but i don't know if you'll ever be the fun f2p fps you used to be
"Team Fortress 2 is a side scrolling platformer from the mid eighties that stars an over zealous racially stereotypical Italian plumber out to save his monster aphrodisiac princess/lover/doubles partner. Using the power of the Thu'um you must defeat Alduin the Dragon and bring peace to the land. The portal gun is your only defence against waves of incoming undead. Boasting game modes like Prop Hunt, Dark RP and Trouble In Terrorist Town a variety induced coma will likely ensue.  'It's like Die Hard in space!' - Alex 'Take Damage Ever, Please' Memories 2014  'I am a silly goos' - Chainz the goos 2014  'Team Fortress 2 is amazing, but i hate those gosh darn pyro's' - Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill 1952"
"What is with the new update. It ruined everything, no more online server. And it takes forever to load a normal server NORMAL SERVER. It takes as long as mvm does."
yep its very good
My favorite game! Such well planned characteristics and weapons for classes.
"Well, I used to love TF2... but this new update is ♥♥♥♥... Some people have been waiting 2 hours just to play a casual game... oh AND theres penalty's for leaving now! Please give us back the old TF2."
"Dont get me wrong.. This is great game if youre lookin for FPS f2p game to play with your friends.. Its really fun and sht BUT! There are just small details thats bothering me and this HUGE update that came out today.. Ive been waiting so long, patiently watching incoming updates, changes, but this last update was also last nail in coffin called team fortress 2 (atleast for me). Only thing you can do now.. is funeral...   Small details such as dsync.. terrible feedback.. literally useless weapons, weapon skins that looks like pure sht.. I could continue but if youre new to the game you probably wont register.   Now this Meet your match update. It is possible to be changed in future but right now its forcing you to play random map and random mod with ofc random people and since everyone is unranked you can get players with hunderts.. even thousands hours with players with barelly 10h gameplay wich according to volvo is same 'skill' as you..  Also youll get XP just for win and win only. Got bunch of kills? Doesnt matter. Valuable medic? Doesnt matter. You were only one with your friend who actually did something in game? Doesnt matter, you wont get sht. So far, nobody is takin it seriously.. Just few people..   long story short: if you want to play this for fun.. its great. But if you will try to take this game seriously, you will fail, in csgo you can atleast filter wich maps you want to join in compet okay.. but not here...   yeah and no pubs.. so i guess im done with this game.. shame.. i really liked it..   Edit: i was reading some reviews from this date.. and honestly its making me so sad that dedicated fans with thousands of hours literally.. are just leaving.."
"I've been playing this game for six years on and off. It was awesome in the beginning, the community was nice, the gameplay was entertaining. Now, with Meet your Match, if you get stuck on the one team that is losing, may whatever deity you worship have mercy on your soul because you can't switch teams anymore.  Balanced teams happen once in a blue moon, classes and weapons are getting buffed/nerfed at random for reasons only Valve knows, the only new content being added is made by the community (in some rare occasions by Valve and when it is it seems to be pretty terrible, just look at the Carlton taunt, no music! They made music for the conga, the kazotsky kick and the mannrobics, why can't they make a new song for the Carlton taunt ? Do you have any idea how awkward it is to dance without music ?), new weapons happen once every few years and the community's become stressed, displeased, tired and demotivated.  If you want a game where fun is the main element, TF2 is definetly not the War-themed hat simulator you're looking for (unless you're the kind of person who enjoys ruining another's day for their own enjoyment).  My opinion about this game will remain the same until Valve actually does anything good for the community and the game."
"Well, I used to love TF2... but this new update is ♥♥♥♥... Some people have been waiting 2 hours just to play a casual game... oh AND theres penalty's for leaving now! Please give us back the old TF2."
"Dont get me wrong.. This is great game if youre lookin for FPS f2p game to play with your friends.. Its really fun and sht BUT! There are just small details thats bothering me and this HUGE update that came out today.. Ive been waiting so long, patiently watching incoming updates, changes, but this last update was also last nail in coffin called team fortress 2 (atleast for me). Only thing you can do now.. is funeral...   Small details such as dsync.. terrible feedback.. literally useless weapons, weapon skins that looks like pure sht.. I could continue but if youre new to the game you probably wont register.   Now this Meet your match update. It is possible to be changed in future but right now its forcing you to play random map and random mod with ofc random people and since everyone is unranked you can get players with hunderts.. even thousands hours with players with barelly 10h gameplay wich according to volvo is same 'skill' as you..

"Team Fortresss 2 is a great firstperson multiplayer shooter with 9 different classes to play as. They all have a playstyle for themselfs, and unique in their way. There is a lot to learn, from the many different playstyles, and how you play the classes.  I've spent a lot of hours on this game, yet I'm not even close to stop playing. Got lots of friends to play with in it, and still as charming as when I started to play it!"
This game is so crap you can't stop playing it.
"Great game. There are quite a few glitches after big updates, but its still a good game. This game ruins people, these hats ruin people. I recommend any new person coming into tf2 to NOT focus on hats or the economy, most of you will and you WILL REGRET it. Just trust me, there is way to much price manipulation going on. And if you do get into hats DO NOT get into unusuals. They will make you question everything you've ever done. Just dont do it. Dont go to the hat side. Anyways, just based on the game (not hats) i'll give this game a 10/10 will swag again."
"This game has hat. If your game doesn't have hat, then your game is crap.  76/76 woul waste 200€ to buy virtual hats again. 42/42 would waste another 200€ to give them custom names again. 25/25 would waste ANOTHER 200€ to change their colour again. 9/11 would waste YET ANOTHER F*CKING 200€ TO BUY TOTALLY USELESS VIRTUAL CRAP AGAIN.  This game stole my wallet. It's still worth playing and it's free but BEWARE: THERE'S A 76% CHANCE YOU WILL GET ADDICTED WICH MAKES YOU WANT TO BUY MORE AND MORE HATS. THIS GAME MAY BE FREE TO PLAY BUT TRUST ME, GABEN WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY AND ALL YOU GET WILL BE VIRTUAL HATS.  Also, the community is ok... I guess."
"Much hats, many wow. :3"
"I used to love this game. The new update ruined it, I will edit this review when it is changed back.  #MakeTF2GreatAgain"
"It's a decade old game and it used to be a pretty good one. For some years however, whatever team is working on the game currently is unfamiliar with it and have poor judgement in the direction, balance, and essence of the game."
"This game is no more a hat simulator, it is a loading screen simulator."
"I have played tf2 for over 2 years. It was my best game. Now, everything changed. This stupid update ruined tf2. Now tf2 have ranking systems which sucks. Now you cant join into a map you want. Now you have to wait to search matches. Awful just awful. Valve please stop it! Remove the freaking update, or we will start riot. You make guns even worse!  2/10 Just very bad."
Wasted more then 150h of my life on this game already  10/10 would waste again
"2000+ hours youll never get back, yet youll never regret it"
This new update is horrible!!! You must wait a lot of time for a match.
" World's greatest war-themed hat simulator.   This is going to sound dramatic, and maybe it is, but this is how I feel right now.  TF2. Six years of my life have been spent with this game, and right now I'm mourning its loss. No overpriced Valve emoticon can adequately capture the raw sadness I'm feeling at this moment. I really want to recommend this game. I really, really do... but I just can't. If you asked me in 2011 and 2012, I'd say that TF2 is an absolutely brilliant, amazing, and fun game. In 2013 I'd say the same but with less enthusiasm. In 2014 I might hesitate a bit before giving that answer.  Over these past few years, I've watched the game slowly deteriorate from Valve's laziness, ineptitude, and just poor decisions. Community servers are what made TF2 great. They're why I stuck with this game. Without community servers, TF2 is just another in a very long line of objective-based first-person shooters. Community servers are where you meet people. They're where you make lasting connections. They're where you fill up your Steam friends list. And now? They're gone. Deserted.  As I'm typing this, TF2 is in the middle of its biggest event of the year: Scream Fortress. At this exact moment, TF2 has only 6x more players than Counter-Strike 1.6. CS 1.6 is from an era where Valve built games to last. CS 1.6 has no Valve servers. It has no matchmaking. It has no hats or microtransactions. It just has its community. A community which is desperately clinging to a 16-year-old game and is doing pretty damn well for itself.  TF2's community is long gone. All the YouTubers have moved on. I found exactly one populated server tonight running plr_hightower_event, one of the most popular Halloween maps, and it had fast respawn enabled.  Community servers are what made TF2 great back in the early days. They're what primed TF2 to go free-to-play. Valve servers were only added back then to handle the big surge of new players in the Uber Update. If you asked a 'TF2 player' back then of their opinion of Valve servers, they would scoff down their nose at you.  I poured my heart and soul into this game. I spent countless hours building server plugins which were at one point running on thousands of TF2 servers worldwide. That drive is now gone because TF2 just doesn't offer anything to me anymore. I really, really want it to, but it doesn't. I would give nearly anything to get the old TF2 back.  TF2's community is gone, and I'm just devastated.  TF2 is gone.  I want it back, but I'm afraid that at this point, it's too late."
Just isn't what it used to be.
I love it!

"The new update is ♥♥♥♥ , i will uninstal tf2 even i installed it the same day i uninstalled it . ♥♥♥♥ competative , ♥♥♥♥ tf.go . This game is aids. The leveling system is aids. I hope you get aids . And goodbye.  Also valve thx for ♥♥♥♥ing this game . I will never play it."
The most fun I've ever had in a game. 6 years playing and it's still not getting old.
"It was a fun game, but the Meet Your Match update ♥♥♥♥ this up."
I do like competitive but I don't like valve's idea of it.  I also don't like how they ♥♥♥♥ed over the majority of their playerbase with removing quickplay and introducing casual servers.
give me items 4 this game or i wil ban u
"Hey, have you heard of this game 'Dream For Dress 2'.It's all about going to class and dressing up. It's great."
Wasted a large portion of my life on it. 10/10
"This new update was very disapointing and sometimes confusing I'm not saying it's the worst update but it's not the best. So many gamers were so hyped for this new update but now it feels like a slap in the face. I like the original layout way better (The one with quickplay),but if they manage to bring back the old layout then I recommend this game. TF2 is a really fun game that all gamers must try, but this update is just a slap in the face"
"Listen am not much of a reviewer, so i can only say so much about a game but *flips table* this game is freaken amazing! i wish i never stopped playing it or got rid of my items. HOURS maybe YEARS of replay ability. the game modes that come with it are fun and great moding community. easly first PC game you should play if your a FPS fan."
"After 5k Hours this is my experenice:  -Kill people while wearing hats and taunting them afterwards to make them ragequit. -Buy more hats. -Trade hats. -Friendlies :). -Use a specific paint and recolor all your cosmetics with it. -Kill Robots in MvM(with ticket) and maybe get guns with robohead attached to them or a Goldengun. -Community is picky and split into differend 'kinds' of people. -Valvetime. -'Thanks and have fun'. -Randomcritz are fair and balanced. -NEVER trust friendly spycrabs. -'Can we get new weapons ?... plz..?'. -Pootis. -( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) -Demoman takes skill. -w+m1 Pyro takes skill. -Heavy mains don't exist. -Micspamm. -Textbinds and scriptkiddies. -Tradeserver's but everyone is AFK. -Donald Trump is the 10th Class confirmed. -Cuntsmen -Blutsauger = Pubs/MvM, Crossbow= Comp, Playing with Friends, Everything else. -Lime Scout   Medic   mains.  -Gaben@valvesoftware.com  -Minigun&gt;Tomislav&gt;All other Miniguns- -Stock Medigun&gt;Kritz&gt;Quickfix&gt;VACSHIT(Kys if you main this medigun). -Australiums&gt;Festives&gt;Stock -Dress up as your favorite Youtuber or wear just a hat/part of the loadout and get 'YOU CAN'T WEAR THIS HAT BECAUSE A YOUTUBER WEARS THISSSXD' Response. -rd_asteroid is the best map and valve should release it already out of beta along with kektus. -Although Pubs are gone and Casual is really nice nowadays i still want a option to play in Pubs. -Optimize the Serverbrowser. -Memes!!! -MORE MEMEES!!! -But i don't like memes. -( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°) "
"it is an awesome game, but players mostly kids have to understand it is not a donation center"
"Got this game in 2008 on 'The Orange Box'. Sometimes, you will play for the entire week of how this game is/was awesome playing. Then you'll start to be bored of the current gamemodes/maps you have already played. You'll get that long break, after some months, you will start to play the game again.  It's a fun FPS, still popular, gets good updates from Valve and be sure to always invite your friends to play with you; the good part of this game that is free!  9.5/10"
Hat Simulator of the year all years
  This game is better than sex  
Awesome Game! Completely free to play but you can get a ton of hats if you go premium! TF2 is a pretty balanced game too. Definitely recommend this game ^^
"Game's good, the forums are full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ though"
"This, Is the End Of The Line Update. (Well done on destroying this game)"
Great game with a horrible community.

hats?
You're just BEGGING us to play Overwatch!
"I can not recommend this game enough! I've played it for a really long time, and it has never even once become boring.  There may not be many updates to it, and it's glitchy as hell, AND the developers don't care about it as much anymore than they used to, it still is an incredibly fun game that you can just jump in any time you want.  It might be a bit hard to get in due to all of the different weapons, classes, stats and what not (tons of stuff to remember), but once you got into it, oh man.  The community isn't that bad, either. Had worse experiences in Dota 2... *shivers*"
"EDIT: To all the people who are complaining about the new update, you wanted a new update, you got it. So what, a couple of skins, some crates, and some fresh gameplay mechanics, big deal. Leave your negative reviews to yourself, no one cares. =================================================================== Team Fortress 2, here I go. Looking for a game that's free to play, a first person shooter, and down right fun as hell? Well, you've come to the right game! All 9 classes add for a diverse choice of playing styles, but that's only part of it. Weapons, lots of extra weapons. The large universe of weapons can assist you in your play style or just change it completely  (I'm looking at you, gunslinger) . The large selection of weapons allow for a diverse and quite unique experience for the first person shooter genre, and there's still not something that can match up to this game. But, the main reason most people play Team Fortress 2 is for it's 1 of a kind trading system. While is is sometimes unrelliable, trade servers and all, Team Fortress's 2 trading system is a game changer. You can trade hats, miscs, and weapons, and trust me, you're better off having hats, because in this game, your generally considered  'a better player'  for having loads of hats and unusuals. Ah! Unusuals, almost forgot about those things. Unusuals are basically hats with special effects like flames or a snow cloud over your head or on your head. They are obtained through purchasing Mann Co. Supply Crate Keys  (and many more types of keys)  from the Mann. Co Store or the Steam Market or other sources, and using them to unbox a crate that corresponds with that specific key, generally reffered to unboxing or un-crating. Players have a very rare chance to unbox these 'Unusuals', but when you do, consider yourself 'Done with trading'  (unless you unbox a less valuable unusual) . That's Team Fortress 2 in a LONG Nutshell.  I'm SuperOnlineGamer, and I approve of this game! "
"Team Fortress 2 is the pinnacle of artistic expression in video games. I can think of no better artistic representation of the failure man has made out of civilization than the Heavy Weapons Guy. Think about it for a second. He's morbidly obese, a communist, and requires no natural ability to use effectively. I also like how the most-fragile class, the Spy, is French. Highly recommended"
It's Great!
Play it for fun! its Free to play!
"I love this game so much that 7 years after its launch, I spent over 3 months of sweat and first-world hard labor to put together a love letter in video form:   'Why Team Fortress 2 is STILL my favorite FPS in 2015'"
I entered server Played as Medic Healed Heavy And he said 'REALY THANKS!'
"I actually palyed in other steam ID, so real playtime is 500+. I enjoyed the game basically. Fun and Simple. But in this update, why I can't go out server without penalty even it is not competitive? I think it is silly and disappointing. And I can't even find a match.  TF2 is an classic nice game but why you make this kind of change? Please be simple and light again.  OMG. I can't find a Casual match. I can't play the game freely. It is a real regression. It is hard to believe. One of my best game is now broken. Please comeback TF2.  July 9, They removed abondone penalty. Good progression. Still it would be better if matchmakingtime be shorter or improving replacement.  I can't find server and play the game. I wasted my 30 minutes with finding server."
pretty cool &amp; soO awesome ;p
After playing this game I went out to some stores and spend all my life savings on hats and now I spend my life running around asking people if they want to trade hats.
"TF2 used to have charm. It used to be great. With the matchmaking update, it's just a bad clone of overwatch."
"  Click me for live review  Hats, hats, hats.  Robots, robots, robots.  Stab, stab, stab.  Burn,burn,burn.  "
"Best Online Shooter, Unstoppable Juggernaut, Hats! Take my money."
  Finding 'quick play' casual games takes upwards to 45 mins+   If you leave casual games you get an abandon penalty.   Can't choose what maps you want to play anymore   Game still runs like ♥♥♥♥ on modern PC's with high end hardware without configs   On the plus side 'Neato' is now a new meme. Thanks valve!

"Exploit fortress 2! Still the best game ive seen, playing it since 2007. Here is alot of fun mods on a community servers, nice casual on official servers, pretty cool competitive 6x6. Only in this game you can meet: Pootis army, spycrabs, sentry gun in textures, ♥♥♥♥♥ cupcake, engineer on skybox, brutal christian sniper, underground heavy, demopan and other fun characters. :D So, what are you waiting for?!"
"I love this game. I may not have thousands of hours like some people, or a dozen unusual australium weapons, but i got rather good at it in my time playing. I put up with a lot of ♥♥♥♥, Broken comp, broken weapons, no new content for like a ♥♥♥♥ing year, ect. But then they took away valve servers. That is where the fun for me was. Going into a random game, picking the team that is losing, then tryharding pubstomping until we where winning. That's where the fun in the game was for me. Now, that is gone. For all it's faults, it's far from a bad game. But i don't like sitting around and waiting for 10 mins for a 4 min match."
Simply Amazing multiplayer game.. with hats
The valve pub servers were the only thing keeping me from leaving TF2  Now even those are gone
Rest in peace my good'ol friend
"Killed my social life, along with my inancial life, to collect hats with things coming out of them 10/10, would reccomend to friends and family"
"My Review used to be for this game, a very positive one, that talked about how this game can fit 'any type of gamer' and 'has just the right amount of weirdness for everyone'. While I wish that was still as true as it was, TF2 now a days is just a old shell of its formel self. I can't even get into a party with all of my friends anymore, never the less find a game and have as much fun as we all used to. I just wish Valve cared as much as they used to. I have spent over $200 on this game, putting hundreds of hours into training to become better at the game, even making my own Australium Scattergun from the game. But it seems like all of this has been lost, from the loss of the community, loss of effort in recent updates, and loss of my positive review. Until the game is rightfully fixed, I can't give it a thumbs up."
"Valve adding in the casual matchmaking was something they must have thought was good on paper. Unfortunately it didn't work out. Tf2 was a simple fps you can download and find a game easy peasy. Now the fact that you have to wait for a match at all is unpleasent. Its like if Little Ceaser's pizza only accepts reservations for their pizza. You liked them because of how easy it was to get what you want. Saying, 'oh just go to a local/ community pizza place, you dont have to just use that place.' doesn't help the fact that most of the community just wanted to play a game without having to wait. Honestly Valve should have just added Competative and leave it be. Honestly, its best to just wait until top players complain as well about the update because valve will only listen to the voices that are more important."
"Team Fortress 2 is a fantastic multi-player online first person shooter with 9 classes that all have unique personalities. Each class uses a primary, secondary and melee weapon.  The Heavy has the most health, takes a while to fire, but can do the most damage per second with no reloading, but he moves slowly. The soldier shoots rockets, has the 2nd most health and and is the 2nd slowest, but experienced players can rocket jump. The demoman is a defender, using stickybombs to lay traps and grenades to roll forward, he can sticky jump with some practice and can also be a proficient melee class. The Pyro is a defender, lighting enemies on fire, causing damage for an amount of time, air blasting projectiles away and bringing good cheer and derpiness to any team. Engineers build teleporters, sentry guns and dispensers to defend the team and keep them healthy and supplied with ammo. The spy is elusive and backstabs people while invisible cloaking or disguising himself. His sapper can also disable and destroy the engineer's buildings. The scout runs fast with a double jump and shotguns people, he also captures at twice the speed of anyone else. Snipers snipe from far away. Medics heal and make people invincible at times.   As for the modes, there are traditional capture the flag, king of the hill and less traditional payload, where blue team will push a moving cart, while red team defends it. The more blue players next to the cart, the faster it will go. If a red player is next to the cart, it stops moving. It is a great dynamic that makes the game really stand out above the rest. There is also payload race, where two teams push their carts, and control points where the goal is to capture all of the points (3 or 5 points instead of just 1 like King of the Hill). Teams for both modes are mostly 12 vs 12. Each mode has quite a few maps and maps are continually added over time.  The newest mode is Mann vs Machine, where six players take on wave after wave of robots. There is a free version of Mann vs Machine called Boot Camp and a non free version called Mann Up that costs a Tour of Duty Ticket ($1 in the store). The ticket gets used if you complete a MVM mission. If you don't complete a mission, or if you complete a mission you've already completed, then you keep the ticket. A Mann vs Machine tour is composed of several missions across a few maps. What do you get for completing a tour? A random strange weapon and a notch in your belt!  The maps in Team Fortress 2 stand out for their paths, there isn't just one path through each map, but there are usually several routes to get around a herd of foes. There is a lot of joy and satisfaction flanking opponents and killing an entire team from behind.  Sure this game is free to play, but there are a lot of things to buy for real money! Hats for $5, keys for $2.50. Keys are like legalized gambling, you buy a key to open a crate, if you don't get what you want, you can always use Steam trade to trade the item for something you do want or just use another key! There is a whole micro economy in the game with trading. The game will drop you weapons as you play, then you can craft two weapons together to make metal. 18 weapons will make you a refined metal. That's the basic free currency of the game. When you have three refine, you can craft them together for a random hat. Most people prefer to trade their refined for keys, but well refined metal will always generate from dropped weapons, keys will always cost $2.50. You can also buy and sell keys in the Steam market for Steam wallet money to buy Steam games.  The items you pay for are cosmetic if not strange weapons that count your kills. So it is not pay to win, even though you can buy in game weapons, but every weapon is a side-grade, not an upgrade, with pros and cons to each weapon. Since this is a multi-player game, nothing will overpower you. It is all rock-paper-scissors. Heavy can kill anything, but a spy or sniper can take out a heavy. A pyro can easily take out a spy. Stuff like that.  Team Fortress 2 is updated regularly and has implemented a lot of community created items, maps and Halloween events. The Halloween events feel pretty special, but for the most part, they're just Halloween versions of normal maps. The community items, while cool, seem to be mostly cosmetic items with a few new weapons. There have been community maps made and maps are always free to play on.  It is an exceptional game. Diverse weapons, maps and it is buckets of fun and free to play!!!! FREE!!! You get weapons dropped to you over time or you can trade them. It is such a good game even if you're like me and hate multiplayer this is fun multiplayer! Or single player against bots! It is a must play for any fan of first person shooters. The game is smooth, the 9 characters and weapons are very balanced and very different. There is a diverse array of modes."
"Well,Team Fortress 2 is definitely unique FPS on market. With magnificent voice acting and animation Valve managed to put soul and personality in classes of TF2. Classes are divided in 3 groups ( offensive, defensive and support), easy to play but difficult to master. It really doesn't matter if you are completely new to FPS or avid gamer, from it's wide variety of game modes Team Fortress 2 offers something for everybody. Game is free to play so give it a try. ;)"
"Dont get me wrong, I love, or rather loved this game. But since the new update, its unplayable.  •You get penalties if you leave a casual match •The item servers are down •I cant even find a server to play on •You cant even choose the valve server you are joining or even the exact game mode you want to play.  I feel restricted to play the game the way I liked it, and this just pisses me off. While Im sure that they'll fix the problems with the Item and matchmaking servers soon, I dont feel like recommending the game until they make the game like it was before, without penalties for leaving a CASUAL match."
Meet Your Match update = RIP Tf2
"This game can be played both casually or competitively, as an ex-comp player, trader, coach for newer teams, and the all round pub stomper, I can say that this game has taken up a lot of my free time. Learning each class is a new experience and opens up another dimension to the game in which you have never seen before.   A few examples are medic, which showed me how important heals were in a game; soldier, which opened my eyes to the sky and any place up high; scout, for his mobility and how easy it was to get around.   Those are just some of the reasons why you should play this, it immerses you in a rapidly changing environment where you have to change yourself to improve mid-game.  -- Edit -- The new casual matchmaking system has allowed for quicker games. It has brought together the worse players so that they can learn from the pros by playing alongside them. The community servers used to house closed communities of people, but now it is one big community of general TF2 players connecting across the world! The stronger communities like surf, jump and mge still stands, however now there are less trolls and people tend to only go there if they want to actually play it.  The competitive matchmaking however can be given a boost. Not a lot of people play it as it can be horribly unbalanced. A good team of 6 can easily beat any mismatch of 6 solo queuers."
"I can honestly say, this is one of the best games i have ever played, i have been playing for 3 years now, and i have yet to get bored, it seems there are always new things, not only does it have a great weapon system and diffrent uses fir diffrent weapons, it has a beutifal customization system, hats miscs, its amazing, and it has a personality for each class and i love it, not to mention it has that classic game sort of feel, it brings health packs into the game, a use for each class, i really recomend this game to people who are tired of call of duty, and battle field, not trying to say that those two are bad, i played them, but it reapeated, nothing much new, so if you are looking for a good game, i higly recommend this =)"
I would complete this review but even after the hundreds of hours spent I still have not completed the campaign by getting my burning team captain.
"It's sad to see legends fall...  At it's current state, No.   *EDIT*  It's fine now, Normal gamemodes are still garbage and takes over 5 mins to find a poorly balanced match. You can still play the community servers which are extremely fun and I recommend you do it."
This game use to be so much better...
Game is ruined
wHY THE HELL AM I NOT ABLE TO PLAY? 
"This is the game that got me into PC Gaming. I played cereal box doom reskins/point and click, and flash games before but TF2 was my first real PC game that got me into Steam and everything else PC. I found the boxed version, back when you had to pay for it, on my friends floor and he gave it to me because it didn't work for his Mac at the time. Hence the key activation tag up in the top right^ if you're viewing this on the store page.  I started playing back in 2011 and got sucked into the trading scene. There's been a lot of changes but it will always have me coming back. There's nothing that's comparable for me, it will always be my favorite game.  ♥"
Game is ruined
wHY THE HELL AM I NOT ABLE TO PLAY? 
*saw TF2 is 75% discount on sale* *TF2 is free 2 play* *bought it for free on 75% discount*  10/10 would buy a free discount F2P again.
"Keyless crates? A crate series that adds a pile of stranges, most of which we already had? No quickplay and some rediculous queue times reminiscent of the queue times for instances for the first few weeks of each ex. pack in wow? As much as I love this game, I don't really recommend it for newer players. One thing that I really wish valve would do is make some sort of system in which lower ranked players will play other lower ranked players in comp mode and vice versa for higher ranked player.       No new hats to go along with the update? Mayflower doesn't count..."
Played this game for 2600+ hours. I'm still trash at the game   10/1 would play again
"Sell your unusuals, cashout your keys, uninstall and forget this game ever existed."
This game killed my social life.  I don't regret it.
"Two Types of People Before the Downdate - 'This is going to be sick! Please add Volvo' - 'This will be a disaster. TF2 is mostly casual, it doesn't make any sense why thewy would add this.' After the Downdate, Both Parties Were Forced Into the Melting Pot - 'Matchmaking takes forever and I just want to play in pub servers. Revert the update!'         I kinda agree."
It was fun while it lasted but now there is 2 fuc**** competirve modes
Team Fortress 2 has to be one of my favorite hat simulators of all time I wasted way over 100$ on this simulator Help me please
"Mechanics are still godly compared to the other games around, but the game itself should go back to its state before those recent updates."
"Best f2p I've ever played (and best I'm ever going to play probably).   First of all it's very fun: great gameplay, funny characters, awesome community made items... perfect to play with friends. It's really skill-based and has also some good teamplay elements too.  One of the best thing about it is also that it's a very balanced game (the classes are, the player distribution in teams never is, even after 84567 'scrambling the teams'): the class you select is always gonna have a lot of pros and cons, be effective against some classes and be an easy target for others.  After some time you'll probably end up having  favorite classes and some that you like... a bit less :D  [i.imgur.com]  (f**king spies !)   There's an inner story to the game and it's characters, but as often with Valve is not really explicit, actually even less than Portal or L4D2. So take a look at the  comics  [www.teamfortress.com]  to know more about it !   After 9 years in development, it's been worth the wait !   "
"This game is truely awesome. I got nothing to say, oh wait, sometimes the boos that you can hear when you lose can be a tiny irritating when you realize you did great but the others failed. However you have a load of community mods like Death Run that can increase your TF2 experience and making you having fun without raging at your enemies.  → 95/100"
"The game itself: For the current new update of casual i am not mutch of a fan. The casual play system is not what I personally like due the level system and the waiting time to join in the fun. Back in the day you could just instant join a casual play and there was a more relaxed atmosphere. Now most people only wish to see what rank you are and what not. This why i most prefer trade servers due you get to see a different side of the TF2 community. Its more relaxed and you can do almost whatever you want. Trading, Farming, Socialize, Duels you name it. This why I would be mostly found here of the relaxed atmosphere.  Personally: I have played this game now for a few good years, and it will always be a great game. because of the people you meet here are interesting and the situations are always different. The game may be somewhat the same. But the people that play it are always different. And that’s what i like to socialize and meet new people. And to see how a story unfolds."
"Once you start, you just can't stop. Never before have hats had more meaning in my life."
"I've been playing this game for a few years now i've found wonderfull people, i've had amazing and memorable times playing on Pub's, Casual Servers, Slack off and idle Servers just being dumb and having a relaxing afternoon play, i've also played this game seriusly, like sweating blood seriusly, like i wanted to be a recognized Competetive player, and i even got accepted at a fake-wannabe UGC server having intense and just dizzing matches.  i've stand so many Update bullcrap over the years  but Meet your Match....man...  it was fun at the beggining where you could STILL PLAY PUBLIC SERVERS, the COMPETITIVE MODE WAS A MODE, AND I COULD CHOOSE THE GODAMN MAP I WANTED TO PLAY. choosing the freaking map you want to play! that's asking much? and now i have to wait atleast 10 minutes to play something i am assigned, with completely broken matching, i never thought i'd miss Autobalancing jesus...  scince i moved my internet got worse, but i could still play fairly well on Pub servers and great on Idle/Trade servers  now, i'm always laggy on 'Casual Mode' i can't play well, or feel any fun because everything is blinking and just stopping every 2 seconds PLUS a horrible, horrible delay of a second or two, i can't play basically nothing without just being terrible,the weapon balance is hideous, non-sensical and just absurd! it's not fun anymore.  I've been playing for 3 years now, i can't belive i'm about to quit because a horrible update, this was my favorite game of ALL time, i've never played nothing for this long, 3,000 hours of fun will just go right down the toilet.  Staff at Valve, keep your stupid Competitive Mode if you want, i want my Public servers back."
" Team Fortress 2  aka  TF2  is a 'Free to Play', Multiplayer, First Person Shooter (FPS), and a Hat (Cosmetic) Simulator.  A very fun game. Especially, very addictive and good for relaxation, but it depends how good you are at the game or on your picked class.   Classes &amp; Teams:   There're about 9 classes in the  TF2 : [Offensive Classes:] Scout, Soldier, Pyro, [Defensive Classes:] Demoman, Heavy (Weapons Guy), Engineer, [Support Classes:] Medic, Sniper and Spy. Each class has it's own strength and weakness. For example, Spy has a low health, but he can kill can instantly by backstabbing you. TF2 has 2 teams: BLU and RED. They hate each other, and they attack each other. Nothing interesting.   Maps (Levels) &amp; Gamemodes:  Maps can be different (pretty obvious). But unfortunately, maps can affect the gameplay, because like I said before, each class has it's own weakness. For example, Sniper can kill you pretty easily in a very wide map, and you can get annoyed.  Each map has it's own gamemode. Here is a list of all  official  gamemodes:  Capture the Flag (ctf)   Control Points (cp)   Territorial Control (tc)   Payload (pl)   Payload Race (plr)   King of the Hill (koth)   Medieval Mode   Special Delivery (sd)   Mann vs Machine (mvm)   Robot Destruction (rd)   Arena (arena)   Mannpower   And here is a list of  unofficial  gamemodes:  Highlander  (TF2Center.com)    6v6  (TF2Center.com)    Saxton Hale Mode OR Freak Fortress (vsh)   Randomizer   Slender Fortress (sl)   Prop Hunt (ph)   Dodgeball    Zombie Fortress    Surfing (surf)   Jail Break   FortWars   And many more.    Hats/Cosmetics:   You don't need them to play a game. Players usually care so much about cosmetics, because they want to look good and feel good, while they play a game. Most of them, spend about $500 on the game, only because of the hats. Players also care about the 'qualities' of the items. Some qualities can be very expensive, so I don't suggest to spend money on crap. However, hats are not the only ones. Players also waste money on weapons, due different qualities or reskins.   IF you really want to get hats, then I suggest you to read this guide:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=248435114&amp;searchtext=Free+Hats  IF you want more hats, then I suggest you to understand, and learn some basics about the TF2 Trading Community, and about trading itself. Here is a guide:  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=158754458     Major Updates:   There are 2 different kinds of TF2 updates: Official Updates and Community Created Updates (they're official, too).  What's the difference, you ask?  Well, it's pretty simple:   Official Updates  - Are created by the main creator/company called VALVe. In their updates, you can find new gamemodes, new weapons (which are usually made in the summer or in the winter), new maps, bug fixes and especially there is a 90% chance that VALVe is going to add new hats, made by the community from the Steam's workshop.   Community Created Updates  - VALVe usually cares what community makes, but they don't allow community mess with the balance of the game, meaning VALVe doesn't allow us to create new weapons, which can have different stats, and especially add new maps. (However, VALVe added community maps only in the beginning, when TF2 was still new and fresh. But now everything is different, because in nowadays TF2 became as a very popular game.)  So like I said before, VALVe actually cares what community creates. So VALVe likes to add new hats and new weapons (just models) created by some talented people from the community. But majority of the community hates to see, that every new update has a new hat. And to be honest: It's normal.  If you didn't know, there was a big over hyped update called 'End of the Line', and it was actually the most useless update in the TF2. It had tons of cosmetics, a new taunt, a new weapon, which is a actually a reskin with no stats.  Before an update arrived, the community really hoped to see a map called 'Snowplow' with the new gamemode, but when the update arrived, the map was canceled by VALVe. VALVe said, that the map  is too confusing for new players . Later, that sentence became as a  meme , because other maps made by VALVe are more confusing, than a 'Snowplow'.     Anyways, let's move on:   Unbalanced Gameplay &amp; Weapons:   TF2 has 2 kinds of players: F2P (Free to Play) players (aka noobs) and P2P (Premium to Play) players (aka experienced players). Imagine BLU team full of noobs, and RED team full of experienced players. Is this a balanced match? Heck no. REDs would win every bloody match.  However, in VALVe servers you may find a voting system, which allows any player to vote something. Here is a list current voting types:  Kick Player   Restart the Match   Change Level/Next Level   Scramble Teams   Disable Team Autobalance   Eternaween (Allow Halloween-restricted items for two hours. Player must have an item to enable this voting choice.)   So imagine again those 2 teams again: Imagine, that you joined the BLU team, and you see that the teams are not balanced at all, and whenever you come out of your base - you always die. So you decide to vote to 'Scramble Teams'.  So what do you think what's going to happen?  The voting will fail, because your enemies are having fun AND because your teammates (noobs) doesn't know how to vote at all, or just completely ignores the voting.   Now let's talk about weapons, shall we?    Nah, let's not, because VALVe finally fixed all those unbalanced weapons. I could mention them like a long time ago, but now it's not worth it. I will still save this title, just in case.    The Story:   Well there is a story in the TF2, but unfortunately you can't find it in-game. You can only find it in the official TF2 comics. You can find comics in the Official TF2 Website, right  here.  [www.teamfortress.com]    The Community:   The community was great, until TF2 became for free. Right now, if you go to any official VALVe server, then you may hear some screaming or crying children with microphones. I hope your ears doesn't explode.  To be honest, TF2 community is still great. It depends where you live. Usually, I really love to play with Americans. I never loved to play with Europeans, because they love judge each other, and sometimes they're so speechless.  How cruel!    What is a Premium Account?   Premium account means an Upgraded account. In the beginning you can only have 1 backpack slot. If you buy something from the  Mann. Co Store  (in-game store), then your account will be upgraded and you will have 6 slots in your backpack. It's very important to have a Premium account, because 1 backpack slot if not enough for you.  I suggest you to buy a  Mann Co. Supply Crate Key . Once you bought something from the  Mann Co. Store  - don't use it again. Use it only to buy keys. Once you understand all basics about trading - you will know what to do with your bought key(s). (Just trade your key for the metal, and then buy tons of hats and weapons, as much as you want!)   Overall, my rating is 7 out of 10.  Remember:   Once you start to love this game, then there is a small chance, that you will leave it. Everything depends, what you like or love, or how (quickly) do you understand things.  Also, I am very sorry if I was very rude or mad in this review. It's because sometimes, TF2 can make your feelings hurt, especially your sanity. If you don't want to risk your life, then simply don't play this god damm game.    Have Fun!  ^.^"
I only played a little but it was fun.
"People had always said that Overwatch would kill TF2, but they were wrong, the Valve are the ones killing TF2.   So get ready for:  Stuff Valve F*cked Up in Meet Your Match Update (It's a long list so get ready)  - Got rid of quickplay - Added Casual - Didn't fix any of the weapons we asked to, instead nerfed balanced weapons and buffed OP weapons. - No more pubs - Can't join Valve Servers from browse server menu - Massive wait time for a 'CASUAL' game, then kicks you at the end of the match so you have to search for another 10 minutes again - After the 10 minutes of waiting, they put you in a server not in your region even though there are without a doubt plenty of servers in your region, Valve just wanted to say 'F*ck you mate' - Got rid of autobalance so that you can have a 12v2 in casual (AKA a boring time) - Matchmaking sucks - After waiting more than 3 weeks I thought Valve would fix their sh*t, but nah  During the Tough Break update I questioned if the TF2 team ever plays TF2 but I though 'Nah, they're just not that smart' and now during the Meet Your Match update I am certain the TF2 team doesn't ever play TF2 and that they are indeed pretty freakin dumb.   0/10 IGN (that's how you know the update is crap)"
"I've been playing this game for a few years now i've found wonderfull people, i've had amazing and memorable times playing on Pub's, Casual Servers, Slack off and idle Servers just being dumb and having a relaxing afternoon play, i've also played this game seriusly, like sweating blood seriusly, like i wanted to be a recognized Competetive player, and i even got accepted at a fake-wannabe UGC server having intense and just dizzing matches.  i've stand so many Update bullcrap over the years  but Meet your Match....man...  it was fun at the beggining where you could STILL PLAY PUBLIC SERVERS, the COMPETITIVE MODE WAS A MODE, AND I COULD CHOOSE THE GODAMN MAP I WANTED TO PLAY. choosing the freaking map you want to play! that's asking much? and now i have to wait atleast 10 minutes to play something i am assigned, with completely broken matching, i never thought i'd miss Autobalancing jesus...  scince i moved my internet got worse, but i could still play fairly well on Pub servers and great on Idle/Trade servers  now, i'm always laggy on 'Casual Mode' i can't play well, or feel any fun because everything is blinking and just stopping every 2 seconds PLUS a horrible, horrible delay of a second or two, i can't play basically nothing without just being terrible,the weapon balance is hideous, non-sensical and just absurd! it's not fun anymore.

Staff at Valve, keep your stupid Competitive Mode if you want, i want my Public servers back."
"Once you start, you just can't stop. Never before have hats had more meaning in my life."
"The update has ruined what possibly was the greatest game on steam. The casualness is what made the game great and it has been ripped away from the game, very saddened."
"It's so sad to be writing this, but the truth needs to be said. So let's start here: I had such a wonderful experience playing this game. Not ONLY because of the game itself, but because of everything it gave me; I can tell you a few things:   1. I met my first friend on steam while playing TF2, we've built a beautiful friendship: I consider him as my brother and he considers me as his sister. We live kinda far from each other, but we've already met in real life.  2. I got closer to a friend of mine that loves TF2. We had some problems in the past, then someday we started to play together and it feels like, nothing has ever happened.  3. It opened my eyes about a plenty of things on internet. I got scammed many times, people stole from me when I was noob, which made me learn more about trust.  Those and more facts made me love this game completely, and now, I'm not recommending it. Valve stopped making people happy, by 'people' I mean those who had even better moments while playing it. You see an update: hats/miscs/bugs/lag and that's it... OF COURSE I also wasted money there, I used to get so attracted by 'beautiful stuff' 'till I realize what I was doing. YOU GOTTA BUY SOMETHING THOUGH! If you're F2P you don't know how to play, you suck! AND WOOOW they're putting more guns in the store: all banned from competitive for being too OP (or they're really bad anyway). I seriously would like to join a server now and have fun! Ah... Yeah, they're empty because people are in trade servers just to show how much 'rich' they actually are. 'The worst kind of blind, is the one that doesn't want to see'. Why Valve? Why are you letting this happen to your game?! I wanna die from laughing with my friends again, I wanna recommend this game again and tell people how much it's worth! It's NOT a goodbye, I'll go back sometimes to see if I can have at least more 5 minutes of fun. In the same way TF2's marked my life, I hope it does for other people."
"Heard the term pay to win? This is pay for style. Even then, you don't even need to pay, just stock up tons of weapons or whatever and sell them metal. But that's not what I'm here to talk about. This game takes your regular console fps shooter sensibilites and throws it out of a two-story window into an oncoming semi-truck. There's nothing normal about this game, nearly every class has a counter, and some are harder to play than others. Sure, picking up a class and playing is really easy, but playing them right is where the challenge comes in. Watching the pros play is one of the greatest sights as they destroy servers and players with ease, and then being put head-to-head in tournaments is even better as you watch a non-stop highlight reel of fantastically displayed gameplay and style. Overall, this game has been around for almost 10 years now, and it's still going strong (somewhat), I recommend this to anybody who has not tried it yet."
"Martin Luther King Jr. John Lennon. JFK. Team Fortress 2. What do all of these have in common? They've been murdered. Killed. Reduced to a lifeless corpse. King, Lennon and JFK were ended by assassins. Team Fortress 2 was killed by the newest update. Let me tell you how this beautiful, amazing game was killed. Pros: New taunts (The Carlton is my favorite.) New guns for either the Pyro or Heavy. Minmode Cons: You get penalized for leaving Casual mid-game. Yes. CASUAL. (I'll talk about that more later) Custom HUDs are no longer usable. The matchmaking takes 30 minutes or more (Hooboy, I'm gonna rant about this) Teleporters are less expensive They nerfed the Pyro. Hard. (DPS is terrible. He's barely a threat anymore. Not even the Phlog can save him)   Now. Let me tell you in detail how much of a dumb idea it is to make you wait if you leave mid game in casual. 1.) It's CASUAL. 2.) IT'S CASUAL. 3.) IT'S ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ CASUAL. 4.) What if something happens to your internet? What if something abrupt and unexpected forces you to leave?  Matchmaking. The reason smurfing in CS:GO isn't as bad as it could be is because of one thing. The price tag. Every single time you want to make a smurf account, you have to pay for another copy of the game. But with TF2, it's free. So all you need to do to make a smurf account is to make another account, download the game, and buy the cheapest thing off of the Mann Co. Store. Plus, the whole skill based matchmaking is a terrible concept. You could have played this game for over 5000 hours, and still be meh. You could then go into the game, and be matched with people who have played similar hours, but these people are amazing at the game. 'Oh, but to play competitive, you have to buy a ticket' No, you actually don't. All you have to do is link your phone number to Steam, and you're ready to go.   I started playing shortly before the MannConomy update, and it breaks my heart to not recommend TF2. Most of my friends on Steam are from TF2. Hell, one of my best friends that I'm seriously considering travelling overseas just to stay with for a few months, was met on TF2. But now that Valve is trying to compete with Overwatch, even though if they stayed the same, Overwatch would have died anyways, I have to click the thumbs down. Goodbye, Team Fortress 2. I loved you. I loved seeing you grow. But I have to let go."
Very addicting fun game.
Good game to meet people and just have fun.
"This game was fun. Very fun, I could open up quickplay and hop on a Valve server of hightower and just mess around with silly loadouts for hours. Game was great, loved it.  In the newest update page I see that meet your match was released. Think to myself, oh, cool, a new update. I read the description, see a new 'casual' mode. Think to myself, 'oh, it's like a middle ground between comp and using quickplay to mess around in pubs. Think to myself, 'there's no way they'll replace quickplay with this new, 'casul mode.'  Wake up the next morning, start up TF2 with this new update, go to play on hightower.     There is no quickplay tab.   Think to myself, 'oh, well maybe they just reformatted quickplay as casual and they just do the same thing.' Try to play payload race, only let's me choose normal or alternative game modes.   Think to myself, 'they didn't, they f*cking didn't.'  Start search, welcome to casual, you can't leave, you can't choose the map, you can't have a voting system, oh, and also, go f*ck yourself.  Stops playing game.  Feels bad man.  Edit: Found a Youtube video that sums up this whole thing, feel free to check it out  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnGJP0ydSTc "
Very dissapointed with the new update with the quickplay removed and getting a penalty if you leave a casual match and trying to find a casual match takes forever. bring back quickplay.
"I was only 13 years old. I loved TF2 so much. I was always at the bottom of servers. I pray to Gaben every night, hoping I would get a hat someday. 'Gaben is love,' I said. 'Gaben is life.'  My dad overhears me and calls me a wm1. I know he's just jealous cos he got dominated. I call him a bodyshotter.  My dad airshots me and sends me to my room. As I feel my numb face, I turn on my PC and log into Steam. My hands are shivering as I click on the 'PLAY' button to open up TF2.  'I'll show that bodyshotter,' I said. I open up the Steam Market Place, and purchase 20 Half Life 3 Cases and Keys.  10 minutes have passed by, and I've unboxed 19 Strange Neon Annihilators As I move my cursor over to the final case, I click and select 'OPEN'. My cursor moves even slower as I move it towards the giant, green 'USE KEY' button.  I click the button.  'I can't look,' I said to myself. 'My dad will bodyshot me when he see's that I've spent six grand on super exclusive and rare Half Life 3 Cases and Keys.  I close my eyes and listen as I hear Gaben laughing over me, as if I am almost certain that I did not get a hat.  I open my eyes.   A large clump of feces leaves my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ very quick, as my eyes look at the item I have just been given by the Holy Gaben himself.  Another clump starts sliding out as I stand up to run to my dad to tell him that I've just unboxed a Ghastly Gibus.  My dad cries as his steam server gets overwhelmed with furries. I wear my new hat and noscope his face.  I then walk into my room, equip my disguise kit and crouch, imagining Gaben with me.  'Gaben is love, Gaben is life.'"
"This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fulfill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels. The game has an active dev team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons or game modes.  At the time of this review, there are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'.  Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objective or objectives for each team to achieve.  'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, 'Mann Up', gives rewards upon completing a 'tour'.  In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available.  In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them.  The game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play. I have been playing since January 2015 and I still return to the game on a regular basis."
This is a Great Game XD
This game is the best FPS game I've ever played.  It's so fun! Everything is balanced. Nothing is 'OP'. There are plenty of weapons to choose from (most of the time stock is the best)  It's a very fun/goofy game but still has great gameplay and also great graphics!  Another bonus is you dont need the greatest computer in the world to run it.  and if you are a person who loves hats. this is the game for you :D     My favorite game....ever
new tf2 is a piece of ....... You have to wait hours to play......change it back QQ
 Reasons why TF2 is bad:
"Brilliant game up until the 'Meet your Match' update. They removed pub servers and now force you to go through the 'casual' route, which is anything but casual. The wait time is unbearable (30+ mins to find a server, although I have had no such luck in joining anything), you cannot join a game unless it is completely full and theres now a pay wall introduced to actual competitive play which relies on authentication on a mobile device which not all people have. Trading now takes 15 days to complete without this app and all valve does now is release taunts and hats. Oh not to mention COMMUNITY made maps ( Cannot be bothered making their own ). Gone are the days you could just hop into a Valve pub for fun, now you have to hop and wait 30+ mins and everyone takes 'casual' very seriously due to the xp counter.  Of all the games I have played, I would not dream of writing a negative review on this beauty. But there you have it Valve. Great job."
"Even though i truely love tf2, and gladly enjoyed every single hour i put into it, this update ruined it for me.   The downtime is just unbearable, and the whole dynamic of the game is gone.  Also, 0 of the actual problems 'tf2 veterans' wanted to be fixed, got adressed.  I wont touch this trainwreck unless valve comes with some serious solutions.  Bye for now."
 Reasons why TF2 is bad:
"As soon as i played this game i couldent stop, Its so addictive and fun to play with all your friends. You get to mess around with weponds you wouldent have thought you could fight with. The maps are AMAZING lots of choises to chose from. The design for the characters look amazing i couldent have imagined then looking any different."
"After the new update TF2 has really made it unfair. Should a team lose players, in the previous updates the numbers of players were swapped so we at least had some semblance of balanced teams. With the new update, there is no such thing as balanced teams nor is there any voting option to balance teams.  Now its common to have a full team (11 or 12) against 4 or less players for an entire round. When you have lvl3 sentries with a full team complement guarding all spawn points, then 4 players amount to nothing.  Way to go Valve!!! (In case its not clear, that is sarcasm)."
Wasted too much time on this game. I regret nothing besides spending my lunch money on TF2 ;_;
"TF2 is a casual free to play first person shooter. On its own, that doesn't really translate to much, but with a wide variety of game modes, incredibly high skill-cap, and diverse classes with a variety of weapons to cater to a large amount of playstyles, TF2 does stand out as being a cut above the rest.    Balancing unfortunately, isn't as strong as it could be and there are a few legitimately overpowered weapons, and not all classes are equal in usefulness. However, with the lack of cash shop based game stats, and the default weapons generally being the most versatile and reliable in the game, on top of the skill-caps of the classes; Keeping in mind the casual nature of the game, any issue with balance is minor enough that it can be worked around through player skill and team-coordination.   Their business model only requires a single item to be purchased from the in-game store--or to be gifted a premium upgrade package--at which point, any cosmetic weapon, or upgrade can be found through playing the game, crafted, or purchased through in-game resources. It's a very fair game, with one of the best free to play models in the market.  The primary difficulty you'll find with the game is starting it. With a lackluster tutorial, un-cordinated public games, and little assistance in the relatively deep tactics and game mechanics for the various classes, it can be hard to become skilled enough to coordinate in solo-play. Playing with friends, and doing some research into the game is highly recommended, as TF2 won't do it for you.  TF2, on it's own is highly mod-friendly, and has a variety of community made servers running custom game modes. With a bit of searching, you can find hangouts, mini-games, training servers, custom maps, unofficial weapons, and the like. On top of the official game, and fairly friendly community, it's not especially difficult to get hundreds of hours of enjoyment out of the game without any issues, or requirements to invest money.    It has its problems, but ultimately they are minor. What TF2 offers is a rich FPS experience, with enough community support to satisfy a variety of tastes. So I have no issues recommending this game to any FPS fan looking for a team-focused, objective based shooter."
"I love Team Fortress 2!,   I hate what Team Fortress 2 became...  "
"TF 2, the only game where you dance konga with the whole enemy team to a blue briefcase as you play a fat russian sandvich dispenser throwing sandviches in the air and yellin' POOT DISPENSER HERE. 10/10 would hoovy again"
Best free Game ever
i rily liked this game but when the 8 july ubdate came i just wona uninstale the game
its literally cartoony cs: go now.  i want to die
Have played this game for 1.6k hours and it is far from getting old for me. Tf2 has its quirky bugs and unbalanced weapons but all of those things make Tf2 Tf2! TF2 is the best game ever!
No thanks. 'Meet your match' killed the game.
You just can't get bored of this game. :)) After all these years still a great game!
The meet your match update... Gross.....
"To start off, let me just say that TF2 is really fun. But.  This update, meet your match. Won't be reverted, it WILL NOT be reverted. This follows my experience in watching game devs, they believe it will work if they simply give it time.  There was a hell of a fun in TF2, but, in the end. It was a casual game the hid some competitve elements, however it was never designed, as a whole, to be competitve. One person *could* replace 3-4 if those people decided to conga at spawn and while you could say community servers now exist for that, no they don't. A community server will never replace a pub.   If you wanted a community server, you could search for it. If you wanted a pub, you could search for it and if you wanted matchmaker, you could search for it if the devs had done this update right.  What it attempts to do, is push TF2 into a competitve light. Newsflash Valve, the streaming section in TF2 was used by barely anyone and provided nothing but an annoyance. Matchmaker is a good idea, don't get me wrong, but it's also a horrible idea simple because it's replaced pub matches. You want to quit? 20 minute ban that goes up and up. Crap map? 20 minute wait. You want X gamemode only? nope, have to choose at least two gamemodes. If I wanted to matchmake in CTF or something, on such and such map, you bloody well better let me choose.   The upside is that after matchmaker has been out for a while, the problems in relation to skill ratio will weed themselves out. But if I just get home from work, want to screw around in a match with a map I can actually pick, one I can kill people in one minute, focus the objective the other and conga next to some friendly's the next, one I can offclass in without worrying about 'point drain,' then why is it that I have to go to someone elses server that is probbaly running something cancerous such as minecraft or alltalk just so I get squeakers ♥♥♥♥ talking one another.   I'm going to play the ♥♥♥♥ out of matchmaker, but I'm ♥♥♥♥ing angry that such a big slip up could be made. Pub's and 'casual' could very easily both be run at the same time and you can't tell me they don't have enough money since servers cost something, MvM often has 40+ servers free of action even at peak hours in the AUS region, one of the most expensive regions.   'But the community can run servers just like pubs'   True, they can. But I think those servers will be few and far. Not to mention the ads.   TL;DR. Volvo saw CS:GO and decided TF2 could do the same where in reality they are two different games."
"A really funny game to spend time, everyone should at least try it :)"
The new Meet your Match update ruined the game for me its like im playing a csgo clone I loved this game but now its fallen apart.
It's TF2.
"After all these years, TF2 is still one of the most balanced and dynamic shooter games out there. The art style is a refreshing break from the usual quasi-realistic-grim-tactical asthtic of most other popular shooter games. The action is fast paced, there are always new stratagies to try, and this game is great with friends. Whats not to love?"
"I have played TF2 for 4 years. This update is the worst ever!! Why valve didnt answer expectation. I liked TF2... I was sad... Im sad... Valve, I put a cucumber in the your a.s.s!!!!!!!!"
"What can i say, MVM is way better than watching grass grow or paint peel good challenge lotsa loot excellent exercise for any under-stimulated brain young or old!"
"Dear tf2,   I've spend a lot of time with you, about 1200 hours I think.  I've spend some of Halloween nights with you, and even some Christmas days.  You were the glue that bound me and a bunch of online friends together, and I am thankful.   But tf2, you've mutated, for me it all started with gun skins and contracts. It all felt kinda weird and soulless, then I saw you destroy the end of the line update, and now this, and I realized you aren't what you one were; a great friendly community filled game with tons character, some would even call an interactive work of art. You have turned into a greedy egotistical shadow of what you once was.   This is an intervention tf2, please get some help."
"Being a player with over 5000 hours in this once beautiful game, all I can say after this recent update is: What? You force Matchmaking onto everyone, and to even play Comp you need to buy a pass. And for casual you need to wait god knows how long to even find a server. Where did the quick pub experience I always enjoyed go? What happened? Hell, bring my old menu back and I'll be happy but FFS you can't undo all the damage that's been done at this point, can you? I'm sorry, but at this point I might end up considering this game Dead. You've disappointed me Valve. And I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one. If Valve fixes this then I might reconsider a review that's more positive but this.... This is not the TF2 I fell in love with. I don't know this stranger in my Game Library, or why it's pretending to be TF2.... But I know this is not TF2 anymore."
"Recent update broke the game. I can't select game mode, nor can I play the game at all as the coordinator is down, yay! I don't care for competetitive, let me do pubstomping!"
"Valve,Why did you do this? You have turned my faorite game into this it used to be a fn time game and now look what you have done tf2 has chanded in a bad way.... Valve,Gaben Please change and put it back"
What are competitive ranks for lol
"I love the game, I love TF2, but I do not love the recent 'big' updates released for the game, I could not recommend the game enough before the arrival of the 'Tough Break' Update &amp; the star of the review the 'Meet your Match' Update, these two updates in conjunction just devastated the game and really ruined the communities and my own opinion on what is going on behind the Valve development teams minds, The game has transformed from such a massive close community with brilliant trading, casual gameplay and the odd one or two competitive tournaments, into a now degraded, rundown slum of something which was so great.  Before you wonder I started playing Team fortress 2 on 'The Orange Box' when the game was fresh and barley stable with the bugs on maps which were hilarious and fun to play around with then around that time of course a few fixes and brilliant updates came along to introduce trading and of course the renowned cosmetic feature, the community was fantastic, trade servers were fun and polite, trading was simple and 1 : 1 with the seller and soon to be purchaser it is hard to think back on it now and it physically pains me to see this game drop so low, The recent updates introduced 'Skins' which in my opinion were completely unneeded and stupid to even consider in the first place, I can only assume from the mass success of 'Counter strike: Global Offensive' the idea to implement this was from that as it is another Valve game, along with this they introduced 'Qualities' and 'Wear' which is just annoying and disgusting to look at as I am so used to just having a item with its name and description and maybe its level with a short description next to it nothing else and to add to that the new items only have this implemented to the items so all the other items just don't fit in and don't have this feature which just mind boggles me with why on earth this was ever a good idea it's ugly, stupid and by this point I was scared and disturbed as for what could possibly happen in the next updates to come and well the answer to that question was all too quickly answered. They then went ahead to announce and implement the somewhat awaited 'Competitive mode' inside the new 'Meet your Match' Update, now this does not sound all too bad just from that and in all honestly if that was it to the update along with a few new fixes or maps I will be beyond happy but they just had to do something stone cold wrong, they decided to close and remove all Vanilla Team fortress 2 casual play servers, this intern meaning you are now unable to simply find a Valve official server, click a map you enjoy and just have some fun oh no, You now either have to join the competitive mode which for one is completely and utterly broken, autobalance was completely removed, ranks mean nothing so you get placed with people way over or under your skill level, there is only a 30 minute penalty for leaving nothing else meaning if someone on your team or the enemies team leave it is almost a instant lose and along with that even if you lose and get 3 gold medals you can still get deranked I mean, what on earth Valve were you thinking to add to this if you wish to have a casual match you are put into a lobby finder of which can range from anywhere to 5 minutes to over an hour just to find one game but even then when you finally join the match everything including the HUD display and layout is exactly the same as competitive so it's just a carbon copy of the same rubbish given to us from the competitive mode HOWEVER there is still the community servers of which are usually filled with spam, adverts and of course terrible ping/maps.  I feel I have rambled on enough about this but please if this gets rated up onto the store page or if Valve/The Development team read this listen to the community right now you communication between us and you is terrible and we need you to listen more than ever now.  I do not recommend this game until the above is fixed/removed/changed for the better, Thanks for reading."
"Hats, Taunts and skins, I like this."
Did Activision secretly buy the game from Valve?  Because i havnt seen anything this ♥♥♥♥ since mw2
this is still a very good game great even i enjoy the community severs (like slender fortress and death run) a lot. if u want to play a game with a great community sever on it this is the game for u.

"This game used to be fun. Team Fortress 2 used to have the friendliest community, where people would help eachother learn how to rocket jump and give an Engineer tips on Sentry placement. Now its got hordes of lime green and pink Scouts running in, killing everything that moves, and putting 'git gud scrub' in chat with a keybind.  This game used to be fun. For some it may still be fun to play, for others its a way to pass the time, and some people only still play because it has become routine to do so. And for many the in-game economy has actually become a job, a business, even if they don't work for Valve or any other software developer. If Valve were to remove metal and cosmetics entirely, many people would lose hundreds or thousands of dollars. This isn't even a game anymore.  People who play TF2 say that many aspects of this game need fixing. 'Why would you nerf the Heavy and not the Demman?' I would say that the whole thing needs fixing. Specifically the community.  This game used to be fun. The community used to be fun to be a part of. A few months ago it has become just as bad as the Call of Duty fanbase and community.  You may still find it fun to play this game. You may somehow find the patience to deal with another toxic community. My patience is shot, I can deal with no more.  If any of you need me, I'll be playing a single player game. I can actually play those without being told 'git gud, noob' or 'get rekt, scrub' after every death. The NPCs of a Singleplayer game like Fallout or Metro are certainly friendlier than the real people who play Team Fortress 2."
"Played it a bit, found a cool hat, made a scrap with sandwiches, broke my E key. 10/10 want to comment everywhere."
Exellence! Nothing else to say!
"I've been playing this game since 2011, i was free to play until my father gave me $5 to spend and i got 2 keys, and my free to play days were over. Ever since then I have fell in love with the game. The people, the maps, the items, mostly my friends is the reason i still keep playing this game. I would reccomend this game to anyone who has an open imagination. (Demoman is my favorite class, i love blowing ♥♥♥♥ up :3)"
"Meet Your Match, A.K.A. The update that broke everything.  Viewmodels broke, FOV broke, I cannot play MvM anymore either, Casual Mode replaced Quickplay and is incredibly worse. Well, make what you will of this update, but seeing how many bad reviews there are of this update, even from people with people with less or more hours than I have, they already all said in more details what's wrong with this right now. I'm just doing my part in hopes the bad reviews start showing in the 'Most Recent' reviews section of the game page, hopefully Valve will start caring more than having to rely on its community to do everything, but you know as well as I do that probably won't be the case."
"'The Best F2P FPS on Steam! 9/10..'    -Sincerely, Me.  "
"Hat Simulator 2: Hat harder, what can I say about it that hasn't been said already? It's fun, it's free, it's got cool stuff that is seriously underplayed, and the classes and asthetic are nearly timeless. But, you've heard that a thousand times. What of the meat and bones? The mechanics that everything is built on? Gotta say, hella good. The interplay of a lot of slightly different weapons and the drastically different classes combines well with the objective focus, but more importantly it makes you ask yourself silly questions. Like, 'what if I ran a melee medic?' 'or a melee heavy?' 'What could make this more fun to play?' It is a great game, with great appeal, but most importantly the mechanics are fun. Plus who could argue with the price?   Now if they would just do more with the magic spells, and medieval mode, and the bosses, then I would have no complaints."
Best dress-up simulator ever created.
Once you hat you never go back.
Team Fortress 2 is a very enjoyable game whether your in to have some fun or for the competition. (Or whenever you find yourself bored)
"One of the best multiplayer games on Steam. Come m8, come into the Team Fortress world. *Holds out hand*"
"Team Fortress 2, the game where buying vitural hats are more expensive than actually buying them in real life.  10/10 needs more Gibus"
I have played this game on many accounts... and now they done ♥♥♥♥ed up
Team Fortress 2 is a graet game and should be played but the new update ruins the game with casual play and everything else this shity uptade brings -100\10
I am srry i am this guy that just wanted to play tf2 again cus he played it alot when he was younger soooo yeah i have plaued alot of overwatch and now i am in this ♥♥♥♥ing game again yes AGAIN this ♥♥♥♥ing sucks all the ♥♥♥♥ing valve servers are down if you have to eat u will get a ♥♥♥♥ing cooldown and that is for casual I would recomend overwatch i know that you need to play for that game but do it its just beter just go and buy it this game is doomed thx valve for destroying a game i loved when i was younger
how the hell do you mess up a good free to play game this badly
I spent more money buying virtual cosmetics than actual clothes.  8.5/10
I spent the 'first' thousand hours trying to figure out which outfit fits my character.    It was alright.
"Only one good map, Sawmill, played it for 200 hours straight and still not bored.  Best F2P game in existance."
"#MakeTF2GreatAgain  Quick Play was fine, no need to make it like comp.   I just want to play 2Fort all day every day. Now that this system is in it's almost impossible.  Do you even realize how long CTF matches go? With people voting the time up and up every three seconds?  Or turtles?   Let's also touch up on this fact: I clicked off every game mode except CTF. It put me on payload. I couldn't leave otherwise I'd be punished for leaving. YOU STUCK ME ON A GAMEMODE I DID NOT WANT TO PLAY. Why should I be punished for YOUR failure?  Keep the harsh restrictions to Comp and leave quickplay or in this case 'Casual' alone.   Casual F*ck Up is a better title for it.  As a friend said: Overwatch isn't Killing TF2. Valve Is."
Great game. very underrated
"The Servers lag, it takes 7 shots with a shotgun to kill somebody, hats are priced in the hundreds and everybody is better than you.  Overall still better than CS:GO  10/10"
I told myself I'd never spend money on pixels or give a care about 'hats'. Well ... ♥♥♥♥.  Team Fortress 2 ruined my wallet and my life. 10/10
The new update made this game into a pile of horsecrap. Totally ruined the idea of playing a few quick matches
Cool game :D
good. end of story.
I have wasted more than 50$ in this piece of ♥♥♥♥ and bearing trying to kill that one guy that presumes his better hat at me  195/10 would critical hit review this again
TF2  - Judge Mental - Meta's Come from Youtube Videos - Anyone funny is seen as a good player - Hats are a must if you want seem good - Why do I play this game  8/10
sif give away the best game on Steam
"This Game was really good till the latest 'Meet your Match' Update. Now it is just bad and sucks a lot. Why?   1. You are randomly moved to a Server and a Team. You can't choose your Team, Map and the Location of the Server. I was moved to a Server far away many times so I had a high Ping and it was unplayable.Other Teammates/Enemies having a High ping too and this causes unfair kills.  2. Search Times are still very long.It takes like Minutes to finally find a Server.  3. You just play a few Round on ONE Map and then you have to disconnect and search for a new Server.  4. The Game Coordinator and API are down so often so you can't play (still 4-5x per Day).  5. Teams are still unbalanced like hell and you have to play with your Team the WHOLE Map. I tried to play a few Rounds but it was balanced only one time. Even if you're on the good Team, it is not fun.  6. Casual needs a lot of fixes, like a Class limit, Ping Limit etc. I don't want to play against Heavys or Engineers.  7. Ranks are just pure cosmetics.  8. Removing Autobalance is much worse than having it. Autobalance was hated but needed, now you play 12 vs 7 or 8 till someone joins your running match, but this takes too long.  Team Fortress wanted to be like CS Go with the Skins and now it want to be Overwatch but it doesn't work. It is over 9 Years old and now they change everything?  After playing Team Fortress over 2.300 Hours I'll do a long break. I don't have fun anymore.  NEVER Stop a running System.   R†I†P Team Fortress 2.  If you see me still playing Team Fortress 2, then I am only on Friendly or Trade Servers"
"I love this game so much, not only is it fun. But it is better when you bring a friend along to fight against the never-ending horde of the opposing team. I would reccomend this to anyone."
"I like this game. Honestly, for all my complaints about it, I really and truly love this game. But, it's a sinking ship. Now, don't get me wrong, there's a lot good with it. Tons of ways to play, loads of weapons, hundreds of maps, and it's easy enough to learn. On the other hand though, it has it's fair share of issues.  The community is pretty much the number 1 problem. Ever since Valve made it F2P, hordes of idiots no longer hindered by the issue of paying for it joined the bandwagon, meaning that even people who shouldn't be able to contribute to the experience now can. Through this, any potential good people see the way that the masses play, and adopt the 'strategies' {W+M1ing, 'nade spamming, healing only heavies, etc.} for their own, leading to an endless spiral of stupidity. Additionally, every single time SPUF throws a temper tantrum over something being 'op' {OMG vlve git rd of sandman!}, Valve caves in and nerfs the offending material, so expect to have to relearn to use your favorite weapons every other month or so. As a final aside, apart from a few servers here and there, rest assured that almost every server you visit will be a mish mash of people who should still be training on bot servers {and should probably never leave them}, people who are leagues better than you and only there to grind stranges and spam memey nonsense, traders who are only there to idle/spam trade requests, and the occasional troll. Very rarely will you find a server where everyone is polite, actively playing, and more or less on your skill level. The same issues also plauge co-op mode {Mann vs Machine, or MvM}. You'd expect to see the usual pub filth in Boot Camp {and you do}, but not in Tour of Duty mode, which is pay to play. Nope. You'll still see the normal assortment of trade spammers, caber demoknights, gunslinger engis, people that call for kicks over any and everything, and really just a general lack of common sense. And as of the newest update, in both versus and co-op, if you're repeatedly placed on garbage teams, you either have to suck it up and stay, or recieve a temporary matchmaking ban.  After the community, I'd say Valve themselves are the next biggest problem. Everytime you turn around, there's a new hat, a new misc item, a new kit to make your weapon fire glowy pumpkins and set your head on fire after a few kills, and so on and so forth. New weapons though, which one would think would be the core of an online fps, are rarely released, with multi-year periods between weapon packs. Tons of reskins though, including the insanely rare golden ones, and that stupid frying pan that goes for over $4k {in a f2p game, no less}. Although to be fair, weapon stats are changed so much that we technically get new weapons every now and then. This game has gone from 'Capture the point and kill all enemies in your way' to 'holy wow guise stout shako 3 ref trade me up!'. It's no longer an fps, it's a dress up game with murder as an optional sidequest. Valve sadly seems to longer care about making the game fun as much as they do fattening their wallets. One need look no further than the Halloween events of the last 3 years, where the new gameplay elements more or less amounted to 'pick up this item and mindlessly spam instant death beams' and dozens {yes, dozens} of misc items being released, the majority of which can't even been worn once the event ends or outside of a full moon.  Truly, the golden age of this game is over, with any competent players bound to permanently rage-quit sooner or later."
This is a F2P game in which I've spent and I will spend lot of hours playing! Isn't a standard FPS game because of the amount of funny class available to pick! Worth the time downloading for sure!
Hats. Enough said.  10/10 Would recommend for Gaben.
One of the many reasons I love this game: DEMOMAN(injured):MEDIC! MEDIC:NO!(and runs in the spawn and starts taunting conga); SCOUT(on fire):FIRE FIRE FIRE! MEDIC(still dancing conga):NO! ENEMY HEAVY:RUN HOME TO MAMA! SCOUT:AAA THIS NO GOOD HERE UMMMM! SCOUT(dies) MEDIC(still dancin conga):OPSS THAT WASN'T MEDICINE! DEMOMAN(after killing the enemy heavy was still injured and called for the medic again):MEDIC! MEDIC(still in spawn now dancing roodeo):NO! DEMOMAN(I wanted to use the voice line JEERS! but I accidently press THANKS and demoman sees):I DIDN't NEED YOUR HELP YOU KNOW MEDIC(DEMOMAN is killed by ENEMY SPY and MEDIC goes):I AM ZHE WINNER! 10/10-I laugh every time when I remember that moment.
"Edit 30/07/2016: Now officially poor man's overwatch. At least TF2 has 66 tick though  Flaming duck unusuals, also a $5 rubber duck event.  No new map for months because 'too advanced'. A community made map was refused. Despite unpaid efforts from the community creators for a year.  A new gamemode with grappling hooks and 9 modifiers is okay though, because Valve.  Fundamental changes to classes that have existed in a thriving game for 7 years, because apparently they were the reason this game went downhill.  Also, gimmick weapons that seek to support the handicapped players. Danger Shield still in. Minisentry is still broken.  ♥♥♥♥ you, Valve."
"The new match making system is terrible. With the new system, I wait around for 10 minutes to join a game. Before it only took a few seconds... I will NOT tolerate this match making system. GO BACK TO THE OLD SYSTEM!"
I hate what TF2 has become.

"Team Fortress 2 has been regularly updated since its inception in 2007, after over nine years in development. Due to all these updates, the game has actually taken on several incarnations. In other words, I will be individually reviewing the following three separate games:  Team Fortress 2 (2007-2010) Hat Fortress 2 (2010-2012) Dressup Fortress 2 (2012-present)  But first, General: -You can regularly defy the laws of physics in too many ways to be listed. -Scouts can fly by flapping their legs. -A can of soda turns you into the Super-Matrix; you can make bullets dodge you. -Some pistols can make you jump higher or fully absorb the impact of falling at any velocity. -Coating someone in milk and then beating them up will cure your cancer. -Steel-toed boots make shooting rockets at your feet less unhealthy. -Whipping people makes them run faster. -A big Russian guy can survive as many direct hits from an anti-tank missile as a Russian T-72 tank can. -Blowing into a seashell can patch the gunshot wounds of everyone around you. -Flamethrowers can also shoot a powerful blast of air that can send people flying or rockets back to their maker. -You can beat people to death with a bottle of whiskey. -You can decapitate people with a golf club. -Harmless explosives. -Eating a sandvich will cure AIDS, mend katana wounds, and treat your erectile dysfunction. -Hitting a machine with a wrench will fix it, upgrade it, and resupply it. -Dispensers generate ammo for your weapon and pills for your back pain. -A remote control with one big red button can be used to destroy one of any four buildings of your choosing. -You can shoot up morphine with a crossbow. -You can use a beam of light to turn someone’s exterior skin and clothing into pure titanium armor. -Pretending to play the violin with a bonesaw used for amputation will cure the common cold. -Urine is more effective than a fire extinguisher. -Frenchmen with ski masks are incapable of stabbing their victims in the neck. When they encounter Australians with shields on their backs, they’ll stab the shield first… Making the shield disintegrate. -A pocket watch can partially absorb the damage caused by a rocket, create a deceased doppelganger of you, all while you become invisible and walk away. -If you backstab someone with an icicle, they’ll instantly transform into a highly-durable ice sculpture.   Team Fortress 2 (2007-2010) This was a team-based first person shooter involving two identical teams, differing only in color and artistic design, vying for control of various strategic locales around the world. You could play as one of nine cripplingly overspecialized classes. The various classes would have to pool their strengths together and cooperate in order to prevail over the opposing team. However, this was easier said than done as communication and teamwork were (and still are) generally foreign concepts. Teams would have to beat each other up and steal their briefcases, beat each other up and steal their stage lighting platforms, and beat each other up to push a high explosive bomb cart into a pit. Hats were just a cool side thing. Many people would stand around and do nothing on dedicated idle servers so that they could amass the metal necessary to craft themselves a new hat.  Overall, Team Fortress 2 was a fun and highly addictive game whether or not there was a team or no team involved.  Over 9 out of 9, worth the weight.  Hat Fortress 2 (2010-2012) The Mann-Conomy Update, released on September 30, 2010, marked the end of Team Fortress 2 and the birth of Hat Fortress 2. Players no longer needed to idle to get hats. They could also buy them, trade for them, and even sell them for other hats. In addition, keys were also introduced, giving players the ability to throw away their parent’s or their own hard-earned money on opening virtual crates in the hopes of getting virtual hats. More often than not, they ended up getting worthless virtual guns. The Mann-Conomy fever quickly swept over Team Fortress 2, reducing it to a side game. Hat Fortress 2 was about accumulating as many hats as possible by any means necessary and then using the Team Fortress 2 mini-game to show them off to others. The free-to-play update in 2011 further enlarged the player base, increasing the popularity of Hat Fortress 2, its modes, and related fun mini-games. As Hat Fortress 2 was further refined and developed, new elements were added, including unusuals and non-hat cosmetic items. Eventually, so many new cosmetics came in that Hat Fortress 2 gradually evolved into another game.  11 hats out of 10.  Dressup Fortress 2 (2012-Present) This is the current and ultimate form of Team Fortress 2. The game is centered on assembling a complete outfit for each of the classes that you play. You can acquire the components for your dream outfit by unboxing crates of all shapes and sizes and/or by implementing any one of the many trading strategies out there. You can show off your outfits, topped off with exorbitant unusual hats, in a multitude of ways. You can do the conga, hi-five other folks adorned with fancy and quirky outfits, play intense games of rock, paper, scissors, or play Jack Black’s guitar. You can also play whatever vestiges remain of the old Team Fortress 2. You could also play Mann vs. Machine and acquire stock weapons with robotic skulls hanging from them or perhaps even become The Man with the Golden Gun. If neither of those are satisfactory, there are a wide range of other mini-games to play, some of which have been around since the days of old Team Fortress 2. They include, but are not limited to: Versus Saxton Hale, Freak Fortress 2, Jailbreak, Balloon Race, TF2 Kart, magic spells in Halloween event maps, Slender Fortress, Surf maps, Jump maps, and TF2Ware.  In conclusion, Dressup Fortress 2 does provide something for everyone, so I guess it’s alright.  11/10 iterations of Gaben. And my favorite class is the Spy. Thanks, and have fun!"
"If you like guns and hats, this is the game for you."
 Eat a sandwich while getting shot at Simulator GOTY    (Gaben of The Year) :')  
"This is by far the most awesome game I've ever played, I've never seen such variety in any other game before, so many different mods, texture packs, it's flexibility, it's support, it's just lovely and I always get back to it. The freedom you have in this game is incredible, you can noclip through every map, record demos which you can then play back from different angles, movierecording at any fps rate, relatively powerful scripting language, dedicated private free serverhosting, easy access to players on the server to contact them, all textures editable, gravity editable, it's just purely amazing. And it's also relatively bug free by now, compare this to other AAA titles nowadays, there's nothing like this, that'S why I find myself always getting back to it. And it's not just about fragging &amp; killing either, there is also the medic which heals people, you can play surf maps or jump maps to pull off AMAZING stunts, each of the 9 classes is fun in its own way. The moviescene is also huge and this game is almost 6 years old now and is still very actively played.. for reasons! 10/10!"
"This game, one of the top shooter games that i'll ever play. I'm usually an rpg fanboy but this shooter, really takes the cake for me. I love just spending all my time on a few multiplayer maps, gradually getting good at them. Heck, this game is what made me get into the fps genre. This is a must play game by any fps fans out there. It's such a unique shooter, almost as much as Borderlands. This is a must play. It's also a free game so don't worry about money. 9/10"
"I was hooked on this game as soon as I got it. I demand that everyone gets this game, don't ask any questions just go out and get it now   You want my full review? *sigh* fine.   TF2 is made by the gods of game developers Valve. TF2 brings in so much stuff to make the online FPS genre feel like a new fresh idea. Tons of more classes that, unlike COD, feel like they're different with different appeareances and customization options.   Gameplay is done in a sort of way to make the player, like me, get addicted to this and make them not want to move for a while, until you improve and make it so that you're the best possible. If u find a server with a perfectly balanced team, you will have tons of fun, filled with tons of tension and tons of fun.   TF2 throws realism out the window, goes with a full cartoon tint and cartoon gore and rarely takes anything seriously and it knows it doesn't take itself seriously at times and I respect it for doing that as I haven't seen many shooters that do this sort of thing. It's either that shooters take themselves really seriously, which is the majority of the shooters out there or shooters that take themselves so seriously that it's funny.   The classes actually feel unique. Unlike other shooters where it feels like it doesn't really matter what class I take, in TF2 it really does dependon your playstyle. I like playing pyro because I wanna set the  Universe on fire  .   TF2 is a nice breath of fresh air and I'm glad to see that it doesn't follow what other game devs are doing which is why I really respect Valve for making this.   Pros:  + Addicting  + Good classes  + Good gameplay  + Creative graphics  + Hats/Misc  Cons  - A few annoying glitches - Scammers - Some hackers  - Quite many tryhards"
"I played it only for a bit, but it seems ok."
"I used to really love that game, i wasted a lot of time and money in that game and i was happy about it. After the meet your match update the game became completly unplayable. The matchamaking is slow as hell, the casual have nothing about casual. The kills and deaths records in casual matchs but no assistance record (yeah yeah, medic kinda looks like sh*t then with their 0 kills - 40 deaths) The matches are very stressful, the team with leaving players is completly penalised and the match only last for one map, which means you have to go for another 10 minute of research after this. MvM cannot be played anymore because of the 'leave/rejoin' that no longer allow you to press esc to cancel it, comunity servers are awful, always the same maps with stupid plugins or instarespawns, ads everywhere and some server that make afk players bots, yes that makes them stupid but thats also a legal aimbot with 360° sight. This updates added a few 'balances' some really good ones : the sun on a stick, the eureka effect (still not worht using but thats a start) and some unjustified nerfs : the vaccinator is now a potato because of pyros ability to remove 25% shield. The pyro have been buffed ways too much, a w m1 pyro can take out a heavy medic combo alone, probably die in the process but he can deal the 450 health of the heavy in less that 2 seconds. In it's current state the game is not even fun to play, the matchmaking is the worse update valve ever made to tf2.  Until some changes, i'm not recommending that game."
"If you click your mouse on people, they get salty. 10/10 would recommend"
I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH BUT THIS NEW UPDATE OF 7/8/2016 IS BAD. PLS do all tf2 players something and CHANGE tf2 back keep comp BUT THE NORMAL STEAM SERVERS lost of people need that and you took away a few games from normal mode that PEOPLE LOVE pls make tf2 great again !!!!
"Well I made a website dedicated to it, so it must be good."
"10/10. This game is really addictive. The gameplay, the community, the fun, it's all there.  There are lots on in-game items such as cosmetics, taunts, etc. These kinda ruined the game (what I think).  But other than that, this game would never bore you. Recommended."
TF2 took all of my money and now I'm a broke hooker.
"As Forrest Gump would say: 'This game is like a box of chocolates, You never know what you're going to get.' I would agree.  Also the community is probably my favorite part about this game....Besides the annoying FTP 10 year old squeekers.  9.5/10"
"...that Meet the Spy was leaked onto YouTube on May 17, 2009, two days before its intended release?    ...that the SMG was originally intended for the Scout?    ...that a telefrag will instantly fill the Buff Banner's gauge?    ...that a Scout getting gibbed has a 1 in 100 chance of spawning a dove flying out of his body?    ...that a #101 Golden Wrench and a #11112 Gentle Manne's Service Medal were given to the winner of a charity auction for Child's Play?    ...that the Ambassador originally dealt mini-crits on headshot rather than full critical hits?    ...that the Flamethrower could not originally perform airblasts before the Pyro Update?"
Got ripped off by a scammer. 10/10 Would trade again.
"Valve have utterly screwed this game. It used to be fun, I used to play it every day. Now I'm playing it less and less and I find I'm no longer missing the game at all.  Each update does one or more of the following: * Prove that Valve simply doesn't play this game anymore and they are not listening to the community at all. * Lower FPS, even to the point where high end systems struggle. (Update on this below) * Break the balance of the game even more. * Introduce a feature that nobody wanted, nobody enjoys. Casual is terrible; I cannot jump into a game my friends are playing, I cannot switch teams to balance the game out, it takes far too long to be matched to a game, and hackers are once again screwing everything for everyone as Valve turned off votekicking (although have since put that little bit back in since). * Remove critical features that made the game fun and enjoyable. * Add more hats/taunts.  The last update actually managed to do ALL of the above.  gg Valve; everyone thought Overwatch or something would kill this game. Turns out it was their creators. Popular TF2 players like Raja, Muselk and Uncle Dane have expressed a lot of concern over this update.  This update is a unilteral failure. If Valve ever listened to this community, they would've rolled back this update as soon as it hit. Nobody had a good thing to say about it.  UPDATE ON FPS ISSUE: During casual mode, I was getting around 15fps. Before the update I was getting nearly 190fps most of the time (although I cap this to 61fps as I have a 60hz monitor and it's just a waste of electric). This made the game literally unplayable for me, as 15fps is garbage, and most 'community' servers (where I could play) are also complete garbage with useless ♥♥♥♥ and plugins all over them.  I run Ubuntu (leave your Windows fanboi comments at the door please), on a i5 Skylake with a GTX 950. Not top of the range at all, but more than enough for TF2.  It wasn't just me. Muselk (a popular TF2 player) tweeted that he was struggling to get 40fps on a GTX 980 TI. And I know he runs Windows. Tweet is here:  https://twitter.com/mrmuselk/status/757802199783133184   Valve recently released an update to the update that solved the FPS problem for me at least. So now I can at least play."
Cool game.
The best hat trading game around.
"So, TF2 eh? This amazing, idiotic, and genuinely crazy FPS is something set out from the crowd. I can almost 100% guarantee that you will NOT find a shooter game even perpetuously close to how insanic this game is. With 9 classes, and probably about 70 unique weapons (Feb 2016), you will never, and I mean NEVER become bored because of all the different class and weapon combinations, be them stupidly over powered, or just flat out derpy. Now you may say: 'Oh yea, CS:GO is better because it has skins!' WELL NO MORE! Because since the Gun Mettle and Tough Break updates came out, ALL the stock weapons have atleast 1 reskin (apart from a few things like the sapper and PDA's). With hundreds of community created content pieces, and regular updates, I'm sure Team Fortress 2 will stay popular for years to come! (PS Valve we better get more free stuff on Scream Fortress and Smissmas this year &gt;:D)"
TF2 is the minority sweatshop I've always wanted to work for. Over 1K hrs crafting apparel. Would suffer through unethical working conditions again!
Played it for a little bit and it's okay.
"i used to love this game, i really did, you can tell by my hours. But with this new update i cant reccomend this game anymore to anyone. I dont feel the need to wait 20 hours to join a game that used to be able to find in seconds.Valve completely ruined tf2. pls volvo  I will update this if they change it."
One of my favorite multiplayer games... and the update ruined it all. Thanks.
"Before the Meet your Match update, this would be an extremely positive review. the gameplay is balanced, its fun, and best of all, it's free. but thanks to the meet your match update, this game is unplayable. and i dont mean its really bad, i mean you literally cannot play. I spent 20 minutes in the queue for a casual game. and for some reason there is a leavers penalty for a casual game. do not waste your time on this game like I have."
"A great game with a ton of replay value. I would not call it perfect, but TF2 is a game that will suck you in and waste your life away in the best ways possible. No two rounds of TF2 are the same, so there is always excitement."
"TF2 is my favorite multiplayer game of all time, just look at my hours.   However, the TF2 team has been tearing apart the things that kept me playing the game for thousands of hours, and with the release of the Meet your Match update, its basically the final nail in the coffin for TF2   They removed all the Valve pubs in favor of one of the ♥♥♥♥♥iest matchmaking services in any game I've ever seen. The 'Casual' mode has leaver penalties, inability to pick the map and gamemode you want to play, and takes an hour to get you into a game where the old system took ~30 seconds   In the face of Overwatch, the TF2 team has been tearing apart the game in the delusional hopes that it'll become a big eSport and stand up against their biggest competitor. In doing so, they've destroyed the thing thats made this game so appealing after almost 10 years. The original charm of the game is dead and gone.   Until the TF2 team gets their ♥♥♥♥ together, and starts realizing what has made this game as undying and long lasting as it is, I wouldnt reccomend touching it."
After 'Neato' update #RIPPUBS
I can`t play the game after the update
"I don't like giving such a great game a bad review. I am doing it because I have played for 2000 hours and it seems like the only way to communicate with Valve is via reviews. They communicate as well as a Tree.  I played the Competitive beta. I did not like it. It seemed half ♥♥♥♥♥, rushed, and filled with problems. I don't like 6 man teams. I don't like the super competitive preassure. I most of all don't like the changed rules that apply even on 'Casual' (i.e. using stopwatch, queueing after every match, no votes to extend/change map, no real choice in maps). Casual is just an unranked version of Competitive.   It seems to me this is the height of arrogance, ramming down a mode that a majority or at least a large segment didn't want. I will reduce my play time and try to support community servers as I can, I am not happy.  This review will stay negative until this is addressed, either by Valve readding pubs or the community adding a lot of vanilla servers (of the latter, I am skeptical)."
"The REAL Casual Mode is Quickplay. Everybody loves quickplay. Most people I see online have spent an accumulative half-year of their lives playing on quickplay. If Valve has a problem with people being THAT dedicated, then I don't reccommend it."
"Its like they dont even care anymore. This game has problems and ♥♥♥♥ it. it crashes for me and! it even has crap updates ie. cosmetics for real $$.  im done with this, lets play overwatch instead.  system specs: intel core i5@ 3.40 ghz 8gb ram 970 nvidia geforce"
"I doubt anybody really needs to be told why to try Team Fortress 2, especially with its reputation and lack of a price tag, but I suppose I should throw my 2 cents in anyway.  Team Fortress 2 is a fun game that gives you fun options in how you want to play. You get 9 classes to toy with, each having an interesting personality and a unique playstyle. Then, as you play, you'll come across weapons that let you experiment within each class's playstyle. The more you play, the more stuff you amass, and the more options you'll have at your disposal. If you haven't already, take a dip into the world of Team Fortress 2. You're almost guaranteed to find something you like!"
"This game is one of the best free to play games I have ever played and would possibly say that it is the best overall game I have played. I do not recommend this game to any Call of Duty player who thinks they are amazing at games just by playing COD. This game will make you angry if you go in hopefull that all of your hours of COD will pay off. They wont. This game is for the adventurous people who enjoy a community based game.  What I enjoy about this game is the fact that you can find weapons from enough gameplay time, the fact you can craft weapons, the achievements, the taunts, how you can install huds and change in game visuals, the range of characters and of course, the taunt kills. The taunt kills give you a sense of achievement when done on an opposing player because they are very hard to do (apart from against lazy snipers).  Overall this game is highly recommended by me and others that I know. I would encourage you to download this game.  - [YT] Zyaxitron Ed"
"Great game, although the balancing team seems like it's made up of monkeys. There are many complaints from the community about balancing classes and weapons that go ignored. Some of the updates, especially recent ones are lackluster. Sometimes, it feels like it's just Valve versus TF2 Community. Also, if anything happens, don't forget to blame Gaben. Edit: Some people also like to blame Jericho."
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjQPaBVYTQk 
"The new update (especially competitive) messes up everything.  If you enjoy fighting warping scouts and bullets that curve around corners, GIVE IT A GO I DARE YOU. Often times players with excessive ping becomes your opponent and that's where the real pain starts. You can't shoot scouts at all, projectiles are almost impossible to deflect and demo charges are unforseeable.  Volvo pls fix"
It's eh. Don't play on valve servers though.
"The new matchmaking system is complete and utter garbage wait hours to get into 1 game, unlike before when you could load into a match instatnly. Please valve remove this crap matchmaking and restore this game to how it was played before. Also not to mention that you cant join friends as you please, you have to make a party and wait to get into a match"
"Dear Valve...  Never change a running system   The update is horrible, it makes the game unplayable.   -The new layout for the lobby is confunsing and unclear -You have to wait way longer than before (srsly you could walk to the next gas station for a beer and when you come back it probably still won't have started) -If you finally could join a game the round might only last 30 seconds, so you'll have to find a new game again since a new game won't start automatically ( and this is frustrating af)"
"as of the 07/07/16 update, i can no longer recommend this game in good faith  the new 'casual' mode is about as far from casual as you could possibly get. hopefully valve realises the mistakes they've made regarding quickplay, and rectifies them soon  community servers were sent to their grave a long time ago, and i'm not about to start trawling the cemetery looking for an ad-free, watermark-free, bot-free, MoTD-free place to play stock tf2 on  "
"Amazing game, best game. Taunts, hilarity, hats, guns, robots, wizards, comics, lore, jumps, movement, rocket launchers, grenade launchers and swords! All this compressed into one single game for you to play, what more can you ask for? c:"
"What can I say about Team Fortress 2 that hasn't already been said over the years? It is an absolutely fantastic game to play with memorable characters, fun yet intense action, an engaging and entertaining backstory, and unique styles of gameplay that is approachable to any kind of gamer."
"♥♥♥♥ game, never play it. Getting my (small) ♥♥♥♥♥ chewed off by a manic piano is more enjoyable then playing this."
Spent 60% of my life with this. Meh...
Imbalanced and runs terrible on computers; artstyle is dead and all people do is get hats.  10/10
"This game has brought joy to me throughout the years. And maybe some extreme rage as well.  This is one of the few games I just can't help but come back to, over and over again. The value of teamwork in this game can be beneficial for hundreds of other games too.  With constant updates, gamemodes, buffs and nerfs, and mostly cosmetic items (And the occasional new weapon that isn't a reskin every fifth major update), the possibilities are endless, as well as the hours you regretfully put into this game.  Learn the different types of players throughout the game, like Free to Play's who frequently play as Pyro and run towards you Flame Thrower blazing, the class mains who ♥♥♥♥♥ about other teammates not doing their job correctly, the friendly players who give you a Sandvich one moment, then unload their Minigun into your back the next, the random who accuses players of hacking but is just terrible, the players who actually do hack and are VAC banned within 30 minutes, and so much more!   There are so many things to this game to like, almost anyone could find something to enjoy.  EDIT: Just some grammar and whatnot."
"Well, If you are a new player then maybe you'll like it. If you are like me, a loyal Valve gamer for at least 10 years or more, I do not recommend this game to anyone any longer!!!! now that they messed up the players choice to choose game play modes and server listings are gone!!!....This game doesn't suck if you give them money...I'm sure. But the $49.99 I paid for the game when it first came out doesn't mean jackshit apparently!!!!"
"I WARNED YOU ABOUT THE UPDATES, BRO.  Edit: IT KEEPS HAPPENING"
"Tf2 was one of my favorite games, I loved playing with my friends. It was so easy to just join a matcch and start playing.  Than, the the update happened. The the meet your match update isn't very welcoming for newer players or players that that just want to play casually. I really don't enjoy having to wait so long for a casual match, and being punished for leaving one."
"tf2 used to be a great game but now the meet your match update has come out everythig has gone downhill, valve you let overwatch win."
"Liked TF2 until the Competetive Update It destroyed Casual... You cant switch teams ( i prefer to be in team Blu) The autobalance is gone and because of that there are so unbalanced teams you cant even think of (4 minutes loosing in cart game)  Then you have to wait so long to get onto a server also you cant search a server anymore like you could before... Why the heck did you touched casual, valve ? Really  TF2 was better before the Competetive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t."
my favorite game of all time
Holy ♥♥♥♥♥ they tried to make this game competitive and now its lost all fun. I wont be returning to this one. What a shame
"Help, I can't stop playing this game."
10/10 would recommend
"vanilla pubs, mann VS machine, communities, trading, weird game modes, custom maps, competitive, source filmmaker, and a ton more. there's a little something for everybody"
"I honestly cannot reccomend this game anymore, with the new modes implemented, I do not have the heart to even open this game anymore. Pub servers have been ruined, with RANKS implemented in CASUAL modes, meaning you have to fully commit to a game, you cannot even choose maps anymore, if you do, you'll have to rely on the private owned ones, which means people can decide on whichever rules they want. It is almost impossible to find a match, I looked for over 20 minutes, and it only said how many servers there are. There is now penalties for leaving a CASUAL match, ruining the sense of causal fun that team fortress 2 had. This is NOT CSGO, but valve has ruined it and made it so, they have successfully killed a game.   EDIT: They fixed the mode selection, as well as the penalty for leaving, but with this. They ruined the pause menu, now only being a lobby for playing. As well as there being no map selsction still. The wait times are leagues longer than before, making it harder to find the patience in order to join the game, let alone play it. The worst part is, the hackers have gotten even worse, with them being more prominent and the report system doing absolutely nothing, I still cannot reccomend it."
"I now have highly mixed opinions on this game.  Here's a list: - Matchmaking: Broke AF - There's a lot more things that I can rant about right now, but I don't have the time to list everything."
Madeline I know you love this game I'm so sorry for peeing in your ramen and stealing the chicken flavoring for myself please take me back!
They actually managed to do it. They killed the game.  I'm not going to wait 20 minutes or more to play CASUAL let alone competitive. And why change pubs in the first place? They worked perfectly fine. The dwindling player base does not allow for queing and is ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious in Australia. I'd rather not play than be placed on a server with 200+ ping.  THANKS VALVE
Best game in the world......
This game is so awsomely good i like playing on fun server's and many more that u can play with your friend's ^-^
"Even after almost 7000 hours, I still think this is a fun and good game. The community is very good and everyone is nice to each other. I have lately been playing a lot of cs:go and its almost always some people that can not behave or be nice to others. In tf2 I almost never meet anyone like that and its much fewer hackers and angry Russians. I`m definitely recommend this game, and hope it will live on for a long time, and that it will keep getting updated and hopefully get a comp update soon."
"IT'S THE END OF DAYS... Casual has disappeared, what's left is a mishmash of comp matchmaking and indoctrination into maps nobody wants to play. I would return to the game if there was a wind-back to pre-update casual. Abolition of casual ranks, authorisation to joining games in progress and freedom of team switching. That way more people would be at will to join the map they want and their friends in progress games and in a fraction of the time... RIP TF2 2007-2016 also bring back Cactus Canyon."
I Wish i had never met my match...
trash the casual mode idea and bring back quickplay. the game is awful without it
Don't want a Pay2Win game? This is the game for you~
Told 8 yo Kiddo to bind mouse1 explode .... He did it  I told him that the way to solve this problem is to bind w explode .. he did it  He was really angry and he was screemin in voicechat so i told him that the way to solve this exploding problem is to bind v explode. He did it :DD 10/5
Im doing this to complete my badges LOL
bring back quick play
"Very good game, one of the best on steam! It's a very fun humor-FPS-action game with many maps and modes. It's pretty different from most other games because you laugh while killing people haha. Graphics are summaries but the overall impression of the game is very positive because you never get bored. There are alot of steam achievements, alot of weapons and objects to create and/or customize. It's very fun to play this game with friends!! Just one problem : there are MANY cheaters... more than in other games probably. However the game stays very nice and fun. As well, you have special maps for Christmas or Halloween for example. Team Fortress 2 was my first game on steam, and even after 330 hours playing it, I still enjoy it!!   83 / 100"
Ruined my life. 10/10
The thing whit this game is that its straight out unique! Its not like all the other FPS out there! The cartoony style is soo charming and the TF2 universe by it self is a must experience! Y'know when your looking for a new FPS game you will most likely find the same boring looking hyper-realistic games out there FX csgo ( I hate that game ) It looks exactly like Call of duty and all the other FPS games out there at first look! And i doubt you can protect man.co against a hodre of raging robots! Or Cast spells and run from giant abominations like Monoculos! And skeletons or take to the moon or stop a raging train for destroying your base! in csgo Anyways! The big fat PLUS whit TF2 is that its open for every bloody one! Thats why its the 2th best F2P game out there! Just look MVM is a good example off how open this game is for everyone! As i've already said before TF2 is a one-of-a-kind game just like the gharial! You do not find another croc that looks like a gharial thats because its unqiue! (Get out false gahrail!) Its weapon variation is also quit big csgo only have 3 diffrent snipers for example! But looks like tf2 got 6 diffrent snipers beat that! Also the classes personality is awesome and they got load of voicelines wich is great! theyr not like the mindless carachacters from other FPS games wich doesn't have depth into their personality! And the teamwork in the game is awesome so it realy lives up to the title 'Team fortress 2' Fx pyros can extinguish team mates and airblast projectiles like rocket and stickies wich is only one off the many choices I could go one forever talking about how fantastic this game is but i'll end it by saying yes this game is totaly worth it!
Catching on with the hate trend. #Volvo #UpdateSuckz #OverWatch #TooExpensiveToBuyOverWatch #NoGamesToPlayAnymore #Blessed
"team fortress 2 is a fun,action paced game base around 9 balanced classes,if you die a lot,its not because of some over powered class or weapons,its probably because u suck. xD"
THIS MAY BE THE MOST AWESOME GAME IN THE HISTORY OF GAMES :O
Splatfest.      That is all I have to say.       Please valve. Why.
4500 hours into this game and I just can't do it anymore. Rest in peace.
I tried to leave.  I tried to warn the others.  I lost all my money and all of my friends to TF2.  I had been left with nothing.  I tried to leave.  I tried to warn the others.  But TF2 always finds you in the end.  You. Cant. Leave.  10/10 would be stuck for an eternity again.
"Want to play TF2, be a shame if the game crashed... So you finally loaded it up without it crashing, be a shame if the game coordinator was down... So you finally waited 10 mins to join a server, be a shame if the map were about to end... So you finally joined a server, be a shame if you were put on the team with 4 snipers that was getting steamrolled... So you finally joined a server but half your team quit, it's a real shame that we removed autobalance and scramble votes... So you finally joined a server with fair teams, be a shame if the game crashed...  Based of true experiences."
Ruined my life 10/10
I wasted my time here
This is one of the best FPS's i've played in a while. Gameplay is well balanced between the classes; Art Direction makes me think 'Has Valve Taken over Pixar?' in a good way; And It is so addicting thanks to the replay value 10/10
"Once bright, got boring after the generalisation of countless useless items and less interesting modes, not to speak of lousier player base (the paywall was nice in that regard and really pushed people to play the game as it should which the passage to f2p spoiled totally in my opinion). Too bad.  Note that I mained medic when I played, maybe it can still be fun if you play other classes, but to me it lost most interest.  Still may be decent for some for a free to play... but it'll never be the game it was ever again. Which is a pity."
I paided some big ol' bucks for this game. Only now do I realize it was free-to-play. Big oops on my part. My bad.
"I've put in monmey for this game. I've put in countless hours into this game. Then here comes the matchmaking update. Apparently this update took some influence from Overwatch. YOU KNOW, ONE THING THAT TEAM FORTRESS DID BETTER THAN OVERWATCH WAS THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE MAPS AND NOW IT'S RIPPED AWAY AND WHY ARE WE PENALIZED FOR LEAVING CASUAL. THIS MATCHMAKING UPDATE HAS REALLY TURNED DOWN TF2. WHAT MADE TF2 FUN WAS THE ABILITY TO FIND A MATCH AND LEAVE WHENEVER I WANTED. QUICKPLAY WAS THE BREAD AND BUTTER OF THIS GAME. IT'S WHAT MADE YOUR GAMES ONE OF THE BEST FREE FPS SHOOTER. Please valve. T^T"
"As of now i can no longer play the game i used to love. Team Fortress 2 is not a dead game, but it is an ignored game by Valve.  With out a doubt the recent Meet your Match update was the absolute WORST in history, worse than Tough Break by a country mile.  First let's talk about the smallest part, the weapon changes, Heavy nerfed AGAIN, useless addition to the Shortstop, zero nerf to the Crit-a-Cola and the fact Valve had to be talked out of BUFFING the Reserve Shooter is outstanding.  Making us choose between the two weakest classes in the game to get a update is another idiotic thing, just buff and fix the both of them we don't need a silly competition.  Next let's talk about how the new casual/comp modes are terrible; the wait time, the negligible punishment for leavers, the amount of hackers and just general terribleness from Casual and Comp is again, outstanding. And the removal of Quickplay is in my mind the BIGGEST mistake Valve has ever made in one of their games.   Good Community servers are few and far between the most heaping pile of trash i've ran into, x10, Minecraft, Trade, Saxton Hale, premium servers the list goes on. And whenever a good community server is found it's completely empty.  The TF2 community needs to make a statement to Valve that we will no longer have our game be worked on 'if they want to' the game needs attention and it needs it now. Overwatch, while not the exact same game as TF2, has enough similarities for people to leave TF2 and start playing that, which is a shame that Valve is just letting one of their biggest and formely best games happen to it.  As of right now, i can't recommend this game in the state it's in. Please Valve, communicate with us, talk to us, we'll give as much feed back as you need. Please Valve don't let TF2 actually die."

Great Game!
"TF2 is probably the best F2P game in the world as it provides both wacky and funny situations or intense, last minute fights. With hundreds of maps and dozens of ways to customize your game, this game truly is, the best F2P game.  So why am I not recommending this game?  Because I can't trust the developers anymore. Since around late 2014, they became lazy and added user-made content ever since. Not user-made original content, just hats. The only gameplay changing aspect they changed was match-making. Nothing since this review was made.  The developers had lost their interest in this game, it's evident really. Lack of communication to playerbase, changes to weapons no one complained about and terrible overall changes in the past few updates.  But in my opinion, what really ruined the game for me was the match-making update. No longer can you join INSTANTLY, yes, you heard me right, INSTANTLY to a map, now (this may depend on where you live, I live in South East Asia) it takes at least 1 MINUTE to get into a match. Their new match making system is worse then the one made YEARS AGO. How do you screw up that badly?  Last but not least, I have seen more and more P2P players leave with more new players joining. The chances of joining a game where most of the players are new and simply doesn't focus on the objective increased so much that most of my matches a few months after the matchmaking update was simply filled with the said F2P players. I have nothing against F2P but if the team is consisted mainly of new players, it simply removes all of the fun.  In my opinion, do not invest any money into this game until the developers show that they can be trusted and they can make tf2 great again. Also wait for the community to recover until then too.  EDIT: Seems that lots of people got extremely triggered over my negative review and tried telling me that my points are irrelavant. Fine, get angry at my review, say all the facts about how 'it's just a 5 man team' or other excuses but I am not changing what I do not like about the game currently and I will continue to defend my opinion about the current state of this game.  Also, writing '♥♥♥♥♥ review' or stuff like that will be deleted because they are not helpful at all."
"This review/rating can be divided into two sections pre/post F2P(June 23, 2011). It is very important to distinguish between these two because they are really two different games.  Pre-F2P TF2 (10/10) - For the first few years of TF2's existence, the game managed to have an absolute killer dynamic with a great playerbase that relied heavily on teamwork and a great community fostered by Valve's friendliness to the modding community. Valve really worked with the community to create new scenarios, maps, and weapons these first few years that helped vastly improve the game.   Post-F2P TF2 (5/10) - The easiest way to describe the state of the game today would be a male dress-up Barbie simulator. I don't fault Valve for trying to capitalize on a game that is at the time of this writing over 7 years old, but the best times for this game are now well past. There's just too many new hats and new weapons to choose from, from which the majority are useless. Sure there are still plenty of servers to play in, but the majority of the servers are devoid of players with skill, microphones, and teamwork. There's still a few fun servers (see the No-Heroes servers) but donating is about the only way you will be able to see the inside of one of these servers when its full. The only bright side is that Valve is still adding new content with multiple updates a year."
"It's taken over my life. If you're reading this, it means I'm dead and I want you to have all my hats  jk  I would never give my hats away"
Best free FPS game with a twist.... and hats.
"I take it all back. This game is seriously just too overrated as heck. Originally this game was supposed to be fun, engaging to players (both new, experienced and old) and was meant to appeal to the gaming community, but ever since the recent major updates, this game has been making players give in to purchase various items, and has only let most of the community down with unexpected results, as these are mainly 'stolen' or even 'borrowed' ideas from other Valve-related games, such as the popular FPS, Counter Strike: Global Offensive.  This game hardly, if ever, lets the community have their own way with custom community-created content, be it weapons, taunts, or even cosmetics. Valve ALWAYS implements their own attributes, soundtrack, and even appearances to simply 'balance' gameplay, when in fact, the results are honestly not worth the wait, and are not what the community is expecting to see, use or even, hear.  To those thinking this is a great game: in my opinion, it's no longer attractive to play this game anymore. TF2's simply a giant money vacuum, 'sucking' in your wallets and “baiting' unexpected players into purchasing mainly unused items that are simply just for show, and not for actual use, unless you aren't easily appealed into buying these 'excess' items.  Valve, please, at the very most, whenever an update’s in the works, ALWAYS have the community in mind. Your actions may bring about unforeseen circumstances, which only spread outcry over the whole community, be it the inclusion of a new weapon, changing the statistics of a weapon, or even changing the gameplay of various classes. With your recent update, this even brings in unpopularity among players who have played this game throughout the past few years, with unnecessary or unpopular content that is simply redundant, and only brings in unexpected responses or reactions from the community. "
"This game is the best free to play game ever in the planet.  Fun and with good rewards!!!  Extra fun if u play with friends, i recommend it to all of you.  The rank i am going to give to that game is unusually one of the best :P  10/10 would play again with more friends and enjoy it all the time"
If you only play one team based game play his one.
"I'm close to a whole year of gameplay in TF2, it has to be for something, right? and the reason is... because the game is fun, is amazing, it has so many great game modes mades by the game and the community, and yes, I have wasted a lot of money on hats and those kind of things, but you don't need to waste any cent to enjoy this game. If I have wasted more than 5000 hours of my life playing this game is for a good reason, this game is pure gold, and I love it as much as my hats."
"You'll think this game doesn't look appealing because of it's graphics and gameplay? Well i'd tell you this; you've got to give it a chance by playing it for like 5 hours, try out all the game modes and try out all the custom modes made by the community.   After 4 years of playing this game is absolutely amazing. Not only because of it's high amount of comic and hilarious scenes, but also for it's original graphics, gamemodes, characters and much more.  The 9 different characters in this game makes Team Fortress 2 so unique. For instance, it's tons of fun playing as the Spy character. This very unique character can go completely invisible against other online players. This one of the reasons I liked this game so much when I was 14. The ability to go invisible is one of Team Fortress 2's many appealing reasons to play it. By going invisible you can have tons of fun by playing around with it and using clever tactics with it.   Are you bored after a few hours? No problem, you just switch to another character within a split second! Let's take the Soldier character, it's equipped with a huge rocket launcher on his shoulder which can obviously fire rockets. Something also very unique and great scripting is that you can 'rocketjump' with the rockets you fire. You shoot them at your feet, and you'll get launched away! This is just also very great and really amuzing! You'll spend hours and hours mastering those 'rocketjumps'. And is also a great reason to keep on playing Team Fortress 2.  These were just 2 of Team Fortress 2's unique characters. These are all characters other First person shooter games don't have. This is one of the biggest reasons to try out this incredible game.  Also something every First person shooter doesn't have, is that all the weapons are completely free! Reason why is that you 'find' them all eventually! You just play with your stock weapon at first until a screen pops up and says 'You have found a new weapon!' And poof, you've got one of TF2's 1000 weapons in your inventory, all shiny and ready to get played with. All weapons have their unique ability which can be great fun and tactical.  Besides shooting rockets, grenades, blasting out fire and shooting a billion bullets a minute, there is also a whole different part of Team Fortress 2. And that's trading your items. Team Fortress 2 comes with a very unique trading system. You can trade your weapon you just found for something else via another online player. Beside weapons there are also a thousand hats for all your TF2 characters. So you can enjoy TF2 even more by dressing your characters either very fancy, scary, classy, funny or whatever you want!  For anyone who wants a unique game, this is it. Free to play for everyone, so get it now i'd say!"
If you want the experience play on a Valve Pub at first not other ones as they may have mods like x10.  Besides that though don't go complaining about Engineer relying too much on his buildings. It's what he was meant to do! Oh and don't complain about other classes then yours being OP half the time since they are more likely a higher skilled player than you. That's just my opinion.
"A game that was good, has been ruined by new mechanics, I enjoyed this game because of how non-competitive it was, i spent more than 2000 hours on this game now i hardly play it because of the new update, some weapons totally useless now. "
this has been my life for almost 2 years.
"This game at one point in time was my favorite game in existance. It had a great appeal, great fanbase, and great support from the company that made it.  Now? Not so much. Valve got greedy and started shoving unnecessary ♥♥♥♥ into it and didn't take anything the community requested into account.   They stopped producing their own content and now they just outsource all their work to the community to make for them, and even though they don't make any of the new ♥♥♥♥ that goes into the game they take a huge ♥♥♥ cut out of it.  They also added in a competitive system which just makes me even more depressed at the state of the game and the sheer lack of care Valve as a whole has for this game I spent 4 years of my life supporting.  I seriously do not recommend this game. The golden years are far gone. :(   Adding in a further rant from the comments:  I have absolutely no burnout of the gameplay itself. Overwatch has pretty similar hectic gameplay and I've played the hell out of it the last 3 months. I come into TF2 expecting to have a good time and I look around and I have a competitive system with no placement matches, meaning whenever I'm put into a 'competitive' game I'm essentially faced with a free-for-all cluster♥♥♥♥. I'm also faced with casual, which is also a free-for-all cluster♥♥♥♥ because of the area-denial of the engineer and the 15 people who just installed the game. One of the actual havens where I could play with players of my actual skill level, community servers, was directly killed by Valve, so where the ♥♥♥♥ am I supposed to go now? (Answer: Somewhere else, and I have.)  Also does not help that valve overall does not give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about TF2. There's a small group of people who come in occasionally to ♥♥♥♥ with the TF2 community and port in ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from their other games (why the ♥♥♥♥ do we have skins, the weapon market is a cluster♥♥♥♥ enough as it is without them) and occasionally add in community items so they can milk as much as possible from that cash cow.... but nothing really else.  At one point there was also a sense of 'magic' to their updates. Hell, even EotL had that magic despite the disappointment it was. What did we get this year? A halloween event with nothing really new other than a couple community maps (for the second year in a row), the disappointing Meet Your Match which we found took absolutely no one's suggestions into consideration, and at the tail end of last year we got Tough Break which probably had the last drop of any sort of the past magic that I had come to expect from TF2 updates.  So there. Here's my rant."
"iz best game evr. Hats, guns, poni, and shiz. Play nao, luv gaem."
"You were good son, real good. Maybe even the best.. October 9 2007 - July 2 2015"
Stupidly fun.
"You don't get a real appreciation for the game until you play competitive medic. Not this Match Making nonsense, that full on ♥♥♥♥ on your chest bombed by the roamer and ♥♥♥♥♥ by a mid air rocket. You don't get a real appreciation for the game until you play competitive sniper. Not this pub ♥♥♥♥, that full on ambassador headshot accross the map only to be tickled in the stomach by the scout that your team didn't see so you cry yourself to sleep for being relied on and not dropping the med, that Vietnam flashback ♥♥♥♥. You don't get a real appreciation for the game until you play competitive Demo. Not that sticky spamming tard on pubs, I'm talking about that guy that has to stick with the combo so that your 150 health anal explorer of a medic doesnt die. Yeah... that's the sort of ♥♥♥♥ im talking about."
'Game so good that it will ruin your life.'  A+++++++++++++++++++ WILL GET LIFE RUINED AGAIN
"There's many reviews on how this game can destroy your social life and such , i can guarantee it's 100% true.      11/10"
"You get hats. You sell hats for more hats. It is a vicious cycle.  Once you get more hats, you sell those. For more hats. Hats are everywhere. All hail Gaben, the lord of Savings. All hail Valve, the lords of Hats."
"Initially interesting and fun game turned bloated, cluttered, unbalanced and sloppily-made cash cow."
It's ok i guess
"I'm playing TF2 since 2010 and still enjoy it. First of all one most important thing about it: it's 10x more fun when you play with friends. Here's my top 10 reasons why I love that game:  1 You don't need to be great at multiplayer FPS games (CS, Quake 3, UT etc.) to be good at TF2, of course skill, reaction and good aim helps, but as long as you know your role and if you're playing it smart you're gonna be just fine and there's always something you can figure out or learn to turn things to your advantage.  2 It has one of the best and most hilarious characters with hundreds of lines and a lot of space for random accidents that make me lol really hard even after playing it for three years. The humor in this game is great and it never gets old.  3 A well crafted balance between teams and classes and really great maps. Unlike most games with good balance this one doesn't make you feel underpowered and pressured to be a real pro or die as a noob in shame (I'm looking at you Starcraft), when you start to do things right you start to feel how powerful your class is, that feel that by doing simple things you're supposed to do is bringing the glorious victory of your team closer every passing second is priceless.  4 Complexity in simplicity: each class has a simple purpose and just few simple tools to accomplish it. The complex gameplay of TF2 is made of very simple concepts, like 'rocket launchers hurt people', 'if you get an ubercharge you can use it and make yourself and the guy you're healing invulnerable and push through heavy resistance', 'airblast - alternate fire of your flame thrower, is pushing things away, players, rockets and even arrows, also it extinguishes allies and saves them from burning to death', 'spies may look like one of your teammates, but act suspiciously, smack their face with your wrench' and one more simple thing most new players are having a hard time to figur out for some reason: 'engies can actually help other engies to build and defend!'  5 there are no weak or powerful weapons, most weapons are the same as your default weapons except they are slightly better in something and a bit worse in other thing. You don't need to know the entire arsenal of the game, you just need to find the weapons that are most appealing to your playstile. Also there are a few weapons change the way you play, like engie's gunslinger, you can't build big fat and mean sentries, you build a small mini-sentry, however equipping that thing gives you HP boost, and makes you a mobile obnoxious prick who runs around and builds and instantly deploys those annoying mini sentries whenever he feels like.  6 Most items are cosmetic, that means you don't need to have any hats, high level or money spent in game's store to be effective, some weapons that will amplify your strong traits would be a good addition though and those are very easy to get. Also despite those cosmetic items thanks to the good character design all classes are very distinguishable, you always know what to expect from a fat guy with a minigun and you always know you should kill the dude in white coat because he heals others. Still you can get some cosmetic items and look badass or funny.  7 The game is constantly updated, every now and then you get new maps, modes, bug fixes, balance fixes, weapons and cosmetics. Sadly Valve gets more lazy and greedy with each new major update and makes more hats rather than real content.  8 They got it right with graphics. I remember playing other modern FPS games and that was terrible! All those 'eye candy' effects, strong contrasts, 'cinematic' camera movement, 'realistic shaders/lighting/effects, poor character design and 'spectacular' explosions were very distracting and were making it really hard to tell what's going on before it would be too late.  9 It's all about teamplay and mission goal rather than killcount and skill. A team of average players who help each other will always be stronger than a team of disorganized show-offs with mad skillz who play their favorite class even when the team needs a medic and engie and don't care about anything but their killcount.  10 Valve puts a lot of effort each year to make the Haloween event in TF2 very VERY awesome.  However there are things I don't like in TF2:  1 Community. LOTS of obnoxious kids, trolls, pretentious jerks and total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  2 Trading. I hate it, I really-really hate it.  3 Painfully stupid people. This game introduced me levels of stupidity I couldn't even imagine.  4 Bugs. There are some really annoying gameplay and performance issues with the game and Valve pretends really hard that everything is cool.  5 Cheaters. Sometimes there will be some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who will ruin everyone's game by flying through walls and spawncamping with 100% accuracy and 100% crits. However there are some guys who use not so obvious hacks and claim they knew where you were and hit you from an impossible angle and distance for ten times in a row just because they are so good at this game and you're a stupid butthurt noob.  6 Server customization. Finding a server that has good ping, vote menu enabled, good map list and doesn't have custom music, idiotic settings like instant respawn, ads or other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t are very hard to come by.  Hope this was helpful."
[insert joke about not having life here]. [insert joke about hats here]. #steamreviews.
change tf2 back to what it used to be before meet your match.
"Do not get me wrong this game is very fun and enjoyable but these new updates really had an impact. That impact was bad. First of, MYM was the update that removed Valve servers which was something almost the whole TF2 community loved. Competitive takes at least 6-8 mins to join a server due to the fact not many people play competitive. I'm sorry but this update was bad. If Valve does decide to make a better update lets hope its worth it"
better than overwatch
"I've put far too many hours into this game. I got really good, pubstomped a lot, made a lot of friends, and had an overall great time. Definitely THE best f2p game out there. If this was 3 years ago, I would've easily recommended this game. But now, I don't know if I can, despite its greatness. A few things to note: -The hitreg is VERY ♥♥♥♥y. -There are a fair amount of netcode issues with the game. -Its hard to get into competitively. -It is now EXTREMELY BLOATED. The first 3 are obvious, but I'd like to talk about my last point for a minute.  Valve has milked this game for all it's worth, and rightly so, they've made huge profit off this game. But they pushed it a little TOO far with the path they've taken with this game. It's extremely bloated, I get really bad frames, which is odd considering I can get atleast 100 fps on GTA V with near max settings, but I barely get 100 on lowest in TF2. They've made the game run like crap with the copious amounts of cosmetics and weapon skins. It's stupid, and has made the game nearly unplayable.   Tf2 used to run pretty good, and I had a good time with it. The game will forever hold a place in my heart. But it runs like trash, has gotten very stale from the lack of REAL content (note real: not skins or hats) and ValvE has humped this game till it bled, and it shows. I can't say the community is healthy either. The economy for items went down the drain as well.  I really can't recommend this game for anything more than quick enjoyment. I loved this game, but I really can't look at in the same light anymore.  TL;DR- Game is good, but runs bad, has a diminishing community, bad hitreg/ netcode, Valve has milked it for all it's worth. I used to love it, now I cannot. "
"I simply can no longer recommend this game. I have played 3,000 plus hours (Sad, I know.) of TF2 and for the longest time I thought a replacement would never come. Even when it did (namely Overwatch) I immediatly discredited OW as a cheap knock-off by Blizzard. Even now I still haven't gotten my hands on Overwatch (At the time of this Review I have a poor quality computer). But I can't help but not be able to look at TF2 in the same, untouchable light anymore. Popular leaders of the Team Fortress community have given up on the game, STAR_, Jerma985, and A_Seagull to name a few, In their stead cheap, two-bit, unfunny, knock-offs have taken their place King Raja, Red Robot, Muselk (though I have nothing against these people I feel as though the quality of content by comparision to previous tf2 content creators is heavily watered down.) Aswell as Delfy and Nislt (or SiN) being people who edit tf2 'funny' moments, I find it saddening that Montage/Funny Moment 'Creators' (Something which I regard as a very low and lazy form of entertainment) are highly regarded and very prominent people in the TF community. But I digress, poor content creators doesn't make a game bad, however, the community seems no better. The popular thing to do amidst tf2 players (Not all of them, I am no saying that) is to religiously protect tf2 and blindly hate on Overwatch. If you doubt the legitimacy of this claim you need only look in the comment section of a Nislt video titled 'PSA: Overwatch on NISLT' and you will understand. We seem to have fallen to the status of children not wanting to get rid of their favorite toy, despite it being ruined and broken, only for the reason of what it once was. I look around TF nowadays and see video game elitists, who think TF is the best thing ever, and ever questioning that isn't even concievable. I deeply loved this game it took up a massive portion of my time on the internet (I wouldn't have put 3,000 hours into it if I didn't like it) but it has fallen from grace and has been that way for close to 2 years. Valve no longer cares about this game, that is very clear to me, I personally believe it is beyond redemption. I have only played a match or two of Overwatch on a friends computer but already I see the work, dedication, polish, and time Blizzard has put into it (As they do with practically all games they make). I greatly look foward to playing a game with an active, positive, and responsive community, one in which the developers care about the game, it's community, and community feedback. whereas I look at tf2 nowadays and I see lazy attempts at updates, broken weapons, fights being left to the chance of random crits, glitches and exploits that 'Content Creators' show the masses (Yet another reason to dislike Nislt and Delfy), Video game elitists, Overly Loyal Fan-boys, and a nearly non-existant 'team' of lazy Devs. who cannot communicate, and have proven time and again that they dont know their own game (I am aware that normal tf2 players exist, ones who are none of these things, but those who are vocal about the game fit alot of these). I advise you to form an opinion on the game yourself, but I thought I would put my opinion out there regardless."
All-around fun game.
Hats are love. Hats are life.
"This used to be an excellent game that I would recommend to any gamer who wanted a nice distraction.   While it would be great if that were still true, it is not, not even close. The player base has decreased dramactically in quality, a trend which is not at all helped by Valve's unbelievably stupid decision to blast out updates at peak player population times. It is so very frustrating to both players and server communities to have a random update come out at 7:00-9:00pm EST and suddenly a server that was completely full be emptied within minutes for the smallest of updates. Many updates come one day after another as Valve fixes a couple bugs here and there, usually creating four or five more in doing so, showing an absolutely abysmal lack of aptitude in testing their own content.  I know I have a LOT of hours, both in general and over the last two weeks, but that's only because I happen to manage WYD's TF2 servers. If not for that, this game wouldn't even exist in my library, I'd have sold out and gotten out. Unless if Valve can pull their heads out of their ♥♥♥♥ and see what they're doing to the game with what they're adding, there is no way TF2 will recover. ANY development of new games seems to be completely absent from the corporate minds, a death sentence for any game.   Save yourself the hair pulling and play a game where the devs actually give a crap about catching cheaters and care to interact with their community. At this point Valve has updated TF2 into spaghetti code, every time they fix one thing, another breaks, and with their testing (or seeming lack thereof) that means the old quality shooter we know and love will never come back."
Almost as good as Overwatch.

Cool! And it's free!
"Team Fortress 2 is a game release by our favourite company, Volvo and as of today a successful and active game. I say active because unlike most games made by Volvo, TF2 gets patched frequently as well as some updates such as the Gun ettle Update, Smissmas, Halloween and much more. Before 2011, TF2 was a purchasable game for $40 but they made the game free forever.  The presentation of this game is cartoonish which for most people looks stupid but once u get used to the graphics. Even then i see the environment a bit messed up such as the rocks not being smooth. I personally feel like Volvo should fix this to make the environment smooth. The gameplay is the most interesting and is the reason thousands of people are playing the game right now. There are 9 classes to play as such as the Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy. Each class holds a weapon specifically for them such as the Soldier using a Rocket Launcher and the Demoman using a grenade launcher. Every class has 3 weapon slots which is Primary,Secondary and Melee weapons. Many people rely on their Primary weapon however classes like the Spy and Scout are better with a melee Weapon. Another big thing with every class is that u can unlock other kinds of weapons as your playing the game and unlocking achivements. Some weapons are pretty much reskins of the default weapons but others have pros and cons such as the Heavy`s Brass Beast which does more damage but takes a while to deploy. TF2 also has cosmetics ranging from head to toe. There are MANY diffrent kinds of cosmetics for each class. You can either craft hats or unbox them from crates which are also dropped time to time. Speaking of crafting, you can craft weapons to make metal or another kind of weapon thats useful for you.  Another thing about TF2 that makes it fun is the variety of modes. There are as of now 8 diffrent types of modes excluding Random. There are modes such as Capture the Flag, Attack/Defense, Payload and much more. There are even maps created by the community themselves such as Suijin, Mountain Lab, Turbine and much more.  I give this game 10 out of 10 because despite this game coming out in 2007, it is still an enjoyable game to play with friends. This game has improvement by a lot ever since its launch If you have a mic and NOT a squeaking voice, u may actually make some new friends throughout Steam just watch out for scamers."
"I guess it's allright. I've owned this since 2010 and I still find myself coming back.  Good things:  - free updates - free to play - free item drops - a semi functional economy - a very high skill ceiling - class diversity and difference in roles - custom maps and gamemodes  - a vast array of weapons for each class, enabling different playstyles - character customization (at certain expense) - Pootis  - good amouns of fresh players to crush - people who take the game too serious and get upset easily - competitive game modes - airshots - meatshots - there's a class where you can win by clicking on things, aka the sniper - if you've ever played Quake 3, the soldier is just right for you - people who believe thier skill is defined by thier cosmetic appearance  Bad things:  - with every update the game suffers poorer optimization (I need a maxframes config to run tf2 smoothly) - recent updates have been repetitve and bland (paid campaigns like gun mettle) - a massive amount of script kiddies using 20$ aimbots (lmaobox) - an ungodly amount of cringey fandoms like bronies and fnaf kids - free to play users with no game sense usually having a negative impact on the entire team - people who invest hundreds of $$$ on expensive items, only to be as terrible as free to plays - kids who believe they're top Memers when they spam lenny binds in chat - ungodly amounts of salt - guys pretending to be girls to beg for items (yes thirsty virgins fall for ♥♥♥♥ like that) - abusive admins, usually abusing powers when bested in combat - some of the many weapons are quite unbalanced  - nsfw sprays - some ingame items are worth over 1000$ (honestly why) - classes like engineer and pyro - kids who micspam with potato quality microphones - kids who micspam meme related music again thinking they're top memers  10/10 would reccomend to anyone   "
Ruined my life. 10/10
What else is there to say about this game other than lot's of fun and exilarating moments?
it's alright i guess  i recommend it because somehow i ended up with a virtual hat worth $50
The hats are good.
"Easily one of the greatest FPS games ever made. Not only has it stood the test of time, it has done so whilst being free-to-play, and brushing off Triple-A titles to remain in the top 10 most played games on Steam year after year.  However, every gem has its flaws, and TF2 pub matches can often contain cheaters, griefers and generally bad people. Not to mention the frustration of having people on your team with no genuine clue of what they're doing.  This game is chaos with the potential for beautiful order (ie 12 Heavies pushing the cart) and I would not give it up for anything. Also, sparkly hats."
"my game crashes when i joined a comp game[ hasnt even started yet] i get back onto the game.  no option to rejoin, just a 6 hour ban. fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck you valve. update: game crashes again at the end of a comp match and i now have a 24 HOUR BAN, im done valve, you give no ♥♥♥♥♥ about your customers, ♥♥♥♥ you. update: happened again, valve still doesnt give a ♥♥♥♥ so i guess im not giving these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s any of my money until they fix it. ♥♥♥♥ you valve"
I love this game
I wasn't even playing this game...
"Uhhh, I don't have much to say about the game, other than some parts of the game require more skill than others. I'm kinda just writing this for the community badge, soooooo.... Team Fortress 2 is a good game. 10/10 IGN."
"I dunno, I guess I can't really recommend it anymore.   TL;DR, it used to be a good game to play with friends.  Now it's just another competative multiplayer.  Valve really screwed up in that they put a throttle on the creativity and fun of the game, and laid out the rules as 'here's what you do, and how you do it.' I don't particularly think TF2 was ever meant to be like this, and if Valve themselves said that this was their original dream of the game, I wouldn't believe them. It just seems too inline with Valve's other big products, more than the whimsical Team Fortress mentality."
Welcome to the just play Overwatch update.
I recommend this game. It is good.
"First off, I want to start by saying that I have had quite a lot of experience with this game, and all the different mechanics in it, which make it very interesting. TF2 really isn't just your ordinary shoot-and-run game, it has much more to it than just aiming a gun and pressing M1. The classes are what really make the game stand out of the crowd, they are the main focus of the game, so I'll cover that!  Classes are divided in to three different types, offensive classes, defensive classes and support classes. I'm going to go through all of the different classes and their purposes in the game.  OFFENSIVE CLASSES: The Scout: He's fast and effective at doing objectives. Double jumps and speed make him move quite unexpectedly. He might be fast and do good damage, but he is quite weak. Equipped with a scattergun, a pistol, and a baseball bat.  The Soldier: He's slow, but deals quite a big splash damage with his rockets. He has quite a lot of health so he can take quite big hits as well. Equipped with a rocket launcher, a shotgun, and a shovel.  The Pyro: It's quite self explanatory with the name. Pyro does a lot of damage with it's close range flame thrower, and can also airblast enemy projectiles (rockets, grenades, sticky bombs). Equipped with a flame thrower, a shotgun and a fire axe (ironically)  DEFENSIVE CLASSES: The Demoman: He is a drunk black scottish man with one eye. Demoman is the class who uses explosives, much like the Soldier. He can also take a big hit, but not as well as the Soldier. Equipped with a grenade launcher, a stickybomb launcher (the bombs stick to walls, and are detonatable) and a bottle.  The Heavy: A big man, with a big gun and a big Russian accent. He's the most tanky class in the game, and has a freaking minigun. Be wary though, he is very slow, and usually depends on having a Medic. Equipped with a freakin' minigun, a shotgun and his bare freakin' fists. You really wouldn't want to mess with him.  The Engineer: He's one of the more unique classes in the game, he can build an automatic sentry gun that shoots at enemies, a dispenser which gives him and teammates health and ammo and a teleporter to get your comrades faster to the frontlines. When an engineer is good, it is a game changer definitely. Equipped with a shotgun, a pistol, a wrench and a construction- and destruction PDA.  SUPPORT CLASSES: The Medic: He's the one who is responsible of keeping the whole team alive, and you should definitely protect him. He's a german doctor, who might be a bit on the crazy side... Equipped with syringe gun (ouch), a medi gun (a gun that is used to put a healing beam on your teammates) and a bonesaw.  The Sniper: He can quite easily pin down key enemy targets like heavies from a long distance, but is also quite weak, and vulnerable to Spies. This Australian man is effective in long range, but starts to get less effective when in close range combat, since the Sniper doesn't have much health. Equipped with a sniper rifle, an SMG, and a kukri.  The Spy: A lady killer (figuratively) and a man killer (literally). The spy is a stealth class who can get behind enemies, turn invisible, disguise as other players, disable and destroy Engineer buildings and effectively kill unaware enemies with one stab in the back. Definitely one of the more interesting classes. Equipped with a revolver, a butterfly knife, a disguise kit, an invisibility watch and a sapper.   I would also like to point out that this game has had an unusually long lifespan! It's been over 7 years since the release of the game, and people still play this actively! A̶l̶t̶h̶o̶u̶g̶h̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶e̶c̶o̶n̶o̶m̶y̶ ̶h̶a̶s̶ ̶w̶e̶n̶t̶ ̶d̶o̶w̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶s̶h̶i̶t̶t̶e̶r̶.  I was thinking of typing about the different types of unlockable weapons in the game, but this is already a really long review in itself, so I'll let you guys look into them yourselves.  If you want to play an FPS-shooter that's out of the norm, TF2 would definitely be something I would recommend. It's free and fun.  Phewh. It's been quite a job writing all this. Lastly I would like to state that this is my favourite game of all time, and I hope you guys found this review interesting and or helpful! Go out and play this awesome game (for free). Peace."
"This game has survived thousand updates but this time Valve killed it. It has been the only work day in few years when me and my colleagues could not play 'the mid-day match'. When company had strict firewall we ran our server in the lan. Whatever happened the game was always at the same time. If you do not want to be able to select a server, a game mode, a map or join your friend this is your multiplayer gameplay circa 2016 by Valve. RIP TF2 July 8, 2016"
"I can't no longer. Like everyone else is saying: This update have killed TF2. Over 4000 hours, and this...is the End of the Line. No more quickplay, no more pubs, no more chosing teams, overall, no more fun. Its with a breaking heart, that i have to write this, as i really used to love this game. But i can't get used to it, and i don't want to get used to it. I want the good old pubs back, where you can come and go as you please, and choose what team you're on...not this freaking CS:GO copy!"
"Let me just tell you, this game is euphoric. From the free to play novices donning their wonderful gibuses and mercenary badges with dates less than a month prior, to the phlog pyros, to the 8 snipers on a payload offense, all the way down to 5   Pleb-Tier   spies pursuing a single heavy for 10 minutes. All of this just draws you in via amazement. All of the 9 classes in the game and dozens and dozens of weapons are simply there to pull in you in for the real purpose of the game. Hat simulation. After playing the game for a few months you are bound to purchase more than just the 5 dollars you wasted to get a premium account, now you are beginning to put yourself in debt as there was a sunbeams fedora on the market that you had to have, in order to attain maximum euphoria alongside your fellow brony  ♥♥♥♥♥♥   friends. Although the review has indeed been negative to this point, you will meet some amazing people and experience some wonderful moments along the wanderlust that is TF2 and by the end of the road you will have over 3k hours clocked and have over 2 thousand of your parents dollars logged in cancerous unusuals. I am just a lone wanderer in the massive journey that is,  Team Fortress 2 ."
cool hat simulator
Ive been here since...  Lets say. A long time. And now? Its ♥♥♥♥.  I really dont know what else to say. They killed the game i loved to play.  rip 2012-2016
No. The new update is beyond terrible. Don't even bother downloading it at this point.
"I could have slit my throat or drank bleach instead of wait an hour to join a game. Valve, I'm not playing until you put back Valve servers and remove that 'Casual' thing. Everything was fine until this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ update came along. Overwatch is gonna get Thirty Thousand more players now. Just stick to CS:GO, people."
"This is ♥♥♥♥ing tragic, if I wanted to play overwatch I'd buy it  RIP pubs"
great game all thing about it are just the best
"So, Team Fortress 2 is a game that is free to play and offers a fun user experience to people of a large age range. TF2 gives players the choice to play with friends and have a good laugh, or even take it to the next level with competitive gaming. One thing which I love about team fortress 2 is that almost everyone is happy to play with you and that some items in the game are created by our online community. This gives people the chance to display their own creations and hopefully bring them to life in game.   TF2 is more of a relaxed game and does not require you to be good at first person shooters. This is because there is a class suited to every style of play. If you prefer to stealth and be hidden, then the spy is for you. However, if you having a bad day and you cant concentrate, why not throw out some flames with the pyro's flamethrower which requires no practice to use.  There is also a large amount of different gamemodes on TF2 such as pushing a large bomb into the enemys base or even sending a rocket into space. If your a relaxed person looking for a bit of fun with a game that is not full of try harding people... then tf2 is definatly for you!  I highly recomend it :) Happy gaming"

"TF2 Meet its Match in the 'Meet Your Match' update. And when I mean Meet its Match, I meant Meet its End. TF2 is dead. RIP Oct 09, 2007-July 07, 2016 You were real good son, maybe even the best."
valve valve valve the uptade ISSSSSSS so bad ur not even allowed 2 leave the match VALVE FIX IT I would give it a better review before the uptade valve u just LOST a player
"Thanks Valve. You took a game, which I had put  1 thousand, 7 hundred ♥♥♥♥ing hours  into, and ruined it completely. Removal of pubs, penalties for leaving 'casual' play and an obvious focus on imitating Overwatch's competitive success, you have sucked all the fun out of this game, forcing us to turn to usually awful community servers to relive the old TF2 experience. I have played competitve TF2 before, in ETF2L, and I can say, this game was not meant for competitive play. However Valve tries to balance it, all attempts will fail, as the huge amound of class sidegrades and weapons is impossible to balance. If you're an old player of TF2 thinking of returning to relive the old days of fun with this update, I regret to inform you, the old TF2 is dead."
"Finally an FPS with Color! This game has been eating away at my life lately! 9 UNIQUE classes, each with their own different weapons. Sounds simple on paper, but In reality it adds up to so much fun! The controls are tight, music is wonderful, and the art style is impressively different. The best part is... It's all free!"
11/10 Best hat simulator for 7+ years in a row.
"I love children. Tf2 is full of children. I love tf2.   would reccomend to friends and family, 28/27"
"Very nice and addictive game. What I like about TF2 is that it is different from most FPS shooters, it's not your traditional military themed game, it's more cartoon-ish and not realistic and I absolutely love that fact. I recommend it to people that are looking for a FPS game that is not too realistically-military themed. The only thing I do not like however is that it's slowly turning into a dress up game and a hat simulator. Other than that, very addictive and good game."
"A sniper dot appears on the wall next to you. before you can ever turn to find the sniper, it is between your eyes. The last thing you see in life is a man, modest straw hat, skull on his veil, and wearing a robotic tracking system, and then it all ends."
"It's been said that Team Fortress 2 has characters where other FPS games merely have classes. I fell in love with those nine wacky mercenaries and their Cold War satire universe through Valve's Meet the Team videos and online art, then I stayed for the gameplay.   TF2 was the first multiplayer game ever where, when I stumbled across footage of a Scream Fortress Halloween event and a Smissmas event in late 2011, I instantly fell in love with the game design. I knew I had to play this game, despite never having played a multiplayer FPS before that and hardly able to make sense of what I was seeing.   I saw a middle-aged German man dressed in a Mad Scientist labcoat with a Ghostbusters-style proton pack on his back, healing people with an energy beam and by shooting them with a crossbow. I knew I wanted to play as the Medic, I wanted to be Ghostbusters Guy. I saw a big Russian handing out sandwiches and tickle-punching people with woolen gloves to make them laugh. I saw a Frenchman wearing a papermask on his face who could go invisible, sneaking around a battlefield dressed in a pinstripe suit and tie. I saw a guy in a too big helmet rocketjump around the place, and some jumpy mouthy boy in a bunny ears hat beating people up with a dead fish. This was so deliciously bizarre and eccentric, quite unlike all those boring “military” shooters I had seen before.  Yet for a while I forgot about the game (as I said, I didn’t play FPS games back then), but it still stayed in the back of my mind, so I decided to look it up again. When the 2012 Scream Fortress event drew closer, I spent a full month in the TF2 Wiki, learning all I could about the game, and then weeks in the training servers, because I wanted to be ready. I missed the Pyromania event by a mere two weeks.   Team Fortress 2 has the most amazing and creative fan community inside and outside the game. It has given birth to countless official modes and custom game modes and spin-offs, its own e-sports community, big annual charity events, fan comics and short movies. TF2 brought together custom mappers, 3D modellers, SFM film creators, fan voice actors, fan artists, cosplayers, fanfiction writers, and spawned several pop culture memes.   And after nine years the game is still going strong, despite its ups and down, aided by Valve's decision to allow community servers and community-created content updates and to add a Steam Workshop for community-created virtual items, in-game animations and custom maps. Nor to mention the highlight of the TF2 year, its annual Halloween Event.  Here’s to all the Engineers relaxing with a cold beer after a day of building sentries. Don’t forget to look behind you for Spies. Beep bleep bloop, maggots!"
"Valve should have never taught their players to play like they do. Nowadays and with valve wanting to stick TF2 into the e-Sport desires of people, valve wanted to create their own 'competitive' gamemode, including all the stuff people wanted to avoid when they would go play competitive gamemodes, if people go and play actual competitive gamemodes, they are confused and upset they are not supposed to actually consider demoknight their 'main', they are upset they cant cheese their way through control points with a stun + cleaver combo, they are upset they cannot play all the garbage valve implemented into TF2 for years.  For a very long time, competitive players wished valve would support the competitive experiences their game is able to give, by bridging the gap between the public game to actual 6vs6 gamemode, so the gap between them is not a tiresome experience of registering in a 3rd party website and then waiting to finally get into a game, the gap should have been an official, working competitive gamemode in which players could get to learn how 6vs6 works, so they could be ready to climb to the higher levels of game.  Instead valve took the waiting times and equaly let everyone have them, for the same, terrible experience you get in public game.  The way valve treated their game like a joke, the difference in mentality between people wanting to waste their time dancing in this game and the people wanting to actually play the game, the fact the competitive community is not very welcoming to new players, the fact most of the personalities in the casual community should not even be personalities, is what keeps hurting this game the most. Even though, for reasons mostly unrelated to valve, this is the best game of all time , this had so much potential still. give me my badge"
"The best hat simulator to date - this game features a large assortment of headgear and other wearables in a variety of styles and colours. With the ability to trade, purchase and stash away pixels in a virtual backpack, you can finally feel comfortable knowing that you've wasted your life. And once you have completed your worthless collection of wearable items, you can show them off to other pathetic losers in-game. You can also express your poor creativity by naming, describing and painting your items with a large array of bland, depresssing colours. Become a true jew by repeatedly attempting to make miniscule profit off of hour-long trades! Oh, and you can also shoot stuff.  A must-buy for all basement dwellers and fat losers; 10/10."
"Used to be a really fun game, but one of the updates absolutely ruined it. I can't even join a server anymore, because it disconnects me and a screen pops up asking if I want to rejoin or abandon the server. I press rejoin but it disconnects me again. Yet it says abandoning the server will result in a signifigant matchmaking ban. So, yeah, can't even play it anymore. Yet it is a free game, so I suppose it might be worth trying at least."
"Very nice and addictive game. What I like about TF2 is that it is different from most FPS shooters, it's not your traditional military themed game, it's more cartoon-ish and not realistic and I absolutely love that fact. I recommend it to people that are looking for a FPS game that is not too realistically-military themed. The only thing I do not like however is that it's slowly turning into a dress up game and a hat simulator. Other than that, very addictive and good game."
Fantastic shooter that still holds up at nearly 10 years old. I wouldn't have my career or my passion for animation without this game and Source Filmmaker. It's safe to say I wouldn't be half the man I am without this game.
In my opinion the best free game on Steam. Lots of fun with no pay-to-win features.  9. july 2016: And now with competitive matchmaking!
"I have never considered giving this game anything but praise until now. Now I'm voting with my review to try and urge valve to bring back quickplay and casual pubs into the game. Not this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ overwatch/any-other-♥♥♥♥ing-shooter lobby based queueing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ how low the queue times are it still takes up to two minutes between games just for server connection. I used to only have to do that after literal hours of fun on whatever map I chose. Good players, bad players, tryhards, friendlies. All together. All having fun on whatever map they wanted. In whatever region they wanted, for as long as they wanted without any queueing or connecting. This change is utter insanity. Everyone was excited about matchmaking but I doubt a single person was hoping they would replace the ENTIRE game with it. For YEARS pubbing has been my favorite activity. The only thing in my life that guaranteed fun and an escape from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I pubbed when I was happy, sad, lonely or with friends laughing and having fun. This game is the most important activity is my life and has been since I started playing 5 years ago. Pubs have always been my place to just go and be free and have fun without a worry or care beyond that tryhard soldier I'm trying to stop from dominating me, or the free to play engie that crit me to death with his wrench. This game can be very competitive and I enjoy that aspect, but above all else it is fun. It has to stay fun. Please Valve. Please give us back the best part of this game."
"Oh man have I got alot to say about this game, but hell here we go.  I originally picked this game up in the Orange Box back in 08' just like 'im gunna be a pc gamer xdd'. Best purchase ever, probably the game that set the scene for all team based FPS's to come, yes that means you Overwatch (good game btw). When it comes to playing the game it almost puts you at ease with how easy it is to play but challenging to master, hell alot of fun. Even though the game has almost flopped several times, the community will always hold this game to its last breath.   This game is nearly 10 years old and has stood the test of time, sure ain't going away anytime soon. I highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a fun shooter that is  FREE .  oh and enjoy the hats if thats your kink"
waste of time
"    Please read the review before pressing buttons for having a thumbs down with red square, not every review means negative hate."
"was once a great, really great game.  code has become like your playing a pre-alpha. how many times has the endless sentry buster sound been 'fixed'? open console to see a sea of red. 'backblast etc' 'can't attach particle to null'.  item/trade servers are unreliable.  dead ringer killed PvP for me. i could deal with spys before this god forsaken thing came out. backburners that can airblast. the phlog...  valve doesn't listen or care about what  we the players  want.  i can't recommend this game. if you do play, for F&amp;%# sake don't spend any $$$ on it!"
Tf2 is an excellent class based fps that has taken over the last few years of my life.
"Team Fortress 2, where do I even begin. The trading? The gameplay? THE HATS?  THE CLASSES ---------------------------------------------------- There's the Scout, the Soldier, the Pyro, the Demoman, the Heavy, the Engineer, the Medic, the Sniper, and the Spy. They all have a variety of ways to either kill you easily, nearly kill you, or just annoy you to death.  The Scout is the fastest class, with his Scatterguns, Pistols, and his Bats, and he is also able to double-jump in the air. The Soldier wields a Rocket Launcher, a Shotgun, and a Shovel, and is the second-slowest class. The Pyro wields a Flamethrower, a Shotgun, and a Fire Axe, and is a mysterious person, whose gender is still unknown. The Demoman wields a Grenade Launcher, Stickybomb Launcher, and a Bottle, and is a man whose liver should have shriveled up and died years ago from his drinking. The Heavy wields a Minigun, a Shotgun, and since he is oh so manly, his bare Fists, and he is also the slowest class. The Engineer has a Shotgun, a Pistol, and a Wrench. He is able to build Sentry Guns, Dispensers, and Teleporters, to help attack the enemy team and support his team. The Medic wields a Syringe Gun, a Medigun, and a Bonesaw. He's a medical 'expert', and his Mediguns can heal the team and Ubercharge them, which can make them invulnerable for a short period of time. The Sniper wields a Sniper Rifle (no surprise there), an SMG (submachine gun), and a Kukri (a big knife thingy). He's Australian, he's got his sights on you, and you're his next target. Finally, we have The Spy. French. Elegant. Sneaky. A lady-killer metaphorically and a literal man-killer. He has his Revolver, his Knife, and his Sapper, which he can use to destroy the Engineer's buildings. His Knife can kill any enemy in the game with a Backstab (do I need to explain what a BACK-STAB is?), unless they are Ubercharged or if a Sniper is wearing the Razorback.  THE GAMEPLAY ---------------------------------------------------- Team Fortress 2 is often times a very fun, competitive game where you can snipe, stab, shoot, or stun, through different weapons and different classes (talked about above). There are often 'two groups' of TF2, the P2Ps (Pay to Plays) and F2Ps (Free to Plays). P2Ps are often known for having many cosmetics, valuable weapons, and skill, while F2Ps are often dismissed as terrible players who understand nothing and just happen to chase you around the map thinking you're a Spy. (My personal experience is that most F2Ps I meet are actually quite good players.) With many maps, many gamemodes, and many players, you're bound to have a good time. Why not try some cp_powerhouse, or maybe ctf_doublecross? And with the newest rumors of Competitive Matchmaking, we're bound to see some more fun.  -What is Competitive Matchmaking?- Competitive Matchmaking means that you're put in a server with other players as good as you, like in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. This is much requested by the Community as many players end up being the only good player in a server filled with terrible players, or players much much better than you.  UPDATES ---------------------------------------------------- Team Fortress 2 is often chock full of updates, commonly referred to as events, with some of the more recent ones as of November 15th, 2015, being the Invasion Update, Halloween 2015 Update and Gun Mettle update. There are also other major game updates from the past, especially the Uber Update, Love and War update and the Mann vs. Machine update. Many of these updates often have a Source Filmmaker (SFM) video to introduce these updates and their features, such as the Meet the Medic video for the Uber Update, the Expiration Date video for the Love and War update, and the leaked Invasion video for the Invasion Update. Some updates instead get a comic, such as the Gun Mettle update. Some of these events only last for a period of time and aren't permanent.  -What do these updates introduce?- Some of these updates, especially the Uber Update and Love and War update, add mass amounts of cosmetics, taunts, and weapons to the game. The Gun Mettle update, Invasion update and Halloween 2015 update instead have a special item (Gun Mettle Campaign Coin, Invasion Update Coin, and Sad Soul Gargoyle) that tracks kills and levels up at certain amounts of kills.  Thanks for reading my review :3"
It's finger lickin' good.
"Welcome to Team fortress 2, after 9 years in dev, we're still having a lot of ♥♥♥♥ happening in it.  TF2, best game I've ever played in my life. It's so much fun, the community is amazing, hats are everything.   What makes it so good? Hoovies, spycrabs, taunts, hats, Gaben, crates, community. Just, everything about this game is perfect, except the bugs that are still in the game for some reason.  Gameplay: I have no complains about it, the game runs really smoothly for me and the only time it lags is when I have a bad ping on the server. There are 9 classes in the game (&lt;- No ♥♥♥♥, Sherlock) and every one is a huge amount of fun, depends where you play and how you play. Everyone probably has their main classes because they are good with it, and enjoy it a lot. And the fact that you can have so many weapon selections is awesome. The best games I've had is when both teams are active and trying to win. I once got into a 1.5 hour game where we were just trying to capture the points.  Graphics: Well, it depends on what PC you have and how can it run the game. Some people need to run the game on the lowest quality which is not too bad, you just need to get used to it and everything should be fine. I don't think graphics matter too much, I love the game because of the gameplay, not because of how it looks.  Community: Best community ever. Everyone is nice and supportive. Everyone is so friendly (Unless they decide to rage) I bet some of who is reading got into a server where both teams are taunting to eachother and does random things to make the game better. People are really creative here as well, they make taunts, hats, weapons, maps. Just everything that could possibly make the game better.  Problems: Well, the bugs and glitches can be a problem sometimes but it's TF2...You would always expect a bug. There is no such thing as TF2 with no game breaking glitch. (&lt;- which is fine of course) Maybe the TF2 shop...Some stuff are stupidly expensive which some people find annoying. (Like me, 1-2$ for the machina? (I think) Come on, i can get that for free by going afk...)  One thing that I can't understand is that if you're an F2P (free to play.(Hasn't payed for anything in the game)), it might be a bit hard to fit in with the others and some people might laugh at you as well because you might be a bad player. Or because you're wearing the Gibus (But come on guys, gibus is the best hat in the game). Hats do not give you skill.  A mistake that I've done and you shouldn't...I spent a 'bit' of money on the game...It was worthless. If you want some cool items just try trading, yes, it's the long way, but it's better than wasting money just like that.  Everything in this game: Pootis/10, I love it!"
This game made me a 420 Nesquikscoper. 10/10
Let me rename this game a bit - Hat Collecting Simulator .
"Bought 8 unusuals, and 2 Australiums, 10/10 Could of donated to Charity"
"The game was ♥♥♥♥ing amazing for the longest time. Had the game since the orange box days. The game continued being good into the f2p days. You used to see your friend jump into tf2 and join their game, no problem. It was the only game I still enjoyed where you could jump into a server, like the old hl2 and counter strike days.   Then they put match making in to make the game more like overwatch. If you like that, great. But if I wanted to play overwatch, I'd play ♥♥♥♥ing overwatch. Not this bs where you have to have a premade group to play with your friends. I don't have a problem with games adding a matchmaking feature on top of their game, that's fine. More features to appease more audience. But they took out what made tf2 great to me; the casual, jump in and play whenever you want aspect that I have come to expect with valve games. Bring back the old valve server paradigm."

"Greetings ladies and gentlemans. I will write a small review about this game.   1: This community is really horrible I have no words for it.  2: If you are new to the game. Do yourself a favor and don't play on valve servers. Let me explain why: People are blind if you headshot an airborne solly, demo or even a scout people say this: You are a ******* hacker. If you headshot a scout with full build baby face blaster people are like: Nice aimbot dude hope you enjoy your kick/ban.  3: There is way to many horrible bad players.  That's all for now.  Have a good day."
"One of the best firstperson shooters out there, plus its free. If you got spare time, or just bored whilst doing work, grab your computer and play this game, cus we're all wait'n on ya!!!"
"Developed by: Valve Corporation Published by: Valve Corporation Release date: October 10, 2007   + Pros:  ▲ Visuals ▲ Gameplay ▲ Classes ▲ Free 2 Play  - Cons:  ▼ Hackers, Cheaters and Annoying Kids  9 / 10 - Extremely fun and addicting game. A great sequel to the awesome oldie Team Fortress: Classic."
"I really loved this gam but recently, because of the new meet your match update, It takes forever for matchmaking for casual and competative. I really wanna the play the older version where we could just choose what servers we want o play on. Please Valve, Change it back!!!! (;.;)"
"I used to love this game. No really, i did.  The servers where unbalanced, and most games where desided by one person who excelled at the game, but it was fun to win and pubs where common and easy to connect to.  And then I discovered community servers.  The community is the most toxic gaming community I have ever seen on steam. You speak against someone with a offensive name? You get ♥♥♥♥ on. You speak up for yourself? You get ♥♥♥♥ on. You speak up for someone else? You get ♥♥♥♥ on. You troll some ignorant ♥♥♥♥ who refuses to learn? You get ♥♥♥♥ on.  After that, I fell out of tf2, not even thinking about it.  But, then the new update came.  So I booted it up one more time, thinking the servers would be balanced, and the game would be more fair.  but they ruined it.   They promised a rework of autobalance that had players trying to join a game connect to replace a player who left. but THAT doesnt happen.  They promised a rework of the server system so players of a single skill level could play against others of that skill level, but THAT doesnt happen.   The community AND the game are both trash.   GG valve, GG."
"I liked the game a huge ton, I played it before when my old account didn't get lost, but ever since they decided to add competitive, I'm starting to think that's a huge knee to the balls, with nearly all guns players used/mained they nerfed it I'm not saying I'm not gonna play this anymore, just giving my thought out"
Ruined my life 10/10
"this game have all very funny and tactical too if you want , i been playing like 6 months and every time is like first time. very recomended if u wanna have a good time"
"Im not great at writing reviews but here goes nothing. Team Fotress 2. Where do i begin. I won't go too deep into detail but this game can be a ton of fun. It has litterally 100's of ways to customize your classes and loadouts with the ability to name and describe them to boot. Another great thing is that this game is also free 2 play so you don't have to shell out money if your just looking for a fun online FPS game.  If i had any crap i could say about this game is that it has poor performence even though i do own a computer MORE than capable of playing this game at a nice stable frame rate of 60. Every update seems to kill the performence more and more lowering FPS for everyone. For those who have lower end computers with decent parts but nothing spectacular,approch this one with caution."
"A very good, and addictive game, even years after its original release. The replay value of this game is just amazing, with each class can be played in different ways, depending on the situation and items you have. Also, this is one of the perfect example of a how free-to-play games should be, free users can get every weapons in-game , while upgrading to premium can be done as cheap as $0.10, completely optional, and gives tons of benefits and features. 10/10"
The new update.... Nt good
GREAT GAME (but it's mostly hats)
"This game is simply amazing, I don't care what you call of ♥♥♥♥ Haters say, Because does it look like anyone cares? If you don't like this game, Go back to Xbox Live Where you belong."
Literally the worst game ever
this game ♥♥♥♥♥ my wallet i now live on the street      420/10 VALVAO PLZZ MOR HETS
"Game of the year, every year."
"I'm broke, I spent all of my money on non-existent hats to wear while being ruthlessly spawn-camped by snipers. My team is always full of Gibus-wearing pyrovision Scouts. I have 5 MvM vouchers, yet no Tour of Duty badges because my team always goes full Sniper. And Spy. And one Pyro. I can't enjoy the sounds of my character's pained screams because of the squeakers constantly violating my ears. I've gotten into arguments with 9 year-olds about who has a better beard, which doesn't exist.  This is my favorite game of all time. 11/10"
"Team Fortress 2 is a free FPS but it has a lot diffrent game types from Payload, Mann vs. Machine Capture the Flag and more, You will have a lot fun in TF2 :D"
"As someone who played hundreds of hours, this game has become unplayable after the latest update. How am I to play a match where it is 10 vs 5 for multiple rounds? No autoblanace, no team switching, no voting at all.   Fix your game valve, you've already lost me, maybe you can keep other people."
"This game is 7.9 GB's, and 7.8 are hats."
"this game made me spent money on pixels and even on plushies, I've spent so much on this one game...   10/10 worth it."
Tf2 got penetrated in the ♥♥♥.
"It's reel ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review hours. I can't believe I had that much fun with this game. I'll miss the old days with the only focus being fun. Now all I see when I play is thousands of dollars or euros or what have you being spent on cosmetics. COSMETICS. You're only a true soldier once you've spent $400 on mvm tours to get a $50 aussie. Valve had their fun with us, taking our hard earned cash (or your mum's cash because you're 11 and don't have a job, or life for that matter) and giving us guns that count kills. HOLY ♥♥♥♥! I have a hat worth $1, right? And if I spend my paycheck on virtual keys, I may get a hat that, get this, COUNTS SCORE!!!!!!!!! JESUS H. CHRIST IT'S AMAZING. But don't get your milkshake in a knot, it gets even better. You have a 1% chance, if you spend ♥♥♥ loads of money of course, make sure you save enough money to pay your fokkin bills and buy food. But if you get lucky, you'll get a hat, that is on fire. REVELOTIONARY! ORIGINAL! WORTH MORE THAN THE EFFORT VALVE PUT INTO THE WHOLE GAME! This game was cute, loved calling it a hat simulator. Now it feels like, who spends the most money on hats that glow, and guns that count kills. JESUS ♥♥♥♥ING CHRIST I CANNOT EXPLAIN ALL THE ♥♥♥♥ VALVE PULLED ON US MY BOI'S. You know how much effort it took to make a gun count up by 1 everytime you kill someone? It took minimal effort. And yet, I see people rambling on about stranges, not realizing that they are talking about virtual guns with an orange outline that count up by 1. I'm not even touching the other ♥♥♥♥ like haunted, and battle-scarred through factory new. What a ♥♥♥♥in load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. But in the end, Valve gets the last laugh. Koods to Valve for absorbing our cash and giving us guns that count up by 1, and hats that have clouds floating above them. Valve won't even make a good update. Y'know? I wouldn't mind if tf2 made all items money value obselete, and just made items earnable,or every item obtainable without spending, not paying to look cool. ♥♥♥♥, this rant went on too long. Valve, still, excellent work exploiting human stupidity for profits. Now please cut the ♥♥♥♥, get off your lazy arses, and make GOOD updates for cs:go and tf2!"
"I got 1260 hours put into this game,  I played this game for years... and now... This 'Meet your Match' update ruined it. It takes ages to find a game, before the update i found a game in 9 sec. It's all competetiv now, and this: quick hop in and play, is gone now. It feels very toxic and all the fun is simply gone. Good job valve. You made another counter strike game out of our loved hat simulator  Won't recommend this game until they do something about it."
"First look at all the negative comments for this game, there all by 1000+ hour players, that hve loved the respected the game for years.   TF2 USED to be fun...... the newest update completly ♥♥♥♥ed it, there now pretty much two ''comp' modes. 'comp' 6v6 and 'casual' 12v12 and no PUB servers (WTF valve). I played tf2 coz it wasnt CS:GO; where players resort to hacks and bad attitides to get good at the game, I played tf2 coz of the funny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ moments that make you think 'da faq?' yet still make you laugh. how it's WTF HOW DID THAT HACKER SNIPER KILL ME, ♥♥♥♥ING DUMB TEAM!.  Vavle you sucessfully managed to ♥♥♥♥ up what made tf2 great, you standardized it. the Game is old so DONT compete with new games!"
"TF2 has been out for over 6 years and it still hasn't gotten old. You know why? Because Valve will never keep it the same thanks to frequent game changing updates. If you like shooting people, you'll like it. If you like blowing people up, you'll like it. If you like hats, YOU WILL LOVE IT. Just get this game. There's no reason not to."
"THE GOOD Team Fortress 2 is not your ordinary game. Focusing on its cartoony graphics, offbeat humor and wide variety of game modes and player classes, but it will definitely put some people off. If you're a person who likes team-based multiplayer first-person-shooter video games, I think this game is for you. The sound in the game is exciting overall together with the visuals. It's a perfect game. You are always updated with new incredible releases. Last but not very least, a very fun and unique shooter with cool mechanics and great teamplay is totally free to play.  THE GREAT The game can be addictive and challenging if you let it. The game is very fun, with different characters and balanced. One of the best Games of all time for sure. People who call this game or boring don't know much about shooters to be honest. Each class is a really funny, cool and interesting character with an unique and awesome personality. You're not running around with an AK47 or M16, but with Syringe Guns and Sticky Bombs, it's quite hilarious. Not to mention its great item-drop system, an amazing fanbase and the community, they are the perks which keep the players from all over the world to play this game.  THE UGLY There is no serious gameplay whatsoever. If the developers wanted players to have a real serious gameplay, they would have made an in-game system where players get penalized for quitting the game before the match ends. Face the facts: You can disconnect the current game any time you like even in MVM matches. Perhaps for dynamic joining and disconnecting of players of the current match, but it can be frustrating when you spend the whole damn match without stable players.  Gameplay Most Team Fortress 2 game modes have 2 opposing teams, the Reliable Excavation &amp; Demolition (RED) and the Builders League United (BLU), that compete against each other in various maps to complete certain objectives. Some game modes include: Capture the Flag: Each team attempts to steal the opposing team’s intelligence briefcase from their headquarters and secure it back at their own base. King of the Hill: A central point must be captured and defended for a set amount of time to win the round. Payload: One team attempts to escort a rail cart filled with explosives to the enemies base. Team Deathmatch: A team is able to win a round by killing off the members of the opposing team. Characters The players on each team must choose a class to play, each with their own set of abilities and special weapons. Medic: Heals fellow teammates with a Medigun that can ÜberCharged to make other players temporarily invincible. Scout: Runs very fast and is able to double jump. The Scout default weapons are a shotgun and baseball bat. Heavy Weapons Guy: Also known as just “Heavy”, this is the largest and slowest moving of the classes. He wields a minigun and boxing gloves, and can recover health by eating sandwiches. Pyro: Wears a gas mask and fireproof suit while wielding a flamethrower and fire axe and is best at killing enemies up close. Engineer: Can build teleporters, sentry guns and dispensers that aid other teammates in battle. Sniper: Can kill enemies from far away with his sniper rifle. Enemies can be killed with one shot if they are hit in the head. Demoman: Wields a grenade launcher and sticky bomb launcher that can be used to kill enemies around corners, or lay traps for enemies to run into. Soldier: A rocket launcher equipped brute that is capable of reaching great height by jumping while firing a rocket at the ground. Spy: Can disguise themselves as members of the other team, and can kill enemies with one hit if they manage to sneak behind them and stab them in the back. Can “sap” Engineer’s buildings to quickly destroy them."

Wasted thousands of my hours here. totally worth it. 10/10
"A wonderfully crafted cartoony arena shooter. If you don't already own this game, you are not a PC gamer.   There are 9 classes to choose from:  1: The Scout - A Boston-born, rude, in-your-face, and speedy character that has a double jump ability. 2: The Soldier - A crazed patriot from America's heartland. He's versatile and a great starter class to get familiar with TF2. 3: The Pyro - A mumbling pyromaniac of indeterminate origin who has a burning passion for all things fire related. 4: The Demoman - A scrumpy-swilling explosives expert from the Scottish Highlands. 5: The Heavy - Hailing from the USSR, he is the largest and possibly most dangerous class in TF2. 6: The Engineer - Specializes in constructing and maintaining buildings that provide support. 7: The Medic - Provides healing for the members of his team and has a special ability known as an 'Ubercharge'. 8: The Sniper - From the Aussie Outback, this character provides long-range support with his trusted sniper rifle. 9: The Spy - This character can be rendered invisible and can disguise as members of the other team.  There are also a plethora of maps, and weapons that can also be used to your advantage to gain control and defeat the other team. TF2 is definitely one of the best free-to-play games to ever be released."
this game is alright
"Team Fortress 2, one of the most enjoyable FPS, it's a unique kind of FPS, always getting updates, making the gameplay being more fun and exciting.  You can choose between 9 classes, all of them with their unique functions and abilities, you can always attack or defend, both are great in gameplay, you can attack and defend in thousands of ways, always surprising your opponents! You don't have money to buy weapons? No worries! You get them as long as you play the game, and even doing achivements. Recieved an weapon you didn't liked? You can trade this weapon to get another one in public servers or even your friends, or maybe use it to craft a brand new weapon. Yes, that's right! If you never played it, Team Fortress allow you to combine weapons to create new ones, a big variety of weapons, there's going to be one that you will enjoy using it. So, if you're looking for a different and new FPS experience, i recommend Team Fortress 2, i'm sure you will have no regrets.  "
Best game no-money can buy
"Probably one of the best, if not THE best online first person shooter out there. A game for casual players. A game for pros. Frankly - for absolute everyone. Pretty good mechanics, hilarous background story, frequent updates and events. 'Free 2 play' but not 'Pay 2 win'.  Nuff said. You absolutely have NO EXCUSE for not even trying it :). Both thumbs up."
That was a tasty banana!
"Download this game, it's a fun game. Alot of glitch/exploit/hacks but fun.   Edit: Hope some funny glitches won't get patch but even it is patched in the near future, it's still a fun game to play."
"Um, I don't even know where to start with you. Do you even know what we're talking bout? Do-do you have any idea... any idea what it is? Basically, kind of a big dea. You listening? Okay. Grass grows, birds fly, sun shines, and brother, Gaben hurts people. He's a force a' nature. If you were from where Gabe was from, you'd be ♥♥♥♥in' fat. WOOOOO!  Team Fortress 2, originally derived from years of development along with orange box, from a modification to quake multiplayer (now known as Team Fortress Classic) is a whacky, fast-paced, intelligently balanced, and high-learning-curve first person shooter multiplayer game.  It features 9 unique and complex 'classes' from which to choose, each with specific talents for various situations depending on map, gameplay position, and class selections on the other team. There is scout, soldier, pyro, demoman, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper, and spy. If you learn how to play every one of these and learn what weapons and loadouts are, you will be only marginally good at the game.  To be good at this game requires something called TEAMWORK. It's a frustrating, addictive, cartoonishly funny, skillful masterpiece, which is constantly in development by its lazy developers who leave bugs all around. This game is free to play, but I would recommend paying a small amount for a cool taunt or hat, and you're on your way to becoming the mediocre slime everybody knows and loves, setting things on fire, headshotting, gibbing people, healing patients from afar, and blasting hoardes of enemies with stationary turrets. This game is your own, and there's no right or wrong way to play it. But there are MANY wrong ways if you want to win. None of the right ways don't involve teamwork and using your head. Have fun. Random critical hits are fair and balanced."
"So, Team Fortress 2 is an amazing game, it comes with hardships, happiness, joy and everything else. But lately I've been feeling unsatisfied with how Team Fortress 2 felt like a chore too me, yes it maybe because I have 5202 hours or 217 days on Team Fortress 2. But mainly it's because, it's lost it's touch for me. I've played competive Team Fortress 2 for about 3-2 years, I enjoyed the fact that there was a competitive Team Fortress 2, with all 9 classes which is named Highlander, and 6v6 or 6s for short. I always quite fond of that, I recommend any Team Fortress 2 player who has over 100 hours to try it out, and if they like it get devoted to the game, because one day, maybe you'll be in ESports. I was quite hyped for the competitive mode they were going too add to this game, and still am but honestly I'm not going to install the game, to play it once or twice and be bored of this game again and uninstall. But I'll always remember this game, I'll always recommend this game to someone who is looking for a 1st person shotter, that has the quality of Wind Waker, but the stupidity of a comic. Still and will always be my favourite shooter in the whole wide world. GG boys.   10/10 best hat sim 2084"
Iz gud - Heavy Weapons Guy
TF2 is a terrific game. And it is free. Wait what it is free and great and you haven't played it yet? Go download it already!
"If you like playing 12v2, this game is now for you!  So sad that after years of gameplay, it's come to this. With the latest update came a lot of change to become a botched clone of Overwatch. And with these changes, the fun is gone."
"Overall, Team Fortress 2 is by far my most favorite game for the fact that, its really fun and there's a lot to accomplish in the game. There's 9 classes to chose from (I can probably main Soldier) and the trading part has me hooked as well. I recommend the game to anyone who likes a variety of modes, classes, weapons, and everything else Team Fortress 2 has to offer. You don't really have to strive to be the best. Just have fun playing. Thats what video games are meant for aren't they?"
I don't know why I buy other games.
"10/10 Best hat simulator out on there, and its even free.  Played 500 hours since december.   Prepare to get addicted...."
And then a pyro appears and...
This Game Rocks! :)
HATS HATS SCREAMING BABIES PEOPLE DYING HOTHOT FLAMEES PUT ALL OF IT IN A CAN AND MIX THROUGHLY YOU HAVE MADE A TF2!
"The best F2P that exist, endless hours of fun. Why are you reading this? Download it!"
Its like my grandma but with more hats and kids running around screaming
"Team Fortress 2 is really fun multyplayer game. There are 9 classes and all of them have balance, like heavy has a lot of health but he is really slow and really big target on the battlefield, sniper is verry good at long range but he is verry weak in close range, pyro is verry good at close range but weak at long range, ect. In tf2 there are weapons that you can get by random drop, buy them from mann co. store, craft them or trade them. All weapons have balance, no weapons are OP,if there is a op weapon it's going to get a nerf, they have good sides and bad sides, like frontier justice: you gain revenge crits but you have no random critical hits and smaller clip size, tomislav (minigun) has faster spin up time but has slower fireing speed. In tf2 there is so mutch teamwork, one team is probably going to lose if they have only one class on a team or if they don't have a medic or if they have 6 snipers and no engineers to defend. Overall this game is great and it's free, so if you are reading this on computer that you own, why don't you download the game. BTW sorry for my English ;)"
"Hats and guns. If the guns could wear hats, this would be the perfect game."
TF2 summed up  4:45 PM - Tilt: i really didnt think 4:45 PM - Tilt: i could meet ppl more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ than the ones ive met on cs 4:45 PM - Tilt: tf2 4:45 PM - Tilt: proves me wrong 4:45 PM - Tilt: everytime
"What can I say? Team Fortress 2... so many know it, so many love it.   This is one of those games that changed my outlook in many ways. As a follow-up to a game, to a mod, it's a wonderful experience that truly revolutionized gaming. From challenging play, to quirky characters, a great artstyle, and a unique universe and level design, TF2 has become a classic (in my mind) that will forever remain one of my favorite games.  If it wasn't for TF2, hats would never have been as popular as they are today. Hats4Life."
"9 Classes with fun personalities and gameplay, a really fun skill and team based (8 snipers on a team :P) game with a huge variety of really good designed maps. A lot of balanced weapons you can mix and have fun with.  Funny cartoon based models  'I need theres tf2 to live in happy'  My rating is: 10/5 genuine hats "
it has taken over my lief :(
"in great debt, have whipped many 10 year olds dressed as a reindeer with a rocket launcher, lost my son, wife and job to this game. 10/10 great for the whole family"
"I loved this game.  I've countless memories of late nights with TF2, it was a game I always went back too and a game I always enjoyed. Since I got older, I'd play less new games, after all I didn't have the time to learn and play them and why bother when I had good old TF2 if I wanted to chill out and play a video game?  Those days are over - the TF2 I knew and loved is dead.   Maybe I'll come back in a few months and they will have reversed these changes; on the other hand maybe it's a sign to move on from from TF2, and L4D and Valve (because who hasn't given up on HL3?) and look for something new.  Goodbye TF2, I'll always remember you fondly for what you were, not what you became.  RIP my old friend :("
I like playing this game while listening to mozart and having a glass of shardonnay.    And boy are my arms tired

"Let me start by saying I used to frequent this location often. The service is normally great and on any other day of the week I could expect to enjoy myself and feel happy about leaving a sizable tip.  However, since the new change in management, the once delightful and competent staff has disappeared. I can only suspect this is because the new owners are as unbearable as the people they hired to replace the old staff.  To say the new waiters and 'chefs' are unbearable is an understatement. The new managers must have hired their own kids and the brainless friends of their children. When my family and I went in this evening for dinner, no one moved to greet or seat us until about 15 minutes after we arrived. I spotted the hostess chatting away with some man at the bar. I eventually cleared my throat and asked 'Is it seat yourself, today?' Then this horrid expression developed across her face as she turned around and said 'Actually no, it's not.' She proceeded to talk for another minute before waltzing over to us. After scratching her ♥♥♥ in front of me, my wife, and our three children, she picked up only two menus and brought us to one of the dirtiest tables in the house. Looking at the menu, I could see her greasy handprint remaining.  Twenty minutes later, a waitress approached us, did not say a word, started writing on her pad, and then just walked away. She came back 5 minutes later with five glasses of water, none of which had ice. She blankly threw down almost every straw she had and then walked away again.  Five minutes after that, another waitress came out. This time, she actually greeted with a cheerful smile and asked us how we were doing this evening. When we inquired about the hostess and the first waitress, she apologized profusely and said that they are in the middle of training a lot of new staff. She assured us next time we come back we can expect better service. She got us more menus, wiped down the table, and got us a pitcher of ice water for the table. Things finally seemed to start turning around.  After we placed our order, we sat and noticed the renovations they made to the restaurant. The carpets were new, there was music playing, and the tables, when clean, were quite comfortable. For a moment, we thought were in the clear.  Just as quickly as our opinion of the change started to improve, it was ruined again. We heard shouting from the kitchen area among the staff. Several people (who sounded quite young) were shouting 'Do it, do it!' Immediately I was alarmed. There were not many people seated at the restaurant. I could only assume they were doing something horrible to our food.  Our food came out as soon as the shouting stopped. The first and second waitress and the hostess came out to deliver our food, all of them hiding a grin.  My wife looked alarmed. My children were oblivious. I said 'Thank you,' but they didn't walk away. My wife was about to bite into her tuna salad sandwich, but I stopped her. I picked up it and opened it. The three standing beside our table started looking nervous.  'Something wrong, sir?' The second waitress asked.  'I suppose we're going to find out,' I responded. I opened my mouth and took a bite of the sandwich. Most languages don't have the words to concisely describe the taste, but it tasted like rot with an overwhelming amount of salt.  I spat up the food immediately. I stood up, pushed the three aside, grabbed my family and left. The manager heard the commotion and made his way to us. I can't believe myself, but I simply gave him the middle finger, right in front of my children, and proceeded out of the restaurant.   In the car ride home, I kept wincing at the aftertaste. It was strangely familiar; it was driving me crazy trying to think of what they might have put in it. I considered going to the emergency room in case it was a poison of some sort. I didn't go to see a doctor and felt fine after a shower and something to eat from home. I longed for the old owner and staff. I detested the vindictive people who were currently at that restaurant. I wish the best for those old waiters and waitresses who got out of there while they could. In the end, the whole thing just left a bad taste in my mouth, but not nearly as bad as the one left by Team Fortress 2."
"I used to love TF2, but I don't think I can recommend it in its current state. The community is awful, the focus of the game is completely lost, and it has become a fashion show for people and their collectables. It's hard to find people in random servers that just want to actually try and play the game anymore. There is almost always one guy that just wants you to stand still and look at his stupid hat or #RARE gun. Most Demomen now just want to run around with a sword and an axe and get kills instead of actually helping the team by destroying sentries like their class is supposed to do. It is no longer a shooter people play to win at a casual level, but more of a virtual hangout for weird kids. I just want it to go back to what it was in 2007."
"You know what they say, if it ain't Broke, don't Fix it.  Well the last few Major Updates have pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed Up TF2.  Good Job Valve."
"+Hats DLC +   Autistic    Friendly community +Pootis   11/10 RIP in ♥♥♥♥, Spookwagen sempai!"
This is not a game...is a drug
even if its a free game it will still rob you from all your money
"Meet Your Match killed this game, the end."
The recent update has officially killed TF2... its very dissapointing that Valve is so concerned with competing with other games that they had to go and completly change what we loved about TF2.
"you want a review? well even if you didn't I'm giving you one anyways.   TF2 is not like most FPS games, let alone one that is free to play. TF2 is the sequel to a game known as team fortress classic, a mod using the unreal tournament engine. blah blah blah historical stuff I prolly got wrong. ANYWAYS: TF2 is quite simply an amazing game, with 9 different classes, each with their own unique roles in a successful match. 1. scout: he runs fast, capping intel, capping control points, and pushing the bomb cart with the power of 2 people! warning, since he runs so fast and has a double jump, allowing for high evasiveness, hes also pretty squishy, having a measly 125 base health.   2. soldier: soldier is a powerhouse, holding 200 base health and a rocket launcher that deals splash damage to multiple enemies. his rocket jumping ability (though this takes a LOT of practice to fully master) can get him to the point even faster than a scout!   3. pyro: the most controversial class, having 175 base health, medium-paced walking speed, and a short-ranged based primary (the flamethrower), pyro can be seen as the weakest class. while most newbies would complain to him being an overpowered fire demon here to eat your babies, they really just don't know how easy it is to counter her. (ONE SECOND THOUGH: PYRO CAN AIRBLAST PROJECTILES AND EXTINGUISH BURNING TEAMMATES BY USING M2, OR MOUSE 2).  4. demoman: arguably the most powerful class in the game, demoman is here to bring diversity to the game. (y'know, because hes scottish). anyways, demoman, while having the same 175 health as pyro, has one distinct advantage: the stickybomb launcher. this bad boy does 60 damage per sticky, meaning that spamming it on a public game makes you a bad player that should go back to playing minecraft and the hundredth jumpscare game pewdiepie just played.   5. heavy: also considered one of the weakest in the game (especially without a medic latched onto him 24/7) heavy is the mascot for TF2. this bald, bear wrestling, russian giant shows none of his ruthlessness in the game, but rather the comics (which even then he realy kind of doesn't). heavy has 300 health! 'wow!' you must think, until you learn his disadvantages. he is the slowest and has the largest hitbox in the game, making him easy to pick off from afar.   6. medic: oh boy. medic is the second fastest class in the game, just after scout. he also has 150 base health.your CoD-washed mind might think 'hey wheres his souper smg ding?' well thats because TF2's medic is actually here for healing. sure, he has a syringe gun (which is basically a flamethrower without afterburn) but no sane medic would rush into a fight like that, as he'd die near instantly. (each class has their own way of dealing 100+ damage in one shot, though this is mostly up to crits/ actual skill). instead, medic uses his medigun, a long, black, healing device that can patch up your teammate's wounds in seconds! plus, when you have full 'ubercharge' you can either have increased healing, full invincibility, 100% chance of everything your teammate does being a critical hit, or a tiny uber that increases your resistance to a certain type of attack, and gives you health for the damage the person you're healing recieves.   7. engineer: engineer builds sentries, dispencers, and teleporters. sentries will guard an area, sitting in place waiting for some unsuspecting scout to run in and get blasted away by tons of bullets (and rockets when your sentry reaches max level). dispencers health and provide ammo for you and your teammates. teleporters are capable of sending your teammates from one side of the map to the other, however, all these buildings require a lot of care, as they are susceptable to many attacks, and will do no damage to stock ubers (the kind that grants full invincibility). and since you'll probably be taking care of your buildings and aimbot, engineer only has 125 health.  8. sniper: sniper, if played right, can outdamage demoman! even though sniper only has 125 health, he has the longest range out of every class, what with a sniper rifle and all. sniper is the one of the only classes that can kill a fully overhealed heavy in less than 3 seconds. the sniper rifle isn't like most sniper rifles in other games. having good aim is essential to playing sniper, as his main source of damage is getting headshots, otherwise he'll normally do only 50 damage.   9. spy: spy is a real sneaky rat. he can diguise as any class, sap buildings (turning them off and eventually destroying them unless the engineer hits and breaks the sapper), his main 'deal' is that he can 'backstab' enemies. backstabbing someone is always an instant kill, with only for a few exceptions.   TF2 is a great game, and I suggest you look into it."
The shizzle!
The bestest game ever i recommend everybody to try this game :)
Blizzard have really outdone themselves with this game
Just get Overwatch or CSGO they are more competitive and a lot less of a disappointment when a new Update Comes Out.
"Hat Simulator 2K14 is the premiere hat simulation program of the decade! Best of all its free! {Jokes on you if your a pay to play, scrub lord}"
This class based shooter might seem cartoony and corny at first but once you start playing its a hell of lot of fun. Also there's tons of cool weapons and cosmetics to dress up with and try out. I have always enjoyed playing this game.
"You can't go wrong with this title. Not only is it fun, but it is ridiculously varied. Valve has worked on this game with additions and fixes since its launch, so it has undergone a lot of changes, and it barely resembles what it was when it first launched.  If you get into it now, sadly you're probably going to have a hard time understanding what's going on under all that cluster♥♥♥♥ of weapons, hats and whatnot, but even though it became such a chaotic mess, Team Fortress 2 remains my favorite Team-based FPS of all time.  You have lots of options with every class thanks to the sheer number of weapons available to them. Each one is balanced and focused on a specific role, so you're bound to find one that fits your gameplay preferences like a glove.  Don't like being an useless sniper who stands way back, away from the action? Fine, get up close and go with a bow.  Your team needs a strong offense in order to fend off enemy attacks, and you're playing as a Medic? Switch from the normal Medigun which confers limited invincibility to a Kritzkrieg for guaranteed crits, no problem.  Are you so pro with your aim that you feel disgusted using the stock Rocket Launcher as a Soldier or Grenade Launcher as a Demoman? No problemo, use the Direct Hit or Loch'n'Load to show off your mad skillz and deal more damage as a result of your prowess.  Do you love being a soldier, but feel a glorious desire to help your team with temporary buffs? Okay, give up your shotgun and go with a Buff Banner, Concheror or Battalion's Backup so you can help everyone push with increased damage, increased speed or increased defense, depending on your equipment of choice.  There are a lot of options available to you. It's simply amazing what this game offers. Plus, since it became F2P, there is no reason not to try it. Get it now!"
"BEST GAME ON STEAM! First off, tf2 has many gamemodes, so they're lots of choices to choose from! It's origanality is amazing, saying that it has trading weapons, have killstreaks and kill counters, hats and miscs, It's endless! Plus, it is one of the most played games on steam, and has a huge amount of recomendations, so go ♥♥♥♥ing buy this game, and ask friends about why they enjoy it!!!"
Makes me want to take meth and shove a rocket in my ♥♥♥♥ 10/10
"its okay - don't think i'll play more than an hour or two though, sorry."
"Thanks for completely ruining the pub version of TF2!   All the skilled players are gone. No one knows how to play.   For every minute I spend actually playing, I spent 10 waiting to play..   The last straw was changing the xp given for the 2nd time..  Dont come back and apolgise that you weren't listening to us like last time...  What a bunch of horse manuer  Even for free this is a piece of garbage  p.s. well i can see that you can't even get full servers any more   you're down to your core market of shutins and chronic masterbaters   you need to restore tf2 to the way it was"
"Months without a substantial update, and we get the following:  Unnecessary weapon skins that are essentially the same thing as botkillers, almost every weapon they touched was ruined (R.I.P. Engineer 2007-2015), and some new maps - one of which that should have been added months ago.  What's this? They cancelled Halloween just because they're too ♥♥♥♥ing lazy to make a pre-existing map nighttime and slap sniper's animations onto yet another boss? Jesus tapdancing Christ. Hey look, it was another ♥♥♥♥ING PAYWALL!  EVEN. SMISSMAS. HAS. A PAYWALL.  TF2 is dead.  https://youtu.be/Tg5QVKe_a9s "
"Team fortress 2 is a great game. Do not listen to those who say it's dead, or those who say meet your match ruined it, they're just too blind to see what the removal of pubs in tf2 was, it was the developers handing the torch over to community servers for gameplay like how pubs used to be. To those saying 'community servers are awful' no they aren't. Not every community server is a modded pony minigame server. If you think that's all community servers are, you are not looking hard enough."

"My son, who suffers from mild autism, is now in his room crying after being called a '♥♥♥♥♥♥' by one of the people with a cartoon horse next to their name, then he was issued a ban for 420 seconds. I understand these to be the actions of private server moderators. Now, I allowed him to play this game because it is usually very family friendly and politically correct, we especially loved the animations last year, but this is crossing the line. I don't know"
why do people play this game?  :o)
"The Best reason to have a Steam account, and a huge reason I am leaving consoles in favor of building a PC."
it's alright
"Reasons to play TF2 instead of Overwatch:   Rewards skill, you don't get things for free   Death actually means something   Casual and competitive both have something for everyone, despite being very different   Game doesn't take itself so seriously that every foray into the lore ends with a cringe   Advanced movement means that respawning isn't a completely brainless walk all the way back to the fight   Less visual noise   Better performance   Reasons to play Overwatch instead of TF2:   Pressing q switches weapons instead of making you suddenly better at the game  "
Nice F2P game from Valve. A good way to spend time with friends who don't like to spend money.
"It took me 2000+ hours of my life, to realise that this is a waste of time. But I recommend you have as much fun with it as you can, before you grow the ♥♥♥♥ up."
 WELCOME TO THE NUMBER ONE 'WASTE YOUR MONEY ON VIRTUAL HATS' SIMULATOR EVER!
i want my 2600 hours back  i wish i had friends
Who would be stupid enough to spend 100 hours in this game?

"Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is the sequel to the game that put class-based, multiplayer team warfare on the map. TF2 delivers new gametypes, a signature art style powered by Valve’s next generation animation technology, persistent player statistics, and more. Unlike other 'class-based' games that offer a variety of combat classes only, Team Fortress 2 packs a wild variety of classes which provide a broad range of tactical abilities and personalities, and lend themselves to a variety of player skills. Play as the flame-throwing Pyro, the room clearing Heavy, or the Spy, a master of disguises. Other classes include: Scout, Sniper, Medic, Engineer, Demoman, or Soldier. TF2 features the most advanced graphics of any Source-based game released to date – and the most exciting class-based action ever created."
"This is without a doubt the most entertaining game I have ever found. I'm not one for long story quests, the very thought of grinding away while searching for loot to wear makes me want to scream out in despair. I just don't have the patience for those games. This game is different from those and other shooter games in that it has 9 classes to choose from, each one with major differences. My favorite happens to be the soldier. Each of the classes is very different from the last and you have three basic elements at play. Fire, Explosives and Bullets. I know that may sound boring but they vary the classes enough that it feels completely different playing as a demoman or soldier. Each has their tricks, despite both being explosive. I suppose it was also the fairness which I liked. You do not pay to win in this game. My unusual rocket launcher is no different from the newbies stock rocket launcher. It does the same thing. That is critical for making a fun and balanced environment. I'll probably never quit this game. Come join me!"
"Gaben and Valve, Wonderful job. Probably my favorite game, (next to Garry's Mod), is Team Fortress 2. In another review, I said I wasn't a bit FPS fan. TF@ is an exception. This game is fun, has great visuals, and some of the bestgameplay in an F2P FPS. Some people might disagree with me, and thats fine. But, if you are new to Steam, I highly reccomend downloading this. And, you don't need the best pc to play this game, because there are people out there who ahve created low res textures and effects to help. I definately reccomend playing this with a wired internet connectin though. Trust me, it helps. This game is awesome, and I highly reccomend it to everyone."

"Are you looking for a game which you'll play as a team and do you want to have fun with your friends? Then this is a game for you. For real this game is so fun and awesome to play, this game has taught me how to play as a team and that is why I'm giving thumbs up for this game. Negative: Trading community is horrible nowadays (my opinion) Key price's so high that no one as poor as I am can afford a single key trough trading (unless they'll go for long run). all tho you can buy keys from steam community market place and inside the game itself. You can also challenge your friends to duel which are hecka fun :3 and you also see that which one is better you or your friend and on which class. There are 9 different classes (Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Engineer, Heavy, Medic, Sniper and Spy.) every class has their strenghts and weakness. This game is so well balanced between every class that even I can't find any class 'op' most of the times people say that pyro is 'op' but no. Pyro is actually pretty easy class to defeat you just have to know how. I do recommend this game for those who really want to enjoy and have fun inside game with their friends. "
"Screw having a girlfriend, this game is all you need."
"This game is awesome! it has everything a first person shooter should have, while being completly different than any other game! very recommended to download! have fun!"
Love thus game so much bant
Must I say it? Greatest FPS of all time!
bad game. spent too much money. free to play. bad.
"Team Fortress 2. The most fun you can have online.  Well, it sure used to be that way. Used to be, you could join your friends with a single click, or hop into any server of your liking at the press of a button.  Then Valve decided that 'having fun' was no longer what Team Fortress 2 was about, and forced everyone into a competitive format complete with ranks and statistics. Sure, you *can* still use the market gardener to give a meddling medic the surprise of his life, but you'll be dragging down your score and you know it.   Since the Meet Your Match update, the fun has gone out of this game. Enough for me to stop playing. It was fun while it lasted I guess, and perhaps, maybe one day Valve will realize the enormity of their mistake. We can but hope."

"If I wanted to play CS:GO, I'd go play CS:GO.  -9/420 Update gave me AIDS."
This new update sucks. TF2 is dead now...
"The New UI is cool, yet everything else is donkey ♥♥♥♥. I'd much sooner eat an entire bag of Sugar-Free Gummy Bears and ♥♥♥♥ out a new-formed naval cavity than try to connect to a ♥♥♥♥in' casual server."
Team Fortress 2 is one of the best games you can have a lot of fun in this game with its gamemodes and Updates
It's a game where people compete for cosmetics. Recommended for girls who love to dress up virtually.
"I can see many players have voiced out what I want to say so I don't need to repeat the same thing here. I won't remove my thumbs down until the quickplay is back. I just want to have fun from getting into a game instantly, and not waiting from minutes to hours to find a game to waste my time."
"i used to love this game and now with it's newly recent update this game is a pile of ♥♥♥♥ now   I was told my a friend to try out this game 5 years ago and loved it ever since. This game will always have a special place in my heart on how the game always helped me out through the tough times in my life. I've always had fond memories in 2011-2015 of playing pubs and doing the most dumbest stuff thinkable with my friends, or kicking back and playing some vsh or dr and also, when the economy was stable, but ever since gun mettle this game has been going really downhill  while other reviews already have the big things that are wrong with this update and the game but heres my output:  This game is DEAD valve doesn't care anymore, all they want is your money and their players back, and it seems they try to every effort to compete with newer (and better) games like overwatch and csgo  This update was the nail in the coffin to the game for me and I have no desire to come back   Edit: this account isn't my main one (thats why I have 4 hours) just thought I'd post my negative review here instead"
R.I.P Team Fortress 2  2007-2016 New Update show us how legends dies
i dont like the game that much its ok
"TF2 has been ruined by this recent update, hopefully valve will bring back the old tf2 someday. TF2 was amazing already, newest update ruined it. I mean like seriously why do you need competitive for casual? Can't we have fun without the confusing update? The community wants the old tf2 back!"
"Team Fortress 2 is really the Best Action game i ever played on. im still playing it because like Left 4 dead 2 its fun,spending bored times and you can also play some awesome,cool,funny 9 characters each one with his own tricks and this game is also the Paradise of Hats/Weapons/Miscs/Genuine/Vintage/Strange/Unusuals everything you ever wanted is here.  My most favorite Characters are the Scout/Pyro/Soldier/Spy. Best game i ever played on Steam!!   Rating:10/10"
"I remember shortly after the Gun Mettle update dropped, I hopped into a game and said my opinions about the new update in chat. Of course, someone disagreed and a flamewar started. This person said over and over that Valve 'cared' about the community and wouldn't do anything to ruin the game. I wonder if that guy feels like a dumbass now, or is just another brainless zombie saying 'Valve will fix it'.   Don't play it. You missed your chance if you wanted to get involved in the game.   "
"A great fun casual game, until the new update came. I don't want to wait an hour to connect to a server, to be poorly matched with other players. Once a casual fun game, now way overly competitive and has ruined it's community."
"F2p=Fun2Play.  Really Good Multiplayer Game.Balance Classes and just a superb game to have fun.Each and every class has some unique skill attached to them and mastering every class is pretty tough.After so many hours of play,I have only mastered Spy and Medic.  Best Game Ever."
"This may very well be one of the best games I have ever played, this fun action mann packed multiplayer adventure is a blast from the second start up the menu! Using a cartoonish styling makes for colorful unique maps and matches. One of the best parts about this game (other than hats) may be the nine very unique quirky classes who fight over well...gravel. Even though it is a free to play game and you can certainly have fun staying free to play, 'F2P' I do recommend that you buy an item from the in game 'mann co store', only buy a single item and you will be upgraded to a premium account, you will find better items, be able to trade as well as many other features. There is so much more to tell about this game but I alone cannot say it all, you must play this game to trully understand it, if you need tips or help I can and will try my best! Have fun and remember.... if you find a gibus...just..just keep it off ok? 9.5/10"
Technically this game has everything. From a steady stream of new content &amp; events as well as community made content and all the loving care the valve TF2 team can give like a mother goose would care for it's younglings but the overabundance of children really took it's toll on this game throughout the years.   For me TF2 gradually stopped being a fun shooter in recent times and started to look more and more like a ballpit at the mac donalds and i always knew that at some point the fun was going to stop so i have decided that it's time for me to part ways from this game and focus on other goals. Don't let this influence your first impressions about this game though after all this time and the many hours i put into this game i can look back at TF2 in a very positive way and had some of the most memorable gaming moments during my time as a TF2 regular.  It's free to play so the good part is that it's easy to give it a try free of charge to see if TF2 is the game you are looking for. Just be patient with the game though it's easy to play but takes some time to master.  Anyway i hope to have helped you with my review. Whether you have found your new Nr1 game or have decided to keep looking a little furhter i am happy to have played a small part in it.  All the best! (s.i.e)
Ill admit. Ive stopped playing this game. But not because I didnt like it. If I didnt like it I wouldnt have 1000+ hours in it. I stopped playing because the economy was failing. For anyone looking to play a game with a good trading economy. I honestly cant recommend TF2 any longer. But if your looking for a kind community and endless fun. This is the game for you. Its cartoony- and classy. At the same damn time.
"One of the best and top rated games ever, free to play full version for everyone so want to try (',)  Teamwork. Collect and trade items. Many different versions of map and game options. Free to play, and easy to meet and make new friends worldwide through steam online with TF2.  Recommended game for the ones so have just started using steam, and have no idea what game to start with.

"Ruined my life, 10/10"
10/10
Great game and an fantastic game with friends.
"I have put almost 500 hours into this game. It used to be a quick fun FPS. The Meet your Match update ruined that. It takes too long to setup, it penalizes you for leaving mid game, it just isn't even close to what it was. I am no longer interested in this game. This has made me rethink the time I waste on gamming. I should be doing something else with my time, and not wasting it on this.  10/10, uninstall worked and I am getting my free time back."
"I play that game since August 9 2013. Never complained about updates or buff and nerf from any weapon. According to backpack.tf more than $350,00 in cash with cosmetics, australiums and taunts and you ask why? Well, because I like that game. Recently I bought Overwatch Origins editon (the expensive one). Its a great game, but the game didn't captivate me that much. It doesn't have the 'magic' Tf2 has. Play with friends, troll new players, Become movable dispensers (aka Hoovies with sandvish), meet G.E.W.P, Enter in whatever server you would like, get auto-balanced few times (but you know, at the end we all laught about those things). But with this new idea of how Public servers (pubs) work, the time we spend trying to find a server, without being able to change your team, they ruined the unique gameplay that Tf2 have to offer. Really? Real losers and winners? If I wanna play for real I'd go play on competitive. Not in a server to have FUN. I agree that on COMPETITIVE those news modifications are a good thing, But in a Pub?? Really??? Probably I'll come back to overwatch after this update, unfortunately. "

"Nine distinct classes provide a broad range of tactical abilities and personalities. Constantly updated with new game modes, maps, equipment and, most importantly, HATS-HATS-HATS!"
"Great game based off a great engine, you'll see lots of new things every week from the community and valve, the best free to play deal you can find, unlike the silly 'pay to win' games.  Whether you like sneaking behind your enemies or burning them down with fire, Team Fortress 2 is a great game!"
"Short Review: Go And ♥♥♥♥ing Download It    Long Review: Team Fortress 2 is definantly the best Free to Play game out there. There are so many different game types in TF2 from CTF,Mann vs Machine and even the Hidden. You can get any weapon by crafting,trading or finding, without using real money. Although you are limited to a short backpack space as you start off, you can easily purchase a 10c item to upgrade to premium and get heaps more spaces. Even though being released 7 years ago there is always an update around the corner.   One of the best things about TF2 is that if you get an item which is festive,vintage, strange,genuine, collectors and more you can sell it on the steam market and get real steam credit. I know I have got a a lot of moeny from selling my items, some people even get 500 of steam credit, by selling a rare/awesome item. I can`t possibly list all the things you can do in TF2, but overall Team Fortress 2 is the best game ever, it even beats all my paid games. :)"
"Removal of pub games ruined it, no longer fun."
"You had to screw this up Valve, hadn't you?"
"If you want to have some fun with your friends, this game will make you have great times."
It's a good game
this game gets me moist
"Team fortress 2  I would say after spending at least 1k hours on this game, it has an interesting and well desgined set up towards competeive team fights. As well as creating a goofy and entertaining enviorment that is customizable to a certain degree.  The game demands a heavy amount of teamwork towards objectives on maps. However at the same time, value has assesed the true interest of the game. Killing enemy players. This has been provided through arena modes, team competions, and a decent amount of maps that allow the player the simply enjoy themself within the enviroment given.   The game itself provides an exellent way of assisting new players, such as coaching which has an experienced player go out of their way in order to help new players. In doing so, experienced players are rewarded. However, this is what value has done in order to assist new players.  The community can be extremely harsh when it comes to new players. New players are easily identifed via not having any hats, having a hat that is easily accessaible via achievement, or simply inexperience. These players are looked down upon within the community due to their lack of understand towards certain events where players may be trying to do something outside of the common norm within the game and a new player disturbing it. It is also laid out that new players do not understand how to assist a team greatly, even sometimes ruining a game.  In my opinion, I believe that it would be benefical to most of the community that new players were to take some time to figure out classes, look up online tutorials towards how you should play your class, even take some time to face agianst hard bots.   An easy way to not be quickly looked down upon, targeted for pranks, is to simply buy a universal hat. This will give players the idea that you may not be 'free to play' so to speak. Though other than being targeted because of inexperience, the community can be quite...interesting. It all depends towarsd how you go about putting yourself out into the community.  Though this game provides a large variety of assests that protain towards the entiertainment needs of the vast majority of gamers through third party resources such as custom modders, map designers and much more.  In conclusion, I would find that this game is extremely fun, only if you can put together how you can do it well. Where exactly you may fit in with the community itself. If you find the right place to be, you can find yourself playing this game for a long time."
"It's a perfect game. You are always updated with new releases incredible. This game is very fun, with different characters and balanced.  Game : 9.0/10 Graphic : 9.0/10   100% Achievement :  Easy | Medium | Hard |  Very Hard "
"Awesome game,  (If you're bored of playing on a serv then just go trade, and if you're bored of trading then go back playing on servs ... ;D)  Also, there is 9 classes so 9 different ways of playing this game,  Just, an awesome game !  Did i say it was an awesome game?  "

"This game is great. If it can ruin my life, it can ruin yours too!"
sniper throw pee on enemys. 10/10
Easily worth the purchase price.
"The best recommendation I can give for this game is that I started playing it over 7 years ago, and still play it. Best advice I can give for playing it is find a welcoming server, preferably with good ping. That's all I have to say. Go, play and enjoy."
"Life traverse is exceptional for forceful shooters. Hardly a month goes by without new virtual fields springing up and appealing you into some fresh conflict, and only a few surely understood redirections make sense of how to oversee dynamic player bases even a year after their hidden release. What's more, a short time later there's Team Fortress 2. Released in 2007, this class-based commendable is so far going strong particularly into its seventh year, in view of its vigorous and innovative gathering. Since GameSpot's one of a kind TF2 review, the entertainment has benefitted from different upgrades and made the skip to a permitted to-play plan of activity.   The middle action pits two gatherings of players against each other in a battle to get centers, move a truck, or take an organizer case. The objective is always uncommonly clear; it's the exchange between the nine playable classes that makes things so varied and interesting. The convenient scout, the assailant generous, the tireless pro, the conspiring specialist, the irritating sharpshooter, the tricky see, the feisty pyro, the shaky trooper, and the fundamentally more-risky demoman all have exceptional weapons, attributes, and limits that supplement each other and strife in bundle ways. Encounters can vary comprehensively depending upon the match sort and the beautifiers of each gathering, and this strangeness is dire to TF2's long-standing solicitation.   When you leave the door as a mind-boggling with a specialist near to, you're a forcing unfriendly constrain, yet if a spy hovers around to deceive the specialist and you round the corner on a pyro, it can all come unwound in a matter of seconds. Master marksmen can cover expected foe ways, however rocket-ricocheting warriors have an ability for finding elective courses and raining dangerous going from above. You may think you have an also fragile scout dead to rights, just to be lurched by a baseball and beat the life out of. As you watch your giblets splatter on the ground and see a quit packaging of your cheerful killer, it's hard not to chuckle at the sheer grouping of ways you can meet an unfavorable end. Besides, engaging jokes, insane outfits, and sensational host build up this sprightly tone.   Clearly, this inside component has endured for by far most of TF2's future, so if you quit playing it two or three years earlier and return for a couple matches, you'll find things are to a great degree surely understood. Taking in the ropes and getting the hang of your picked part is still a delightful information, and acing pushed frameworks doesn't just make you deadlier; it gives you more options for how to approach fight. Keeping your choices open is still gainful too, in light of the way that being versatile with your choice of character can help you refrain from ending up on a disastrously imbalanced squad. It is Team Fortress, taking all things into account.   Regardless, however there is much that has stayed steady about the inside redirection, there have been some noticeable changes consistently, and moreover ordinary imbuements of new weapons and things. Of the few things available in the online store, some can be opened through play, while others must be acquired with genuine money. From little knickknacks that cost not precisely a dollar to huge packs that cost hundreds, there's a broad assortment of ways to deal with adjust your experience.   Some of the things offer just a vigorous twist on the entertainment's starting now saucy toon snappy. You can buy tops, shirts, shoes, and other remedial gear to spruce up like a character from Adult Swim or wear spooky incidental garments that you can wear just in the midst of Halloween or a full moon. Notwithstanding the likelihood that you don't support spending for any of this stuff, it's diverting to see some visual grouping as you endeavor to light your adversaries on fire.   The best difference from the redirection's beginnings comes in the accommodating mode, Mann versus Machine. In it, you and a few other human players must maintain a strategic distance from swarms of robotized incarnations of TF2's classes from passing on a bomb to your base. The money you pick up from pulverizing robots can be spent on mid-organize climbs to your qualities and weaponry, which can be essential to accomplishment. For sure, even on the most easy level, the robot armed forces are adequately wild to test the guts of a messy gathering. This is a mode where absolutely masterminded weapon choices and defensive frameworks can mean the differentiation among succeeding and attempting, endeavor afresh. You can play this mode to no end, yet you won't be met all requirements to increase exceptional prizes or complete difficulties unless you pay a dollar for a Tour of Duty ticket. Notwithstanding the way that it doesn't have the energized oddity of centered play, the supportive mode can even now offer satisfaction to those adequately committed to see it through.   However, contention is the honest to goodness draw, and the Team Fortress 2 gathering can completely be engaged. On a couple of servers, you might be scolded for unwitting cracks of respectability, while on others, you might be welcomed with pleasing tips and ubercharges. You can even demand help on particular servers and be corresponded with another player why ought to willing give you a couple tips through talk. The society around TF2 is a charming one, not just for their significant learning of and vitality for the delight, yet for their imaginative attempts in arranging new weapons, things, and maps that have since ended up being a bit of the experience. It feels like a gathering of managers, without whom the delight may well have dwindled away and gone into obsolete nature years earlier.   Staying imperative even a year after release is extraordinary for an engaged shooter, yet, here's Team Fortress 2, still overflowing after seven years in the business. Every so often it feels like comparable diversion you could have played back then, and at various times it feels like no one will ever extremely nail class-based shooter competition the way TF2 does. The experience has created during the time without exchanging off what made it so extraordinary regardless, so however your permitted to-play choices may have extended altogether in the past couple of years, there are few that do it furthermore Team Fortress 2.  (All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time. In my religion, this is known as Art(TM), but you can call it 'Threewording')"
"Aaaaaaannnnd... they have done it! Valve has ruined TF2! They have just added so many ♥♥♥♥♥♥ changes, it is totally unbelivable! A broken matchmaking system, and a quickplay that can ♥♥♥♥ off, i mean really, pentalising someone 4 leaving a casual game!? All this ♥♥♥♥ and for what?! Too compete with new FPS shooters like Overwatch! TF2 had (and still has) lots of tings Overwatch doesn't have, for example; TF2 is a F2P game, Overwatch is not. When I first got steam, teh first thing I did was going to teh Free 2 play part of the store 2 check for good, FREE, games. TF2 was thh first thing that met my eye. I downloaded it, tried it, and emidiatly loved it. It was the best game I had played in a long time! Even tho I was completly new to the game (and the fps genre in gennerall), i had fun. TF2 WAS a game that you could just jump into, play a few matches, have fun, and then leave. With the most recent update, you're (as mentioned earlier) ♥♥♥♥ing punished for leaving a ♥♥♥♥ing 'casual' game! WTF Valve!  I don't think Overwatch is going to be the end of TF2, I think Valve is perfectly capable of ♥♥♥♥ing up their own game!"
Helped me learn how to create virtual hats 10/10
"Best game i have ever played on Steam! I like every Easter Egg that this game have, and i like the competitve game system i learned a lot! Several kind and friendly players. I like everything in this game. Except the random bad things agains me... haha ^^ . . . 'Why should i live if i can play it?'"
Rocketjumping makes this game great 10/10.
It's a fantastic game that is likely to grab your attention and never let go.
"This game leaded me into this community, thanks to tf2 i could meet others friendly players, new partners... and took part in this community, try tf2 out guys!"
One of the best games i have played it is fun good graphics and the no.1 hat simulator
THIS IS SO BULL I started playing 2 days ago and i loved it i really did and i got my computer for several certain games and this was one of them and they made it really sad because i was really hoping that i could 1 day get a hat from a random drop but no that dosent exist anymore and the matchmaking is complete ♥♥♥♥ i havent been able to get into a single match and they made it like a moba if you leave you get penalized and that is COMPLETE BULL♥♥♥♥ SO YOU KNOW WHAT ♥♥♥♥ YOU VALVE YOU HAVE TAKEN A AMAZING GAME AND THREW IT AWAY OK BECAUSE I WOULD RATHER SPEND 100$ UPGRADEING MY COMPUTER SO I CAN PLAY OVERWATCH THAN PLAY THIS PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥ OK BECAUSE YOU NEED TO PULL YOUR HEADS OUT OF YOUR ASSES AND START COMPETEING WITH OVERWATCH OK AND YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL OK BUT ITS TO LATE THE DAMAGE IS DONE YOU JUST LOST SO MANY PEOLE WITHIN A HOUR OF THIS UPDATES RELEASE OK SO IF YOU FIX THESE THINGS I MIGHT PLAY AGAIN BUT YOU ARE SO FRUSTRATING YOU NEVER LISTEN TO ANYONE WHY IS THIS...... here is the thing you.....fuqed up and i dont think it will come back and whats sad is that i finally was getting good with spy and scout but you ruined it ok and i dont think i can forgive you guys for it this game was amazing and you managed to ruin it i... i am just really disapointed you need to think before you do ok and start listening to your fans or you are going to lose alot of them this game is filled with amazing people and you let alot of them down just please start listening and being more mindfull of the things your fans want honestly T-T
"This latest update has killed one of the best things about TF2. One of the main reasons TF2 was among my all time favourite games was the casual, relaxed and silly aspects of quickplay, something which I find so many other multiplayer games to be lacking. This is part of what gave TF2 it's soul. And this was completely ruined by the recent 'Meet Your Match' update.  Quickplay has been replaced with the 'Casual' gamemode, where you no longer have a choice over your desired map or gamemode and are now penalized for leaving the game. This was one of my main appeals of TF2, being able to jump in and out of a game whenever I wanted, but now this is gone. On top of this, the so-called 'Casual' mode is ranked.   People have been saying their que times have taken up to 30 minutes to find a game - I personally have not even been able to play a game before the new TF2 Game Coordinator crashes and disconnects. The only time I managed to join a 'Competitive' mode game, I was disconnected by the TF2 Game Coordinator before the game even started. It did not allow me to reconnect in time so I recieved a temporary ban for not being able to maintain a connectction to the TF2 Game Coordinator, even though my internet connection was fine on my end.  Until this new 'Casual' system is fixed or reverted back to the old Quickplay mode, I sadly can no longer recommend Team Fortess 2."
I can play as a bird man that heals people with a fire hose
this game is alright
"Good game, casual is not balanced, there is no auto balance, they disabled it, most games are one sided. one team dominating the other. check out community servers they are good."
"Team Fortress 2 vs. Overwatch   TL;DR  at the bottom  Disclaimer: I have not played Overwatch. The review is based solely one what I know from my friends and watching a ♥♥♥♥♥on of streams/youtube videos. What I say here should not be taken as fact. If you have a conflicting opinion on what I say here, feel free to state it in the comments below.  It should also be noted that I have over 3,000 hours in TF2 and can be trusted to make a relatively accurate assessment of the game.    For most, if not all TF2 players, the figurative elephant in the room that players are uncomfortable to address is Overwatch. I don't blame them. It's a fantastic game developed by Blizzard, a company known for it's MMOBAs and not first person shooters. However they've seemed to hit this ball out of the park with Overwatch. Most dedicated TF2 players (including myself) are a little salty if not tilted at the triple A title for taking the spotlight for class-based first person shooters. They are also upset due to big names playing more Overwatch or simply leaving TF2 altogether. Some examples may include FROYO Clockwork, Muselk, and Ster.   The problem lies with people immediately seeing it and comparing it to TF2. Yes, on the surface it is very easy to see the similarities is shares with TF2 and the developers have openly stated that they took inspiration from TF2.    BUT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO STRESS THAT THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT GAMES, I CANNOT EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH!      Overwatch relies more on teamwork and strategy and less on mechanical skill and movement that must be practiced over time. Most players note that they tend to master most classes after 100-300 hours of playing. It shines the most when players coordinate together, swapping heroes (classes) to counter the enemy, and predicting the enemies movement. It unsurprisingly plays more like one of Blizzard's MMOs than a first person shooter.   TF2 relies much more on practiced and mechanical skill although it does have a very strong reliance on teamwork and coordination. Skills like rocket jumping, trickstabbing, and reflecting projectiles all take a considerable amount of time to master and encourage players to be well versed in 1 or 2 classes. Thus, people tend to 'main' a specific class. For example,  one of  the most notable Soldier/Scout mains is FROYO B4nny is well known for being one of the best players in the game with over 15,000 hours. In Blizzard's Overwatch, people tend to main a hero less and main a hero-class like 'Tank' or 'Defense.'    TL;DR  TF2 and Overwatch, although seeming very similar, are different games that cater to different players. Both are still amazing games but comparing them is like comparing your favorite pizza to your friend's favorite soda. Obviously, there will be differences even though both are extremely enjoyable."
"Team Fortress 2 was one of the best games I had ever had the privilege to experience, a few years ago, of course. TF2 is no longer the unique, team-based game it used to be. It has been narrowed down to an unfair, unbalanced mess of 'who has the shiniest pink hats on trade_minecraft,' 'how fast can you get kicked from every valve server because some stupid kids think it's their private achievement server.' and 'how to get outskilled by someone using a more broken, overpowered weapon/class.' Team Fortress 2 also hosts one of the nastiest communities to date, right below Garry's Mod and DayZ. I guarentee you, every server you join, you will be greeted by several bronies and furries spamming lenny faces, stupid Shrek memes, and pootis. If you like getting penalized for simply playing the game, this is the one for you. If you're 10 and still think memes are funny, this is the one for you. If you like having an overall bad time, this is the one for you. Team Fortress 2 also suffers from a severe lack of content updates. Every few months that go by, they will add more cosmetics and taunts to ruin the game and community even further. They DO NOT add balanced maps or weapons. They DO NOT balance the current game mechanics such as pellet/damage spread and random crits. They DO NOT Penalize those who are literally unable to play the game at an acceptable level. For example, if you get a team full of idiots who installed Steam the previous day, they get to stay with their 300-700 ping, slimeball community avatars, and inability to speak English in English servers. They will also vote kick you. Usually selecting the 'No reason given' option, for they cannot speak English. Overall, if you are really looking forward to making your day a bad one, play the steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥ that is Team Fortress 2."
"Adding matchmaking did not only make it really difficult to play with friends, but also bulldozed so many communities.  We really didn't think you could do treat the game worse than you have been for the last couple of years.  Well done Valve."
"So what can i say about this game?  For one The current TF2 Team are complete idiots and i hope they eventually get cancer and die crying around their families.  That being said, whats wrong with TF2?  Well there's the recent updates  Meet Your Match = Got rid of pubs...ya know the best way tf2 was played?...they increased the hacker ratio and survived ability and any loser who likes this update just says 'just leave the match' but isnt rage quitting bad? so why should i quit cause some loser downloaded cheating scripts.. oh and this update also decreased peoples frame rates due to the unneeded cosmetic features on Casual and Compet.  Scream Fortress 2016 = ya know that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ yearly thing TF2 does that is only okay on pubs? lets make it on a competitive mind set game mode with no team switching and of course alot of hackers, the cosmetics in the creepy crates are boring except 2. the increase in unusuals is nice but it's still only 2 percent meaning More money wasted.  Oh and there's SV_Pure 1, originally designed to stop hacking. but instead makes Fun mods stop working. The Fem pyro Model, the Dance taunts music replacements. the only thing it HAS stopped was loud spy noise mods..but...you can easily stop using headphones and just turn up the volume. it's not hard.   i know that my expectations for Valve might be Too high. but im not lowering them for a company that only started a refund system too many years too late AND with the refunding process is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  I hate V-a-l-v-e and their stupid censorship when they allow Porno games like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Anime games i have seen the grumps and markipler played in the past  i hate you V-a-l-v-e and your idiotic business choices that hurt you more than help you. please grow some brains.."
"this is by far the best game i have ever played, but it need more hats :3"
"Game was awesome,but new update comes and game now suck"
10/10 This Game Will Destroy Your Social Life But It's Well Worth It
It's ok
"Make TF2 great again! Last update destroyed this game. Matchmaking takes 5 minutes to find a game, you can't choose a map, comp sucks. You get PENALTIES for leaving CASUAL games, what is this, overwatch? Rest in Peace, old friend, i loved you like a son. #riptf2"
"unbalanced, unoptimized, uncomfortable peace of sh!t  R.I.P. TF2 2007 - 2016"
Now I love this game I bet everyone who played it did but don't support valve with this game anymore they don't listen to the players and ruin the experience for everyone and have people pay more than cs:go to get into competitive. Don't buy it's garbage there is no calibration so you will end up any where and you could win and get all gold medals and still get deranked it's a dumb update and it's ruining tf2 they have only messed up on every update.   They can make a game of football (pass time) but not make a proper update.
"+Fast-paced, addicting gameplay &amp; game modes +Unique weapons +Rather fun crafting &amp; trading system +Great maps +Mostly friendly community +Awesome mod support (except for Valve servers) +Hilarious, distinct, fun to play as, 9 different classes +HATS!!  - too much kids !!! 7,4/10"
"*Tries crafting headgear* *Realizes it doesnt work* *Realizes ive wasted time* *Realizes ive wasted 2 pages of my weapons* *Dies* Other then that moment that almost ruined the game for me, Its a pretty addicting game. And its F2P (And not a forceful p2w)   I got back into the game now and it was just a glitch. still wasted like 3 refs though lol"
This is a really weird game.
  They talk about my random crits
Nice game!
Wonderful simulation of the hat trading black market
"This a very entertaining game that allows you to battle with friends, or just anyone, by choosing one of nine classes that each has their own pros and cons. You will either be on team blue or team red. Obviously, the teams are against eachother and you want to battle the opposing colour. There are a variety of game modes to choose from where you must beat the other team. You can trade items, and there is even a whole currency for this game that is used in trading, or when identifying the price of your specified item.   Overall I think this game is great. I highly recommend it for people who love action filled games, and who love to learn new skills. I recommend helping your team out if you would like to win, and don't leave them behind. Team Fortress 2 is a great game, but is better accomplished as a team rather than a singular person.   If you've never tried the game, I recommend you give it a shot, it's loaded with entertainment, and you might just like it."
Team Fortress 2...Most Epic FPS Online game i ever played. This game includes all classes that every FPS Games combined!  Everyone calling you an F2P in a server? No worries! Just dominate them with any Gibus Hat you own to hummiliate them!  10/10 would play this...even grandparents
"*Trembling* Uhh, yes, I think this game is amazing a-a-and could only be improved by adding more weap- UUHH I MEAN HATS. YES HATS. THE HATS ARE AMAZING. WE NEED MORE! *Sob* *You hear a gun cocking* 'READ IT ALL!' Please Valve, we need m-mm-more hats! If you don't - AAAAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHH I DON'T WANT TO BE KILLED BY A HAT!"
CooL GamE =)
"Team Fortress 2, seems like such an understatement when I say I recommend this. It's probably my favorite game of all time with over 2000 hours logged on it.  Even though people may not like the hats and new items, personally I think that's what keeps this game alive. Every time the game feels like it's getting boring or repetitive, they add something new that makes the game feel fresh and fun. This is the only game I think I'd ever give a perfect 10/10, because the game's always expanding. The community on the other hand, is quite a lot like the Sonic fanbase, and I'll just leave it at that.  In conclusion, if you haven't played this game before, DO IT; I cannot stress that enough, download it and play it. It's free, but I highly recommend buying something in it at some point in time."
Best game ever. Ruins your life &lt;3 Empty your walet. Show off hats. Have no social life. Die happily with your virtual hats. 10/10 no doubt
The Best Game I Ever Played!!!!!
Fun. That is all
If you havent played this game. your life is incomplete.
"Though my actual in-game hours is closer to 600 hours, Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is one of the best first-person shooters of all time. Feeling the need to just fool around? TF2 is hilariously comical. Feeling the need to play competitively? TF2 has a very high skill cap. Feel the need for variety? TF2 has mounds of variety.   Verdict: Team Fortress 2 is a game where just when you think you have had enough of it, it lures you back in and leaves you thinking, 'man, I totally love this game.'"
Amazing game with good people who came to have fun :)
"Well I was once like you, a person with a life scrolling through steam, until I saw this so called inncoent game. I donwloaded it,and begain to play now i can't stop and i refuse to leave my PC! I highly reccomend it!"
this game ♥♥♥♥ing killed itself. rip.
gg valve you ruined that ****ing fun
"Team Fortress 2 is a unique game in many respects, first and foremost being just how much (and for how long) it's been updated. While it's only recently gone Free, Valve has been supporting the title for years with rather significant content additions, and game-breaking bugs tend to get squashed within hours or days, rather then the months that some other companies take with even their flagship titles.  It's also interesting in the fact that you don't actually have to be a living god at first-person shooters to do well or support your team. The Engineer and Medic help their allies out with their buildings and healing abilities, and the hundreds of items available can change any of the classes' capabilities significantly. And, of course, the game is infamous for it's cosmetic items, such as the hats, which don't typically provide any real bonus but do allow you to customize your character further.  You have to play this game. And if you're on Steam, you already own it!"
"I bought this game (retail) and then spent a secret amount of my disability benefits and allowance on virtual hats and keys. Now I wear a fedora on most of my mercs and recently started a vintage fedora collection in real life. Needless to say, this game, no this alternative way of life changed me into a better person and a true atheist blessed only by my own intelligence and superior spy techniques together with my knowledge of 2fort. I tip my hat for anyone willing to give this amazing CARTOONMMOFPS a chance. I will finish this wonderful review with a quote from my favorite merc. -Le corny hen- Spy  -Billy 2014-06-27 16:36"
"I never thought i would have to say this, but tf2 is garbage right now. And valve doesn't care. They're more focused to make this like counter strike, a competitive ranked based shooter, instead of being the casual shooter it was supposed to be. Valve doesn't care about how the game should be, they don't care how the game ends up, as long as it makes them a quick buck that's all that matters. ♥♥♥♥ this."
1000+ hours. I have 0 hats. dont do what I did. worship Gaben = get hats.
2014-2016 Review: This game started out as a beautiful creation. This game was an absolutely unique style with its own cartoony graphics followed behind the most BEST ways of presenting the entire 9 man team and their personalitys. However sense the Gunmettle update this game has slowly started to slip from its former glory. This game started to try and copy CS:GO which ruins what was once so Unique about it.This game used to be a game that was a different experience all on its own. It was a team experience that honeslty brought a smile to anyones face from joining their first pub server to leaving their last this game used to be so Unique it would pull different players in from everywhere. Now its trying its best to stay afloat when everyone can clearly see the game is Dwindling from its former glory. Dont get me wrong. I LOVE team fortress 2. However this game has run out of update Ideas. It hurts to see that the updates are pay to join and have become pay to get a crate to just pay for a key for that crate. Unboxing used to be a optional thing and it still is but its being pressured to unbox more and more by valve with every single update. I have had my fair share of the whole experience in this game and this review is coming from someone who has seen it all.  I have seen the trader experience and the player experience this game offers. I have crossed the battlefield of mvm. I have run across the pubs. I have joined every update and I can conclude that this game is losing its spunk.  http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreyZarcovski/inventory/#440_2_4625059949   I have had a couple Ideas For updates (IE maybe medic makes some sort of mistake and one of the characters get to become female.) I know many of you agree most likely FEMALE characters would be a HUGE change in this game that would make both an interesing sfm AND an interesting update. It would be one that is completely free for the team fortress 2 community and it would be one that allows a female player to become a female character.  Regardless. This is MY opinion on it. I have watched friend after friend cash out on this game and slowly walk away from the memories they made with every step.   It is your choice to play or not to play. What role you take is all your own decision. Here are a couple videos of MY playthroughs to see if you still want to play or not to play.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRzCVGt_EwQ    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9naZAxpJJCY 
"Idea of new Competetive match making might be nice, but it actually looks pretty bad. I want to play endless gameplay of mann powered mode not just one ♥♥♥♥♥ map and then wait another hour till server makes ideal hosting. Also this up to date destroyed my evehud so I had to play with ugly default gui which makes game pretty unplayable and also I noticed some framedrops thanks to this up to date... Anyway what is the point to force people choose min 2 game modes in casual when I just want to play only one? Logic has lost sense. thank you very much VALVE or is it GOOGLE now?  I guess is time to remove TF2 for half of the year and then check if Valve did some progress. Now this game is just waste of my HDD space."
"TF2, you done ♥♥♥♥ed up and made this the worst update that has ever happened existed in all updates (not even sure what other updates are worse, but you get what I mean) why must you imitate ideas from other best selling games? You are already the best WAY before the updates. MvM, Halloween, even Christmas updates and themes were the best ideas you got. But now you are so desperatley trying to stay better than other gaming companies that you're making updates that imitates other games, its just sad. It's not fun, it's not what we wanted, it's not you Valve. Bring back the old TF2 update, take out the imitating ideas. You are a unique game and company, stay what you're best at (besides the micros) and give us that made us happy and enjoyed. Till then, I'm sorry for the harsh comment, but I'm speaking out like the rest of the people."
"I reccomend it a little bit, reason why New update doesn't allow me to play anymore*I click 'FIND A GAME', nothing happens* plz help me, I tried restarting my PC, doesn't work, I tried reopening the game, doesn't work, plz help me, idk what to do"
"Great game , its my 2nd day playing it and its just awesome , I love it !  I really recomend this game to any videogame players , boys or girls. For the first time I saw it before like 1 year , I tough its totaly crap , just kind of cartoon style fps with bad controls , but actually , its better than COD modern warfare 2 Plus it got voice chat ,so you can chat with your friends , and it too got normal chat. I love trading items from this game with friends ! Love this game. "
"Before this game, I used to have a life... I think. I remember the sun. The gentle breeze of summer air. The sound of children playing outside. Outside... yeah. I remember going out with... friends? They aren't shooting at each other and why no one is wearing a hat? Poor guys, maybe I should give some gifts around... But, wait. What is this strange triangular sandvich here on my hand? Oh, I remember, it's called pazza, pazzi, pazzia, piazza, pizza! Yes, pizza! And look at that beautiful sunset. That's some serious modding going on here! I need to save this moment forever. Wait! Where is F5? Oh no! Where is the keypad?! And the mouse?! Ctrl+Alt+Supr!!! NO! NO!!! What kind of hellish game is this?! I don't like this character, I wanna change! Where is Esc? Shift+Tab? Alt+Tab? Anything? Please let me out! I'll buy more keys! I'll do whatever you want! What is it that you want? My wallet? My soul? The blood of my first born child? Is all yours! But please don't let me trapped here without a tutorial!!"
"Apparently, Hat is much more expensive than a Rocket Launcher.  Hat is now confirmed as a ultimate weapon for World War 3.  10/Hats"
"Even though I wasn't so excited about the new big update, just because it became too much like overwatch, I still enjoy playing this game.   10/10 hat simulator, would give gaben more money."
"TF2 is like a candle. At the beginning it has all the wax and the light is very bright. Then updates are coming and wax starts to melt and light getting weaker. With last update all the wax is melted and light is gone.  For this 5% real competetive players this update might be good but what about the rest 95% casual players? Now they are forced to be competetive too? By removing QUICKPLAY they no longer can play what they want. They are forced to play maps and modes they don't like + with new feature of garbage matchmaking where you need to wait 10 or more minutes to join any game, also now they can't create their own server. Me myself was using quickplay a lot in early hours before I found my favourite servers (cheers FM for still running servers, they are the only reason I still play this game).  I don't recommend this game to anyone in it's current state unless you still have friends and favourite servers to play on. Valve don't care about community and won't fix the mess they did."
This game i would recommend to all genders and to most people that are from the age 11 to 40 mostly because it is so much fun and there are so many options
hats
Very funny game. The game never ends. And it's free!
"I recommend this game to anyone who has never heard of Steam before. I've been playing TF2 since 2009, and I wish I had instead been playing since the 2007 beta. This is a fun game to play, and the ability to use SourceMod to create custom plugins to add new features to the game is one of the greatest selling points in my opinion.  Look at all the wonderful gamemodes we've received such as VS Saxton Hale, Slender Fortress and many others.  As well, being a lover of beta/unused/cut content in games, and TF2 being jam-packed with beta/unused content....well it's just plain awesome."
"A really fun game, everyone should play it."
Pretty good game. I'd play it more often if it ran better.
"best game ever! Want a fun, fair game that you will come too time and time again? This is your game"
Everything is hat if you're brave enough.
it's worth a few hours of fun at least
"I honestly don't know what you're still doing here.... go play TF2 now, right now.....   Why are you still readin' !? was i not clear enough?   well what are you waitng for?"
"Team Fortress 2. It is For literally EVERYBODY. The Community is one of the best I've ever seen, and is CONSANTLY putting more into the game. The mods, and things are great, but why do people like TF2 then? The game it-self is not only free, but has HATS! I know what you're thinking, 'Hats in a shooter!?! Thats Obsurd!' But it works. I don't think I'm the only one who thinks this game is not only helping Steam, but Valve as a whole. They make money off of hats and the market, and we have Awesome looking hats/weapons that are fairly balanced, and have fun. It is truly the Win-Win situation at hand. Keep Making great games Valve!"
"Endless fun with hundreds of strategies, weapons, hats and funny situations all the time. Also really interesting in competitive way - prem highlander opinion confirmed."
"After spending around 1800 hours of playtime with this game, enduring at least six major game updates (within about one to two years of span), making many friends within the game, and having much bullsh*t with this game, it's about time I put it to rest.  Many times I've played this game, and questioned: why am I still playing this? After many scams, many encounters with aimbots and overall d*cks, many crappy unboxes and MvM loot, why do I still play this game? It's quite simple actually. It's addicting.  Team Fortress 2 is a First-Person Shooter released 2007 for both consoles and PC via Steam. Unlike today, TF2 was a normal everyday game, you had to pay to get in, and to play online. In June 2011 however, Valve decided to make the game Free-to-Play. As for how the game recieves money now, ask Mann Co.'s front office. They can let you know that now 100% of this game's earnings come from the Mann Co. Store, likely for keys, cosmetics, taunts, and yes: even campaign passes.  I was introduced to it around of Christmas of 2014, or Smissmas if you wish to go by the TF2 Dictionary. And that was the last time we ever had a 'real' Smissmas update. Now all we have are just Gun Mettle related updates and Meet your Match.   I love this game, and I hate it at the same time. Though, while my love has been strong for it, I just don't see myself supporting this game anymore. Let's get some things straight. The latest updates haven't been that great. Also the community, as creative and kind as it is at times, has to be the most cancerous thing I've ever witnessed. I can understand if it used to be such a good place, but with 9-year old kids going around, swearing to their hearts' content on an MvM game abusing the votekick option? It's gotten a bit too far. If anything, the people who downvoted this review just because it was a 'not recommended' review are the kind of people that prove my point about the community being cancerous. It makes No Man's Sky incident a joke. I'm not saying all of you guys are bad, as there are some good people. And there are some good parts of the community. There's just more bad than good in this situation, especially considering the many great people we've lost during the Meet Your Match update, such as MrPaladin.   Next, let's have a talk about Unboxing. You see all those players with Unusuals around ya? Either they were lucky and got some via unboxing, or they decided to buy some off of the market or some trading site. Same thing for the Australium weapons. What point am I trying to make? When a person says that the richest player is often the most skilled, it's not true..unless they happen to have a crap ton of hours, such as 9,000. I've only scored around 1,800 hours. And believe me, that is a long time. The unboxing itself though, is rather..picky to say the least. Not once in my entire TF2 life, have I unboxed an unusual. Not once. The most expensive thing I've unboxed was a CAPPER. 6$. Now, multiply the cost of a single key, 2.50$, by at least 115. Also add in account the MvM tickets I've used, the campaign tickets (count the amount of MvM tours I've cleared) I've bought and used, and items I have bought off the market. That's right. I have spent around $450+ on this game. And I could have done a crap ton of more things with that money than just buy a chance at getting a $100 item instead of something worth a few cents.   Now, the game itself. As the game gets updated and updated, more and more balances are made. Up to the point where some weapons are unusable or are just cr*p. Take the Sniper's only unlockable SMG for example. That thing used to have gotten Mini-crits by kills. However, they changed it to were it's a personal jarate. What?  Just..what?  I mean it doesn't even last as long as Jarate, so it makes the weapon ever so useless. And we can't forget about the phlog, right? Where the weapon is literally godmode for the Pyro if backed by a single medic? My point is, the game is broken. And not the fun kind it used to be. It's just a disaster.   A brief history of my time on TF2:  Smissmas 2014 - I like all the festive stuff.  End of the Line - What's going on?  Gun Mettle - I like the contracts, but not the skins and new crates.  Scream Fortress VII - I am heavily dissapointed for this to be my first experience with Halloween.  Tough Break - 'Are you freakin kidding me?!' No more Smissmas, Gun Mettle reskin, aaaand Spells are dead. Rip player inventories. At least the skins look cool this time.  Meet Your Match - I can say was an..okay update, ignoring the fact Valve enforced Casual Mode as a thing, and it tried to compete with Overwatch instead of doing it's own thing. Don't ask. I only play on TF2 Community Servers now, and it still hasn't changed my perspective on the game.   My point being, despite Valve listening to the majority (despite deciding to shove competetive down our throats in the form of 'Casual'), I just feel like that this game is giving me the middle finger. Everything dispises me in this game. Random crits, autobalance (which by the way is not only frequent for me, but it also is non-existant from Casual and Competetive), and even the community. If people question why I think everyone hates me, this game is the answer.   At it's current state, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. And I do mean anyone.  The music is great, the art and look is great, and even the ideas of the game are great.. ..but the balancing is awful, the game is glitched as hell (and not 'fun' as it used to be with the exploits), and just everything is a train wreck. Worse than Digital Homicide failing as a game company, I should add.  Oh, and also prepare for Pyromania 2.0: Team Pyro won. And at least three quarters of the team has '#TeamPyroWins!' on their username. Very offended.   ..however, there's one thing I must mention that I didn't add into the original review. As I said, it was the root of me when I came to Steam. It helped me form friends, make enemies, and even develop skills that eventually helped me later on with different games. I'm practically a good sniper on Borderlands because of my skill as the Sniper class on this game.  Everyone has different experiences. Some even are to be cherished and loved. However, I just suffered and suffered. While I had some smiles and laughs out of this game, I had more scars and tears shed within those 1,800 hours I've earned and the hundreds of dollars I've lost. And I just wish I could have the time I've suffered back, to have done something else that's enjoyable."
"Addictive, good pace, funny... and HATS, can't forget the HATS."
"Balanced, free to play game without the pay to win mentality, strong competive community,unique trading aspect, fun mods, SFM, frequent updates, and community involvement. 10/10 would recommend to those who haven't already downloaded it."
" What to heck, why you no play this game?"
I absolutely love this game! I've had endless amounts of fun and the pyro amuses me massively :3 you can experience all kinds of fun in any type of game play!
"Team Fortress 2 The best Multiplayer Experience Ever      Ofcourse, skill first then.... I FOUND A HAT !!!"
I got scammed out of my unusual gg.
11/10 would recommend  -easy to learn -fun people  -overall great game
"So far this is the best econmics simulator to I could find online. I have seen or been able to simulate door to door selling, monopolies, pawn shops, and one of artwork masterpiece selling. It's all in the game, and you can trade on websites or on a server dedicated to it. I can't believe someone could duplicate the feeling so well. Also, a bunch of people on my friends list insist that I just have to try the first person shooter mode of the game, maybe I'll get to that someday."
"Team Fortress 2 is one of the most fun games I have ever owned. It's face-paced comedic FPS that has a very addicting way of making one want to play more. The nine classes (Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy) have their own traits and balances that make the game fun, such as backstabbing (Spy), running faster than the other classes (Scout), and being able to rocket jump (Soldier). With tons of different weapons and a random number of classes of the other team, each round is never the same, so it never gets boring (unless one is playing Deathrun).  Team Fortress 2 is also been known as a 'Hat Simulator', which it basically is, considering the amount of cosmetics that each class can wear one the battlefield. Their are many different kinds of combinations of hats and miscellanious cosmetics that you never know which kind of combination you can obtain. The game has it's own humor that the characters create and sometime the game itself will cause something that will make one laugh.  If one is Free to Play, then one has the choice of being Free to Play forever, or buying something from the TF2 Store and becoming Premium. The game does not force the player to buy something from the store, although the downfall to being Free to Play is that one can not trade with other people and some servers make '[F2P]' appear at the front of your name. But these are just minor things that a player can bypass if all the player wants to do is play the game without the hats and such.  I fully recomend this game to anyone who wants a fast-paced FPS that likes to laugh at the often switch between comedy and intense battle. I recommend it even more if you like cosmetics that make your classes look awesome in your own way and the different varieties and stats of weapons that can change one classes health or vulnerability or even strength in damage. To me, Team Fortress 2 is my favorite game I have bought on Steam today."
"Has Hats 10/10 Best Game, Only have one Bank account though."
A funny Multiplayer-Shooter in comic style. At least worth a try.
"It's TF2. If you don't play it, then you should."
Pro Tip:    Always look your behind
What makes this game so much fun is that there's always something new everytime you start up. Definitly a reccomendable.
"It's TF2. If you don't play it, then you should."
"Haven't played much, but it's good so far.  But in all seriousness, this is one of the best damn games I've ever played, maybe even the best. The community isn't as toxic as that of CSGO or DOTA2, the gameplay is fun, and the characters have personalities you can get attached to. The best part about this game is, ITS FREE.  So if you want to beat people to death with a baseball bat as a Vince Offer clone, run around as a sword wielding black scottish cyclops (who is perpetually drunk), or eat sandwiches as a russian man who calls everyone around him babies, then this is the game for you.  Edit: You now be a Vince Offer clone with a little bit of Carlton Banks mixed in.  Edit 2: Matchmaking blah blah blah... It's not that bad, stop whining.  Edit 3: Stop whining and play the game. It's still a good game."
"I have almost 4,000 hours in this game. It's without a doubt my favorite game on steam. It was the first thing I played when I made my account in 2013, and I've been playing it so much ever since then. All the updates, the community, and the Varied gameplay all keep me interested enough into the game to still be a huge fan. But as of recently, Cheaters and Hackers have become tolerated by everyone and they come in packs and no one seems to care. It's honestly sad to see a game I like so much be ruined like this. I try to look past it but it's become too much to ignore, as much as it hurts to admit,Team Fortress 2 as it stands is officially dead. It's not worth playing. When packs of spies come in and aimbot the enemy team and no one can kick them because they autovote no, you gotta wonder what the VAC bans are even for. 0/10, Most likely not playing again. R.I.P. &lt;/3"
New system = trash. Bring back old TF2.
95% of my playtime was on a Mod Server ~ Slender Fortress. The other 5% is MvM and Casual.
This is the most addicting Free To Play game i ever played. I highly recommend this to you.

"The attack on Pearl Harbor, also known as the Battle of Pearl Harbor, the Hawaii Operation or Operation AI by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, and Operation Z during planning, was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii Territory, on the morning of December 7, 1941. The attack led to the United States' entry into World War II. Japan intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions the Empire of Japan planned in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. Over the next seven hours there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines, Guam and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time. The base was attacked by 353 Imperial Japanese fighter planes, bombers, and torpedo planes in two waves, launched from six aircraft carriers. All eight U.S. Navy battleships were damaged, with four sunk. All but the USS Arizona (BB-39) were later raised, and six were returned to service and went on to fight in the war. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship, and one minelayer. 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed; 2,403 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded. Important base installations such as the power station, shipyard, maintenance, and fuel and torpedo storage facilities, as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building (also home of the intelligence section) were not attacked. Japanese losses were light: 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost, and 64 servicemen killed. One Japanese sailor, Kazuo Sakamaki, was captured. The attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters. The following day, December 8, the United States declared war on Japan. Domestic support for non-interventionism, which had been fading since the Fall of France in 1940, disappeared. Clandestine support of the United Kingdom (e.g., the Neutrality Patrol) was replaced by active alliance. Subsequent operations by the U.S. prompted Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy to declare war on the U.S. on December 11, which was reciprocated by the U.S. the same day. From the 1950s, several writers alleged that parties high in the U.S. and British governments knew of the attack in advance and may have let it happen (or even encouraged it) with the aim of bringing the U.S. into war. However, this advance-knowledge conspiracy theory is rejected by mainstream historians. There were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan. However, the lack of any formal warning, particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing, led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7, 1941, 'a date which will live in infamy'. Because the attack happened without a declaration of war and without explicit warning, the attack on Pearl Harbor was judged by the Tokyo Trials to be a war crime. War between Japan and the United States had been a possibility of which each nation had been aware (and developed contingency plans for) since the 1920s, though tensions did not begin to grow seriously until Japan's 1931 invasion of Manchuria. Over the next decade, Japan continued to expand into China, leading to all-out war between those countries in 1937. Japan spent considerable effort trying to isolate China and achieve sufficient resource independence to attain victory on the mainland; the 'Southern Operation' was designed to assist these efforts. From December 1937, events such as the Japanese attack on USS Panay, the Allison incident, and the Nanking Massacre (the International Military Tribunal of the Far East concluded that more than 200,000 Chinese non-combatants were killed in indiscriminate massacres, though other estimates have ranged from 40,000 to more than 300,000) swung public opinion in the West sharply against Japan. Fearing Japanese expansion, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France provided loan assistance for war supply contracts to the Republic of China. In 1940, Japan invaded French Indochina in an effort to control supplies reaching China. The United States halted shipments of airplanes, parts, machine tools, and aviation gasoline to Japan, which was perceived by Japan as an unfriendly act. The U.S. did not stop oil exports to Japan at that time in part because prevailing sentiment in Washington was that such an action would be an extreme step that Japan would likely consider a provocation, given Japanese dependence on U.S. oil. Early in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved the Pacific Fleet to Hawaii from its previous base in San Diego and ordered a military buildup in the Philippines in the hope of discouraging Japanese aggression in the Far East. Because the Japanese high command was (mistakenly) certain that any attack on the UK's Southeast Asian colonies would bring the U.S. into war, a devastating preventive strike appeared to be the only way to avoid U.S. naval interference. An invasion of the Philippines was also considered necessary by Japanese war planners. The U.S. War Plan Orange had envisioned defending the Philippines with a 40,000-man elite force. This was opposed by Douglas MacArthur, who felt that he would need a force ten times that size, and was never implemented. By 1941, U.S. planners anticipated abandonment of the Philippines at the outbreak of war and orders to that effect were given in late 1941 to Admiral Thomas Hart, commander of the Asiatic Fleet. The U.S. ceased oil exports to Japan in July 1941, following Japanese expansion into French Indochina after the fall of France, in part because of new American restrictions on domestic oil consumption. This in turn caused the Japanese to proceed with plans to take the Dutch East Indies, an oil-rich territory. On August 17, Roosevelt warned Japan that the U.S. was prepared to take steps against Japan if it attacked 'neighboring countries'. The Japanese were faced with the option of either withdrawing from China and losing face or seizing and securing new sources of raw materials in the resource-rich, European-controlled colonies of Southeast Asia. Japan and the U.S. engaged in negotiations during the course of 1941 in an effort to improve relations. During these negotiations, Japan offered to withdraw from most of China and Indochina when peace was made with the Nationalist government, adopt an independent interpretation of the Tripartite Pact, and not to discriminate in trade provided all other countries reciprocated. Washington rejected these proposals. Japanese Prime Minister Konoye then offered to personally meet with Roosevelt, but Roosevelt insisted on coming to an agreement before any meeting. The U.S. ambassador to Japan repeatedly urged Roosevelt to accept the meeting, warning that it was the only way to preserve the conciliatory Konoye government and peace in the Pacific. His recommendation was not acted upon. The Konoye government collapsed the following month when the Japanese military refused to agree to the withdrawal of all troops from China. Japan's final proposal, on November 20, offered to withdraw their forces from southern Indochina and not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia provided that the U.S., the UK, and the Netherlands ceased aiding China and lifted their sanctions against Japan. The American counter-proposal of November 26 (November 27 in Japan) (the Hull note) required Japan to evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with Pacific powers. However the day before the Hull Note was delivered, on November 26 in Japan, the main Japanese attack fleet left port for Pearl Harbor."
"The people left behind working on this game at Valve don't seem to know what either they or the community want out of the game anymore, I'm hopeful that they'll notice TF2 exists again at some point in the future and dedicate some talented developers to working on it again."
I only still play it because of the good ol days 0/10
"Scream Fortress 2016 Update ----------------------------------------------------------- From what I have played in this past year of TF2 this was not a bad update. Free new Halloween contracts if you have previously payed the $5.00 for the last Scream Fortress contracts. New crate with pretty neat stuff that looked like people put work into. 5 new Halloween maps plus all the older ones and they seem pretty cool and into the Halloween spiret. Can't say that I'm thrilled with the added % chance for unusuals to drop in most casses, even if it is just for a time. Also there seems to be a down fall in FPS in a lot of proles games when entering combat, we're talking major even on good graphic cards shuch as a GTX 970 and a AMD FX 8350 which I have in my rig. But that has always been around since thw Gun Metal update but not as bad as this. Valve added a $13.00 taunt that let's you drive around the go-cart, great just great. Ga me play is still awesome as ever. Can't say I see any team based shooter matching the fun I have had with TF2 in many years, just wish Valve whould make this game awesome again.  9/10 good clean update no major down falls, only the fps and the taunts."
How do I close this
Ruined my life.
Medic Base All Mediguns allow the Medic to match the speed of their heal target
Don't think I've ever played any other game as much as TF2 and I still can't stop.
"Camaraderie, heroic feats and truly spectacular demonstrations of what humans can accomplish with a refined hand-eye coordination."
"An update in July 2016 has removed the game's builtin server browser, but it still works with steam's server browser."
"September 2013: 'Free to play? All right, I guess I'll try it out.'  RIP money. You will be missed."
"When I'm looking for nonstop action, without the need to get seriously involved in plot or invest a lot of time, this is my go-to game. With 368 achievements, 9 playable characters, a wide assortment of maps and styles of play, TF2 offers a good time every time.  Give it a try!"
"Probably one of the greatest time and money sinks that Valve has ever come up with -- Other than Steam itself -- Team Fortress still holds up years after its original release, regardless of what anyone is telling you. Yes, the hats start to get annoying and sometimes just a bit too flashy, but it still retains a brand of humor that is wholly unique in what it does.   For those unfamiliar, TF2 is a Class Based Shooter, based on the Team Fortress mod for Quake and Team Fortress Classic, which was a mod for the original Source Engine. A CBS is commonly a First-Person shooter, such as Enemy Territory, Battlefield, and Battlefront, although some CBS titles, like Battle of Heros, is a Third-Person shooter. TF2 is the former. Unlike the example titles, however, both teams are exactly the same, and neither side has any kind of special unit or weapon that's only available for that side (Unlike Battlefront giving each of the four factions a Unique Unit with Unique weapons). There are nine classes in total: Scout, Pyro, Soldier, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy. This is also quite a few more classes than some other game have had (Again as an example: Battlefront had only six classes per team, and some Battlefield titles, such as Hardline, only have four classes). Although it is a lot of classes, each one carries a bit of weight, and can be very important to a team (Although in general play, teams will have multiple members of each class, and some cases one class will not even exist during a game).   The Scout is a fast moving class that can get in close with a shotgun and blast enemies at close range, and then quickly pull out to evade a counter-attack. The soldier, while slow moving, is armed with a very powerful rocket launcher. The Pyro moves fairly quickly, and needs to get close to make use of his flamethrower. These are considered to be the offensive classes, and are meant to push for an objective.  The Demoman can create explosive traps with sticky bombs, and has excellent melee capabilities. The Heavy wields a minigun and has a very high amount of health, which makes up for his slow walk. The Engineer can build ammunition dispensers and automated turrets which will shoot any nearby enemies. These are the defensive classes, and are used to hold a position (Although Heavies, when paired with a medic, can also turn into a menacing offensive force).   The Medic, as the name suggests, heals team-mates in the thick of battle. Snipers, again as the name suggests, use a sniper rifle to pick off enemies from a safe distance. Spies can cloak themselves and get behind enemy lines to take out deadly players with a swift one-hit-kill backstab with a knife. These are the support classes, and are meant to help the rest of the team succeed.   As mentioned this game has objective based gameplay, such as capturing points, stealing intelligence (Capture the Flag), King of the Hill, and several kinds of demolition based missions. So, probably not as advanced as an Enemy Territory game, but probably a bit more mission related flesh than a Battlefront game.  So if you like team based class shooters, give TF2 a try. The base game is free, and the cosmetics are optional. There are a lot of extra weapons available to all players, and new content is added semi regularly, though mostly in the form of cosmetics. Sometimes new weapons are added too. Also, the community is still quite large, and community servers host a barrage of custom maps and content that can enhance the experience."
I stopped playing tf 2 a long time ago because we have seen not so much updates. But then tf 2 turned in cs go :0. Litterly it is the same ♥♥♥♥. Ill give it positive because maybe they would add cool battle cosmetics in cs go :D Eh maybe taunts.
this game is awesome! just a classic killing game with good graphics 
"best rpg ever!awesome characters of cats,funto play with paper.great puzzles.too bad no-one plays this racing game anymore.mike tyson looks young as ever.i was sick last week.and i got drain bamaged so half life 3."
i play spy is good job. go outside.
"I've played this game since 2010 on many different accounts never have I ever been more disappointed.  It really started going down hill in late 2014 then got even worse in 2015 now there is little to nothing left of old TF2 in this game. The community is full of undertale kids and whiteknight wannabe youtubers.  When this game actually had a community that wasn't this bad it was the best thing ever. You won't ever be forgotten 2012 TF2, You were the best.  EDIT: 12/14/2016 (-1) No, It hasn't improved. In a time of 5 Months they only increased the toxicity held in this game with half ♥♥♥ patches and terrible content. Please, Stop trying to make this game into CS. TF2 is something special to those who care dearly don't be a money ♥♥♥♥♥ valve.   EDIT: 12/21/2016 (+1) They're starting to listen, Not completely but enough to the point it's made an improvement on a dying system. They seem to be removing the need for keys (Thank you, These are way too inflated) and giving the players choice again. This is a better turn of events, All hopes towards what is left of the devs. Maybe another push for a better game will result in better reviews"
It's pretty fun i guess
Crate Unboxing Simulator 10/10  Spend more money in a day buying keys then you would in 3 months buying food for your family.
Mass murder with a hint of fashionable hats: a fine recipe.
The most fun you can have online.
i've wasted my entire life playing this game.
"This game   was   cool. Used to have nice co-operative and competitive gameplay. The original gameplay for the base game was enjoyable. Use certain weapons/classes with a degree of teamwork against the enemy team with a decent plan of attack or tactics, and score a win for your team. That's what this game used to be. Now the game is all about the microtransactions for flashy weapons and useless cosmetics. It has been transformed into a virtual shopping mall for kids and autistic manchildren."
"This game possibly hits the Greatest Multiplayer Gaming Ever.     No matter how fun it is. The hats are actually great to use.    Blame the people who don't recommend the game. I recommend it because it's useful for everything. and it's like Worms, (because in worms, you wear hats too) That's why.    It's also amazing how much the Game got popular.   Obviously. It's the most amazing game in the world. You now shoot babies and show them, who is crying."
What has TF2 become?
"TF2 Gamemodes in a Nutshell:  Control Points: Jump onto points, shoot stuff, yes  Payload: Push the bombcart  Payload Race: Push the bombcart before someone pushes their bombcart  King of the Hill: ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it Bobby   Territorial Control: *crickets*  Capture the Flag: Intelligence loss simulator  Special Delivery: Challenger rocket simulator  Deathrun: Crutch simulator  10/10"
"The fact that this game has completely been overrun by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hats and other pointless cosmetic items is the main reason I stopped playing this game and switched over to CS:GO, I plan on listing the big reasons why this game has gone to complete and utter ♥♥♥♥,  Reason 1: Too many cosmetics, not enough weapons This is pretty self explanatory, The fact that the amount of cosmetics compared to weapons is too damn high, 220 weapons compared to 1209 'according to sources on Reddit, dear god no', Therefore, if we do some handy dandy math from the ♥♥♥♥ing fourth grade, we can discover with a calculator *because who the ♥♥♥♥ does long division anymore?* that the ratio between the hats and the weapons are 5 hats per 1 weapon, Maybe even more,  Reason 2: Laziness I say this due to the fact that Valve seems to have a hard time coming up with new weapons for the game, but they have an AMAZING time coming up with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cosmetics that no one likes anymore at this point *Unless your a trading scumbag that sits on the BG servers,* If they would simply look at the Community Workshop, they would have so many new weapons, it would be insane, The ratio I mentioned above would turn to 30 weapons for every 5 hats. I mean, seriously valve, We have ALL OF THIS CONTENT right here, so why not ♥♥♥♥ing make use of it?  Reason 3: Cancerous Community The TF2 Community is like 9gag and Reddit had a baby, They use overused memes, etc etc, Also, The big reason that 65% of all players spam the Lenny Face, and other variants is simply another reason to hate the game, The people are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, I'm completely fine with F2P's As I think they are good traffic for the game, so long as the Sniper Mains dont come and ruin their fun  Reason 4: Certain Weapons. This one is a simple one, Some weapons/Classes need a big nerf, Some weapons/classes need a big buff, Some classes like Scout, Sniper, Spy, And even the Medic need a nerf. With the Medic, he only needs a slight nerf to his crit chance on his melee, Sniper's need to get the Huntsman nerfed, and need to get all of their melees nerfed to the point where you cant run around and get 18 crits in a row 'Yes, I have gotten 18 crits in a row with the Tribalmans Shiv'. Scouts need a nerf to their double jumping, as I see Scouts abusing the Double-Jump using the terrain or other forms to constantly be jumping around their target to the point where they are untouchable. This issue is enormous, and if it isnt dealt with, It may just break this game permanently, Next I move onto the Spy, The Spy's backstab hitboxes need a GIANT ♥♥♥ NERF, If they dont get that kind of nerf, cancerous Trickstabbers will come from the depths of Hell*Tower* and proceed to ruin the game for everyone  Reason 5:Traders and Overpay Traders and Overpay are a simple *lolno* trading tactic used by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who want to ♥♥♥♥ing get more then what they deserve, If you still dont get it, heres an example  One hat for Two hats and an additional Refined Metal, The person is getting a large amount of profit from that trade. As even including the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 'One weapon for two weapons,' method, used by the BG Moderator Combustible Lemon, and probably many more traders that are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s  Reason 5: Budget Gaming servers,  I'd probably say something, but I'm slightly afraid that Jamesderf is gonna come along and try to report me for putting constructive criticism on his ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers and trying to get me VAC Banned.  Hope you had a fun ride, you fantastic little ♥♥♥♥♥icles"
"Do I really need to state the awesomeness of TF2 at this point? All I can say is that it takes a really good game to still be not only popular, but creatively thriving 3 years after its initial release. TF2 is one of, if not THE, best cooperative first person shooters ever made. 'nuff said. Get it if you don't already have it."
"Vacuuming your wallet for virtual hats since September 30, 2010."
'Eventually well-balanced FPS' -Honest game Trailers    couldn't agree more 
"TF2 is a good game, it is fun in many aspects like characters, voices, hats, maps, etc Nowadays i just play this game to jump around everything and have some fun in community gamemodes like Deathrun, surf, parkour and fun servers. Over the years the gameplay of the game has changed, valve keeps doing small changes everytime, combining those changes the gameplay experience is not the same in my opinion, i think the game was more fun and attractive when i played the game for the 1st time, small changes like not being able to take your buildings in you hand to the spawn, the distinction between the rocket launcher and the rocket jumper, small changes to weapons... made me abandon most of the competitive gamemodes from valve.  The only valve gamemode that sometimes i play is MvM and it is getting more bugged whenever a big update is released and its matching system sucks.  Valve added so many hats that i don't even care about them anymore, i'm fine with my old hats.  I still recommend this game but not as much as i did before."
gg wp and end of the fun for someone
Remember when this game wasn't about hats?  Steam Awards update: this game is still trash
"Honestly, the last update removed the only reason I played this game anymore, casual jump-in, jump-out quickplay. I can't recommend a game that consistently gets updates that no one wants and damage the future of the game."

"♥♥♥♥ you meet your match update, youve ruined tf2 forever  EDIT: ok so now the latest october update makes me crash on training mode the bots just stand still and once i click or jump, the game crashes to the desktop  does anyone know how to fix this so i can at least play again?"
It was free
"woooooooahhhhh this game is fun! i like cartoons so i play team fort 2 with my friends. the community is so all the time and cartoons. i watch spongebob a honey bunches and oats so this game is perf 4 me! if you like cartoons and funny people then play team forest too with me. im about to go play right now, come and join me! leeeets plaaaaayyy!!!!"

"The game is good, the community is not. That's what made me give it up."
great game. 20 pineapples out of 13 girafficorns.
It is really fun if people are there for a friendly game! I love playing this with my friends
"This game is really fun to play, and you sometimes have to be careful about how long you play it. The rounds can go on for as long as you are willing to play, from 5 minutes to 5 hours and beyond. However, if you are sure to keep an eye on the time, this game is a blast with several different classes to play as and a bunch of maps to play on as well. This game has next to no story line, however. It basically consists of you and your team shooting, burning, stabbing, slashing, blowing up, and basically mauling the opponent as best as possible. This is not as disgusting as it seems, however, and if you manage to get caught up in the game it doesn’t bother you at all. In game, there is a store that you can buy items (guns, hats, etc. — for real money). If you aren’t doing very well in game, these are very tempting offers as most everything is less than £4. That being said, that temptation can and will sometimes cause you to spend money.   If I said there was not much violence, I would be lying. If I said there was a lot of violence, I would be lying. There is a TON of violence in this game. The entire plot of the game is killing other people. The entire point of the game is killing other people. The entire idea of the game is killing other people. Though in some way, I’m sure it helps promote teamwork (as you are always on a team unless in practice mode), this game is very violent to say the least. Also when anyone is killed or shot, they bleed all over the place for a moment. They bleed so much it’s unrealistic. If you hit them with a heavy bullet/rocket (eg: from the Demoman or the Soldier) they explode into several pieces. Despite all I’ve said in this paragraph, the people don’t look very much like real people at all, and that too takes away from the realness of the game and makes the violence and gore more bearable.  The controls in Team Fortress 2 are very simple, with very few buttons to press or any ‘combos’ that are overly complicated. You use the ’1′ key to select your primary ranged weapon, ’2′ to select your second, and ’3′ to select your melee weapon. Left click to fire/use. Some slightly more complicated classes use ’4′ and/or ’5′ also, but that is the most complicated part. To move you use the basic ‘w, a, s, d’, and to duck you use CTRL (at least on Windows, I’m not sure about Macs). Jump with the spacebar and ‘E’ to call for a medic."
Ducks are a true value in gaming history!
Its the best game!
"Hey random, watch out, theres a super subjective review ahead! After over 3000 hours of playtime in this game I can surely say that it is one of the best games I have played (yet), the 9 classes, numerous maps, many gamemodes and huge number of weapons in the game just make this a super-diverse game and very enjoyable to play once you figured out HOW to play it.  Looking at TF2 from an outsiders perspective: its free2play, first downside, it doesn't look too serious, theres are a ton of cosmetics and you can buy stuff from a store... seems pretty much like a pay2win game right? Well it isn't! Cosmetical items ALL only have visual effects on your character and don't matter, weapons however do all have diffrent, sometimes even completely classchanging stats, which may or may not be usefull, depending on the situation you are in. (Stockweapons being the most realiable ones in pretty much EVERY situation) You get weapons through item-drops, there are around 7 item-drops per week, the counter resetting on thursdays, so there you go, you can get all the items (except some special ones that have diffrent visuals but otherwise are just reskins of their 'normal' counterparts) through just playing the game! It might take you some time of course, but I think that being overwhelmed by all the unlocks and not knowing what they do as a starter, could more easily lead to frustration than getting them after each other and checking out what they do, then deciding if they are usefull or not. (Psst, you can also find HATS!)  Gameplaywise, its a pretty fun experience (occasionally annoying randomcrits and some unbalanced weapons aside) and you can actually have a BLAST playing it with your friends! TF2 has a class for every type of player, there's a stealth-guy, theres a sniper-dude, theres some big slow guy with a freaking minigun, theres some really fast dude, and so on, also it's, like I mentioned before, free2play, so whenever you are bored, why not jump into the game with some friends, have fun for an hour or 2 and quit the game without having spent any money!  Actually, if you get further interested in the game, it also has a competitive side to it, the skill ceiling is incredibly high, I myself for example have only managed to be semi-good at ONE of the nine classes, and am not able to play in a competitive division higher than steel (one of the worst), even with my 3000 hours of playing the game! Yes there are people like me that take that game serious! And you know what? It's amazing to play in a team of nice people and try your heart out just to lose because of teams that actually know what they are doing wrecking you... (You can't blame it on unfair unlocks or randomcrits either, both aren't existent in comp...).  SUMMARY!  Good: -many maps, classes, gamemodes, weapons, for alot of variety -actually not pay2win, pay2lookgood instead -huge trading community, if you are good you can trade your way up and own virtual items with real world value! -enjoyable competitive formats (go to playcomp.tf to get more info) -playstyles for everyone -visually appealing artstyle -ALOT of mechanics  -features amazing fun, hilarious moments and people falling off cliffs  Bad: -some unbalanced weapons (though counterable with an ounce of coordination) -occasionally annoying randomcrits (random critical hits) -hard to get into all the diffrent mechanics at start -actually pretty badly optimized, all the updates made the game run slow on 'casual' machines -as a free2play you only have 50 backpack slots, any kind of investment in the store however (which start at a few cents), increases your backpack size to 300 slots (defenitely enough)  P.S.: Theres quite some stuff I haven't actually talked about like the actually challenging co-op missions in MVM and community created gamemodes and maps! Go ahead and boot up the game in order to have a nice time! :D"
like any online multiplayer it takes a certain amount of time to get really good at it this one looks fun has a lot of settings in game and in the menu and I like a lot of settings I would recommend this game to anyone it's a lot of fun.
"After playing this game since 2014, I have to say that I love this game dearly. This game has alot to offer as an fps. Possibly the best fps for pc. Not only that but this game takes skill, alot of it. So overall this is a fantastic game, and I highly reccomend it."
"Nice game to play with friends. Without friends it is not that fun. At first its a bit hard to get into and it takes some time to learn it. But eventually you learn, you will make friends and find people helping you. There is nine classes to choose from or you can learn them all. All classes have different play styles. Nice maps and game modes. You can play this for fun or take it seriously. There is a lot of things to try out. You can try making your own content too.   Things I like about TF2: - art style and humour - funny characters - playing as blue medic on long payload maps - surf and rocket jumping - playing with friends - the moment when you find team work - nice maps and taunts - trying to make a map with hammer  Things I don't like so much: - trading, trade window not working properly, dealing with annoying traders - when autobalance/scramble makes teams even more unbalanced  - 7 scouts on our team / 7 spies on our team / 7 snipers on our team - when i would like to play scout for once and team has already 7 scouts - when the round is close to an end and everyone on team gives up and goes scout  I recommend this game, it is free and humorous. Hat."

Endless fun. Players versus Players or Players versus Robots. Game updates keep it evolving. The cartoon nature of the game is amusing alongside the mass carnage of this FPS.
"Team Fortress 2... is my favorite game of all time! Now the game has pen workd on for 9 years by lord gaben and he's fallowers. There are 9 classes in the game and they are   scout, he's the brick of the team,  soldier.... MURICA, pyro... fire, demoman... drunk as ♥♥♥♥, heavy.... POOTIS, engi, the guy who sits and drinks bear all day, medic... well... he heals his team m8, sniper... ♥♥♥♥ and  spy, the guy who backstab's people.  of all of them sniper,scout and spy are my favorite. But now back to the game. The game can be SOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH FUN, the game modes are fun but they can get boring and if you get bord of them there the community to back you up. And with valve adding new stuff every year to the game like the scream fortress uptades. OH YEAH I ALMOST FORGOT... HATS, HATS, HATS, HATS, HATS, HATS, HATS, HATS ,HATS AND MORE HATS. But i have to give this game a 10/10! ALL HAIL LORD GABEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Some ten year old told me to kill myself because i didn't have a hat on
very good game and lots of fun to play with friends
"I mean, I have spent 800 Hours of my life playing this game. From when you start to begin playing this game and you have no idea on what to do or how to play, you would probably still be having fun. Even after all this time I still really enjoy this.   Overall TF2 is an action packed game with a very good array of maps and weapons and classes to play. It is something I should really recommend you playing. i don't have the strongest computer myself yet I still am able to play this game so you don't have to really have an expensive computer to get it.  However there are some features about the game which I do find quite disapointing. Recently the game recieved a big update which provided the game with a feature called 'Casual Mode'. This was a bit of a blow to the head of the game. I'm not sugggesting that casual mode was a bad idea but I'm sure alot of the community agrees with my when I say that ' I don't want to have to wait 5 minutes to enter a game'. I much preffer the old matchmaking system where you can just search for a game in a matter of seconds and then join it. Yes there are still a few matchmaking issues which have to be fixed. FIrst of all I'm not sure if the game places you into matchmaking depending on your level becuase if so there is a problem. This problem is the fact that when I firce places casual weeks or even months after the update I was level one and then severely outleveled by other players. This was very unfair, not for me but for other players who are new to the game. A fair and balanced match is where the fun is. Not completely stomping a game on lower level players.   But outside of the casual the game is awesome :D. There are still many community servers which can be played on and also there is a very nice community ( from my experience). Please get game  I would also like you to give me your thoughts below about my review, tell me if you thought if it was helpful, or not and please tell me why you think that."
"I haven't had so much fun playing a game in years. I definitely recommend playing it! (I hope you're taking good care of my money, Valve)"
WE WANT QUICKPLAY BACK!!!!  Ever since tf2 has added casual and comp the game just sucks. Matchmaking takes forever!!!!!
i played it a few times its ok i got a few kills
Dat respawn time is gonna kill me.   10/10 would respawn again
My Bot Masters Makes me play this game all the time. i hate all the Non-Bot players
"R.I.P Pubs, gone but not forgotten."
I'm bored now. The game's new update made me suicidal. So here's my social security number. Now introducing TF:GO
After the update this game sucks ♥♥♥ harder than a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ crossed with a vacuum
"Used to be my fav game of all time. But with the new WaitYourMatch update, I feel, i can't play this game anymore. Now i know why TF2 youtubers started uploading Overwatch videos more often than TF2 videos. This game used to be one of the best games on Steam, now everyone is quitting it. Also, i miss u MrPaladin. Used to watch ur guides...Now he quitted TF2.No thumbs up for u Valve, until u fixed casual. #BRINGBACKPUBS and QUICKPLAY! Those good, good ol' days are gone."
Great game hours of fun. Met a lot of people playing this game who I have gone on to meet in real life.  Community is full of weirdos thats why I fit in so well :D
"I LOVE THIS GAME! A really fun game that feels like it has the right mechanics to be one of the most popular games in the world. Sadly, it isn't. But seriously, it's free... SO BUY IT!"
"Valve, it is time for you to either hand over development of TF2 to Hidden Path Entertainment, or hire community developers to work on it.  This game has been neglected, and needs more than the mere life support that the current development team is incentivized to give it.  This should be such an easy solution, which totally syncs with valve's core beliefs and past policies, yet no change in development has been made.  I am glad that valve employees work on what they love. It shows in every game that the employees actually love.  It is time to hand the development of TF2 over to people who have the same passion, so the current dev team can spend more time on what they really want to."
"Team Fortress 2 is, at heart, a gloriously simple game that's been created with style, panache and an undeniable love of gaming. It's the kind of game that you want to show to people who don't play games so that they understand and then either get involved or go away. There is life before Team Fortress 2, and there is life after. After is better."
"1 year ago: How have you not played TF2 omg  Now: -buys overwatch-  If valve brings back the good old tf2 pubs i'll re-write this review   Edit: What valve has tried to fix in the smaller update after 'Meet your match' doesn't really change my view on tf2, 'casual' still seems way too competitive. I still want pubs back  Still not as fun as it was before meet your match. 4/10 Gibuses"
"Dear Valve,  Team fortress 2 isn't CS:GO, PLEASE REVERT THE UPDATE    -Your's Truly,  EVIL BOOMER"
You have money?  Now you don't.       Unusual hat in TF2: $40  Overwatch: $40   Choose wisely.
"this game is the best first person shooter out there, its free and you can make a lot of friends"
Awesome Game!~ I love it!
By far the best free to play game I've ever played. Never gets boring and always has great updates. If you don't like killing other people then enjoy the awesome Man Vs Machine mode and kill tons of robots. 10/10 Will keep playing.  Update : STILL PLAYING
"Team Fortress 2 is an amazing Multiplayer game. It focuses on 4 things: Skill, Luck, Movement, and fighting. There are 9 classes in this game. Scout is the fast character. Soldier is the 2nd strongest. Pyro is the close-range. Engineer is the defense character. Heavy is the Strongest. Demoman is the demolition. Medic is the healer. Sniper is the far-range. And Spy is the stealthiest. Theres even MvM( Mann vs Manchine), a fun co-op mode, where you fight a wave of mechanical bots who carry a bomb and try to get to the end of the base. There a ton of weapons, hats, and maps. With Tough Break out, hopefully there will be another update. I give this game a 9/10."
That was very nice of this game . I like this one!
I was quite new to this game (I've played for like 30+ hours) and I was really enjoying it. The community was awesome and the game overall was a perfect way to have fun. Today I woke up and decided I should play some TF2 and an update popped up.It was about 700 mb so I kinda knew there was going to be big changes in the game. But this... What the hell happened Valve ? I tried enter a (so called) ''casual'' match and I had to wait for 20 minutes but it still didn't work. I'd played it just yesterday and it took me 30 seconds. What the hell were you thinking ?? I hope this gets changed ASAP otherwise I don't think I'll play this game anymore.
 PROS:   • Excellent - UI    • Cooperative Multiplayer   • Full customization   • Fully optimizable    CONS:   • Light Bugs/Glitches   • Repetitive   • Restricted    7/10 'Decent' 
community is meh developers are lazy but that's why we play it xd

"you can shoot stuff with stuff.  also, its basically a buggy hat simulator disguised as a first person shooter"
"This game is quite easy and fun, once you get used to it. My favorite part is playing on Dodgeball servers. I highly recommend that. It's pretty hard when you first start, and if you're using a trackpad like myself, but practice and you'll be good! It's also very helpful in MvM, or pubs. Have fun!"
"Team Fortress 2 is a fantastic game allowing you to play different class characters with different abilities. You work together as a team to achieve objectives and the game has so much to offer in terms of achievements, customization and learning skills such as rocket jumping and trick stabbing. I would highly recommend this game to everyone!"
THIS is truly the most fun you can have on steam for free from the game itslef to the awesome community behind it TF2 is a must try game
"Team Fortress 2 Is a Very Nice and competitive game.There are very nice peapole and a whole lot of Gamemodes.There are 9 classes (Scout,Sodlier,Pyro,Demoman,Heavy,Engenieer,Medic,Sniper,Spy) I Highly reccomend this awsome game!If you start playing it now you may have time to play on the update."
"HOLY ♥♥♥♥ IS THIS GAME GOOD!  My experience with TF2 has been a rollercoaster, awesome and not that awesome, almost quitting to getting my first 1k kills on a strange weapon :D.  TF2 is so diversed with so incredibly many ways to play you will be hooked straight in with its addictive multiplayer action all day long, forgetting of time.   This game has a ALOT of potential and you should try this out right now, THIS INSTANT.  This game does have some downsides- random unfair crits, unfair playstyles, the market has been turning ♥♥♥♥, and lack of new stuff at the moment.  The good sides are- u dont need microtransactions to look good(u can craft hats with ref as a fp2), there are lots of fun ways to play the game(TONS of weapons), this is, as i said earlier, not a pay to play game in any way,new weapons drop randomly so you dont have to buy them. Those were just SOME of the good things about TF2.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME! DOWNLOAD NOW AND HAVE FUN!"
There's almost no excuse to not play this game.
Nice game.
Probably one of the best games I have ever played. And it's free!
"i've loved teamfortress 2 since the start of it all the way from 2007 to 2016 but i cant say that anymore ,the updated ruined it for everybody, this game used to be amazing i would watch so much gameplay of it hoping that i would get a pc someday just to play this game, tf2 was the first game i downloaded on steam and i hopped in having so much fun.but that was before the update,before valva butchered tf2 and ruined it for everybody."
"Alright, I've played an absurd amount of this game, I love it. But Valve is entirely sending a middle finger to anyone who previously enjoyed the amount of customizability, for no good reason. For a long time I played completely stock settings and was completely happy, but then I saw all the FOV options and UI changes, stuff that enhanced my enjoyment of the game. Although I never actually got into UGC or anything like that I would play on fairly competitive servers and would try my hardest. Just a hop in and play kind of thing. Eventually I started to lose interest. But I was excited at the announcement of competitive because I thought it would bring me back in. I tried the start of the stress test beta and enjoyed it. Then they decided to kill the customizability of the game, why you ask? So when streamers played it, it all looked the same. This meant locking viewmodel_fov locked to 58 where previously it was unlimited cover a quarter of the screen because of this (they added some stupid setting to put it down and in the middle but thats garbage). Made it so you couldn't turn the viewmodel off (even for the ♥♥♥♥ing gigantic viewmodel for the minigun). The removed custom UIs for competitive (I'm not sure if they made it so you can use them now). AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF, they charge you 13$ CAD... TO PLAY COMPETITIVE? ♥♥♥♥ING SERIOUSLY? DO YOU NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY VALVE? ARE YOU KIDDING? Anyways, valve is doing their best so every player has to have the exact same ♥♥♥♥ to play competitive even if it doesn't give you any real advantage. Also the new quickplay thing if ♥♥♥♥ing stupid."
Nice game =D 
"TF2 is a really fun game; it's good for casual gamers, competitive gamers, and traders. It offers a whole variety of fun and interesting topics as well. The only thing I wish could happen is for the old weapon models to come back, especially the one-handed rocket launcher model. There are several glitches that involve skill to pull off, and in that case I think that Valve should stay away from eliminating these features.   I totally recommend this game to anyone who owns a computer. It's free to play and extremely fun :D "
Best Game  -need add new weapons ^^
"Honestly, this game was really fun. I had a blast and I've clocked over 1k hours on two accounts. But this recent update has completely ruined the game. I waited for 20 minutes with 2 friends to get into a pub, which ended being a bust due to a hacker on the other team. You can't 'pub' anymore and screw around. This game has taken a turn for the worst and I won't be playing it until TF2 returns to how it once was. Not only is the wait time completely inconvienient, but many custom huds won't work with the menu either.  Many people are quitting, Valve, take note of that. If you don't return TF2 to what it once was (And nerf wm1 of course) then you'll be losing more players every day."
"Easier to make kids cry on this, than CoD. 10/10"
gotta collect em all. there are more than 100 hats you can gather. its definitely the best hat simulator on the market. also theres a built in mulitplayer
bring back quickplay
stuff happen
"TF2 is a good game and its all about trading mostly . You can try out alot of fun gamemodes like Zombie Fortress , Saxton Hale , FF2 , Deathrun , Prop-Hunt and much more ...."
"Team Fortress 2 is one of the best free to play games out there with thousands, maybe millions of players on right now playing. it is really fun and 7 different classes to keep you ocuppied. there is scout class: fast and can double jump, has a very powerful shotgun that can kill an enemy with almost 2 shots. there is a soldier class, has a RPG, very power for taking out large groups of people or destroying sentry guns from long distances. there is a pyro class, has a flamethrower, good for burning large groups of people together and good for taking out surpport classes, spies, snipers and medics are easy to kill unless they have backup. there is a heavy. good for leading the way and taking out lots and lots of enemies at once, even harder to kill with a medic assisting them and healing them, unstoppable when the ubercharger is ready and activates and thats when the heavy is at its best, has a big gun and loves it like his own son. there is a demoman, has a grenade launcher and sticky bomb launcher, lays sticky grenades near doors and waits for a enemy to come through and blows them up which pisses some people off sometimes, their grenade launcher is good for corners and hitting the enemies beside the corner and taking them out, unlocks a sword and can charge at enemies and can kill them with one shot unless its a heavy. there is a engineer which its main weapon is the shotgun and of course its mechanical tools to help kill the enemies, the engineer can make teleporters; entrance and exit point, a dispencer, heals him and friends, and a sentry gun which kills and protects a certain area placed in, has a limited sight and cannot shoot from far distances, all the things can be upgraded to level 3 which is the last and best levels. there is a spy, has a pistol and knife to backstab enemies quickly and quietly, the spy is a quiet and sneaky basterd that pisses off the enemies so they rage quit the game so the friends get a better advantege in life and make their job easier. the spy can go invisable and hide from enemies to help make them live longer and hide from enemies who caught them backstabbing their friends and want payback. the spy can sap the engineers teleporters; both, dispencer and the sentry. the medic has a needle gun and a ubercharger that heals friends. the medic is very important in helping the offensive time. if medic and heavy combine and the ubercharger is ready they are invincible and not a force to be reckened with. the medic and shoot needles at enemies and when the needles hit the enemies the medic gets 2 health back for every hit. the medic gets 2 hp per second as a medic and which no class can do that. special ability is to ubercharge and be unstoppable for a short amount of time. and finally the sniper. the snipers main gun is the sniper rifle, its his best weapon and takes out enemies from a far and safe distance one at a time. he a sub-machine gun and is his secondary weapon for medium range combat. his machette is for close combat situations if a spy tries to take him out or tries to run away or a enemy comes and it becomes a close combat round. the sniper gains focus whenever he keeps his scope in for along time and deals more damage. his machette is a powerful weapon and can kill a spy and a scout in 2 hits, other classes 3 to 5 hits at least. thats all the classes ive covered. the maps are amazing and highly detailed, and new maps coming in from the community every month. new guns being made, skins and character customization to personalise your own class to make u unique and one of a kind. new abilities for classes and more to come, stuff to buy at the tf2 store (man.co) is what its called, i think its highly over priced but if u dont have a thing and u want it bad, go to the store and buy it (dont recommend that when u could just keep playing and wait to unlock it the hard way i better most of the time) ok thats covers tf2, hope u like my review and please rate it. i give Team Fortress 2 9/10 from: arcade"
TF2 is wonderful! I have been playing since 2011. I have made many friends and packed hundreds of hours of fun into this game. Thanks Valve!
Good game lived through all game generations. Still playing it everyday /m\. 10/10 pyro would bang spy.o/
"Worst update ever. Thanks Volvo! For me TF2 was a game to play for 15 minutes Now you made it a full-time job Another CS:GO-like S*** TF:GO? Maybe you will add bombsites, bombs and in-match shop? To buy weps you have? It's the best f*cking idea Destroy TF2 Destroy the best f2p game ever created Make it more cs:go Because, everyone likes CS:GO of course!  I really hope you will get back to the older TF2 ;( It was really the best You play hom much time you want Without obligation to play the whole map or else If you made the best game and the worst update for it I know you can do the best update  I survived Tough break, Gun Mettle But... THIS?!  TF2 is done There's no more fun in this game Thank you Worst job Volvo YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WORSE THAN THIS I don't recommend this game to anyone"
"Addicting to no ends, crazy good."
"Fun game, although very addicting when you get into trading like i do."
well I'm the Conga Queen what else should I say new game title: Conga Fortress 2: Hat Simulator is too great to be 'ftp' in my opinion but enjoy the hell out of it friends
"By attempting to revive TF2, Valve has accidentally killed it."
"It was the best game but after the new update its ♥♥♥♥. This was the only game a truely loved, now its crap. It takes ages to join a map and specially if you're gonna play with friends. And then you finally get in you come to a map you hate cause you cant even chose maps anymore wich it total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I hate this. F**k you valve. Change it back now."
"I like Team Fortress 2 cuz it is gud, It are go good with pizza. Now we got some Team Fortress 2 Lets go drive a car"
"Team Fortress 2 is a very decent racing game. First of, the vehicles in this game are somewhat strange. Instead of licensed vehicles we get stuff like Heavy, Soldier, and Scout. The vehicles are all different in their own rights, for example: the Heavy is the slowest, the Scout is the fastest, and the Medic is normal speed.  Classes in this game seem to be slightly broken, however. The Medic class vehicle is near useless on its own, and only serves a purpose when teamed up with a second vehicle. This will either serve to slow him down immensely, such as when healing a heavy, or let the teammate he is healing get away from him because the teammate, such as the Solider, is faster than the medic.  The level design is beautiful, but Take Two, in an attempt to create an immerse and beautiful world, forgot that these types of tracks aren't really suitable for racing, taking place in such areas as underwater, in long corridors, and intelligence rooms. But some of the levels seem to be made for racing, such as 2fort, but there is no finish line,  The fun thing is that each vehicle has a weapon to take out the other players. Of course, you can only take players that aren't wearing your vehicle colors. For example, the Heavy has a weapon that literally takes out everything in sight except that it slows him down to a halt, the Pyro has a weapon that sets fire to anyone and anything, and so on and so fourth. It seems similar to Mario Kart, with the various courses and powerups. However, it fails to capture the fun of Mario Kart, and instead going in an ultra-realistic direction that often looks quite boring and bland  The major flaw in TF2 is that there really is no direction as to where you should be going. There are no checkpoints and no wrong way markers. Valve did include a 'map' that changes between tracks but it is very confusing and really, isn't beneficial. These maps are nearly identical anyways, so changing the maps seemingly randomly only serves to aggravate the players more.  While the tracks and graphics are fun and creative, this racing game is lacking in many ways. I wouldn't recommend this game to game owners if they had access to a console, as this PC-only racer doesn't seem to try hard enough to stand out from the crowd."
I don't like the new update. Still a good game but i don't like the update
"Remade this a few times already, nevertheless...  At first it was fine. Now it newly changed from fun to csgolike-fukkin-serious even in this so called 'casual matchmaking', matchmaking system which maybe worked pretty well with mvm, but not with the game as a whole. Try to use the matchmaking system to get into the 'casual play.' Read a book about Moby D i c k (come on Steam, it´s a name) in the meantime, because you WILL wait. Then have fun with d i c k h e a d s cursing at you for being a spy/sniper/basically whatever on a certain map and yelling 'PUSH PUSH PUSH OMG' in the voice chat. Really, there are many more competitive tough guys than before. When you lose/win the game, the game is like 'okay that´s all, you can f*** off now.' and then youre off to the queue and periods of waiting again. You cant even finish the game as before. If you move your team´s payload faster than the enemy team a round before, you automatically win.  'Why the hell do we have four soldiers? Why the hell do we have two snipers? We dont need two medics, we need a heavy' Nah, this game just doesnt feel the same way it did before.  It even feels like Valve tried to make it more like Overwatch. I mean, you get some kind of experience points and you level  up....Why?  Why do we need that? Oh wait we dont. It´s ABSOLUTELY pointless. The game worked well 10 years without any of this bullcrap.  Oh and there´s finally the competitive mode now. That would be cool, unless the mode wasnt so broken. Nothing much changed from the beta. If someone leaves the game, nobody on the server gets nor loses points. Considering how many ragequitting, disconnecting people you will meet during your voyage, you wont get your rank ANYWHERE, unless you have a full party of friends to play with.   Thank god for the community servers.  Good job Valve on finishing this off. A lot of people had said that TF2 was dying before. Well, now TF2 is already dead. Huge changes would have to be made to fix it. But hey, it´s still free, right?"
It was a nice game before but now I can't even play a game because matchmaking takes 10 days to find me a game (actually it never found me a game).
ruined my life with hats  10/10
Old gay dudes and hats 10/10
"Team Fortress 2 is loaded with action. It's diverse, fun, challenging, and offers plenty of strategy and depth without bogging down the gameplay. What is really fascinating about the game is how the developers were able to take what is essentially an unsociable first-person shooter and turn it into a frag fest. The interaction among characters is dynamic, as each of the various classes has distinct abilities and weapons that are invaluable to the team as a whole. There are so many ways to exploit these unique abilities that each match is different every time. Not to mention that when the opposition changes things up, the game dynamics are kicked into overdrive. The average server will accommodate 24 players. That's a dozen on each team. There are nine classes to choose from: Soldier, medic, engineer, scout, sniper, heavy artillery, spy, pyro, and demoman. Sporting different attributes, the classes can be combined with relative ease to great effect. Each has different health attributes and moving speeds. The scouts are the fastest and most agile, being able to double jump and pull an about-face in midair. As you might guess, the heavy artillery operator is the slowest, but carries the biggest stick, so to speak. The different classes don't come with a bloated inventory. You know exactly what they carry and what they are capable of using to their best advantage. This allows you to make instant decisions in your head as to where they can be put to best use, like pawns in a game of chess. Aside from the principal weapon, each character will possess a secondary weapon such as a shotgun or pistol, in addition to melee weapons such as a bat or a saw. All of the classes are integral for the challenges that lie ahead. Engineers can develop plans to exploit or attack various structures that may act as chokepoints. They will also guard your own important structures such as bridges. Medics heal the wounded, and even have the ability to super-charge team members. They can send a spray of health to teammates within a certain range to help them heal on the battlefield. A medic can also employ a feature that grants him and his patient immunity for a few moments. This can be especially useful to get past heavily infested areas. Spies can get behind enemy lines and sabotage the enemy's plans or kill them stealthily by donning the enemy's uniform. Snipers are the most feared of the classes, from the enemy's perspective, as they lay hidden, picking off members one by one. Once you get shot, the respawing of your character seems to take forever, giving you more time to fuel your anger for the sniper. It's a very important class to be sure, but I find it kind of boring just lying in wait when others are running around shooting, ducking, and blowing things up. The environments give you a lot of tactical options. There are open spaces, plenty of obstacles to take cover behind, and towering vantage points where you can see the enemy coming for miles. The game goes out of its way to make things fair, and that's also evidenced by the fact that you can't set up unlimited weapons at one chokepoint and 'spam' your opponents. Each map corresponds to a specific mode. There is Granary, Well, Dustbowl, Gravel Pit, Hydro, and of course, a version of Capture the Flag. All these modes are variations on that premise, offering different combination of capture and control points. Some maps are more open, while some such as Well and Granary require you to capture points in a specific order. The game will go into overtime if there is no winner. It's sudden death, as there is no more health or respawing. When you're dead, you're dead. Communications in a game such as this are crucial. Fortunately you can communicate via headsets or short text-based commands, which you select from the menu. You'll wonder how you ever played a similar game without such instant communication. As of this time there is no artificial intelligence to round out your team. But I didn't have trouble finally getting into a game, although there was a little bit of a wait, which is to be expected. The controls are excellent, regardless of which character you are controlling. They are tight, accurate, and context sensitive. The voiceovers are extremely well done, bringing each character's quirkiness to life. There isn't a lot of in-game music, but there's so much action and sound effects going off you won't miss it. When it does kick it, it just sounds that much better. Team Fortress 2 is a must-play. It's the most fun you'll have being shot at in a long time."
"It's free, there is no reason you shouldn't play it."
A really cool game :D
"'I am very happy!' -Heavy, 2014"
"For a game thats been around for a while, it still keeps my interest. It is still one of my favorites and is really fun to play. With its different alternate classes and an encyclopedia of cosmetics, weapons, etc to choose from, I reccommend this game for any FPS enthusiast out there."
"this is a great fps with perfectly balanced and smooth gameplay. for team fortress two, valve have decided to approach with more cartoon-like visual effects and some weird an whacky items. know to many as the hat themed conga simulator, tf2 allowes you to customise every one of your nine classes' looks. the scout can run fast and double jump, but is near-to-useless at long range. he has a primary of a scattergun, secondary option of a pistol and a melee weapon only too whell known as a baseball bat. the soldier is a projectile-based class whith a primary weapon of an array of rocket launchers, which deal splach-damage and travel at an intermediate speed but can be reflected back to the damage dealer by the pyro's compressed air blast (right-click when using any of the flamethrowers, with the exception of the manmelter). the soldier has a secondary of a shotgun and the melee weapon of a common gardening utencil: the shovel. as you have probably already guessed, the pyro's main source of damage comes from his array of flamethrowers but with m2, he can helpfully reflect projectiles. a not-so-well-know fact is that if a teammate is on fire, m2 will also be able to put them out. now, in this review i am not going to cover all the physics of combo-critting as pyro, but here is a simplified version: you set an enemy on fire, then airblast him backwards almost instantly. the last step is to then shoot them with the flair gun, critting them and almost getting you a guarenteed kill on all of the lighter classes. the stock weapons for pyro are a flamethrower, a shotgun and a fire axe, but many pyros decide to give up their option of a shotgun to the more skill-requireing flair gun. this, in most scenatios, will be an upgrade as you can easily kill almost everyone, but then they lose the option of the more reliable shotgun, which is about 1000% more usefull against enemy pyros. the demoman, much like the soldier, is a projectiel-orientated class but his weapons travell in an arcing motion. he has a grenade launcher, a stickybomb launcher and a bottle to hit people with, but some people have given up their stickybomb launcher for a shield, with allowes them to charge and provides 1 critical swing whenever charging. others will also give up their grenage launcher as well, instead using ali-babas wee booties or the bootlegger, thus becomming a full demoknight. the hevy is considered a no-skill no-fun class who likes to stand still. he is slow and has a minigun, which can output amazing amounts of dps, especialley when paired with a kritzkreig medic. the engerneer is a clas who can build sentry guns. the medic is a class who goes aroung healing teammates and can use a variety of ubercharges, suck as crits, invincibillity and damage resilliance. the sniper is a class who can kill people from amazingly long ranges and finally, the spy is a class who can insta-kill players from behind when in a close radius and can cloak himself so that he is compleatley invisible for a shory amount of time. thank you for reading and i hope it has helped you if you are still new to the game."
"TF2 is a pretty funny game. I tend to play it, when I want to forget the 'stress' of csgo, when playing competitive. Due to that fact, that TF2 is made in the same engine, I'm able to just copy my sensitivity from csgo and play a bit for fun, without destroying my musclememory/aim :) (And it's free to play ;) )"
"TF2 used to be my favorite game, but the July 8th update ruined everything for almost everyone, and if they don't revert the changes or at least make casual games actually casual, then I'll cash out, sell my $400 worth of in game items, and never look back. Valve needs to remember why Team Fortress 2 is different than Counterstrike and Overwatch, and not having the ability to goof around in a truly relaxed environment destroys fun for 90% of the playerbase."
"The new update killed the game for me. I could tolerate VALVe not realeasing Half-Life 3, but this is where I draw the line. The got rid of quickplay and you need to select 2 GAMEMODES in order to play online, and basically, they told us 'f*ck you.' And you can only find official VALVe servers, cuz now there's barely any community servers left, at least not decent ones. And when you do manage to get into a decent game, after finishing it, it boots you out on your @ss. It also punishes you if you leave before the game finishes, and there's a long cooldown before you can try again. Sure makes you want to play Overwatch more than this game, huh?  When VALVe undoes what they have done to their most popular game and fix everything back to the way it was before, then I will change my review, but until that happens, I simply can NOT reccomend this game in its current state.   Congrats VALVe, you f*cked up again. No HL3 was one thing, but you crossed all of us this time. Let's see how you feel when your fanbase starts to slowly, but progressively, dwindle into dust..."
"I used to love this game wholeheartedly and it pains me immensely how Valve basically destroyed this game piece by piece.  Playing PvP is frustrating as hell as the server decides to switch you to the other team during rounds! I have absolutely no problem with team balancing between rounds, but balancing between rounds completely demotivates me to give my it my all!  The game mode that made me play a ton of TF2 was MvM. This is a really fun gamemode that reminds me a lot of Tower Defense games. But you don't place towers around the map, rather you as a team are the towers mowing down enemy waves.  But this mode is unplayable! Trying to join servers via matchmaking is an impossible task as you will always be greeted by a prompt 'round is already running'. You either have the choice to re enter or leave the server. Re entering will only result in this prompt being displayed to you again and again!  But hey, you can always use the server browser to join servers! No you really can't for MvM since majority of them don't allow you to join in any other way than via Valve's crappy matchmaking.   I don't get how a game that ran so smooth and perfect can be made so broken in just a few messy updates! TF2 is not going to die off because its competitors are vastly superior but rather because Valve itself does a well good job of letting TF2 die."
good game mates
"Tired of old realistic war shoters?  Tired of team co-op that this game supposed to be? Tired of playing game?  Well I bet you didnt say yes to any of those above  BUT HERE IS  THE REVIEW ANYWAYS  From the developers behind good old games that will never have third sequal comes the game that will stab you right in the fu?king back.  You play as one of 9 classes... Play... ................play. That is the world I havent heared a while now, since all I been doing WAS FREACKING TRADING  Tired of being forced to play that CS:GO Well no more, since this game just became its rip of with new update.. Back in my day this was a decent game, with bright future, but then it took CS:GO to the knee,   Still good game  Have fun"
"Great game, so fun! Trading is awesome too! :DDD"
"I like this game a lot. The community is nice and the trading is fun. I always am anxious to come home to play right away for a while, then study. It's grown to be a part of my mind. Not big, but a part nonetheless."
"For as long as I've been playing Team Fortress 2, I have never found myself being bored. The constant updates and additions keep the game fresh and fun. The game is starting to become more of a social experience, what with the conga lines and friendly players on opposing teams. My only concern, however, is that Team Fortress 2 may be rather intimidating to the newer players, maybe a bit overwhelming. With all of these new cosmetics, a vast arsenal of weapons, and the ability to turn any bloody battlefield into a parade has changed the face of shooters. I'm afraid that newer players may start playing and will be immediately turned off by either the vast personalities and items, or just the overall sillyness. Regardless, TF2 remains a great game over 7 years after its initial launch. Props to you, Valve!"
" Help, I've become addicted to this game. No joke. 'Why?' you ask? Let me sum up my experience so far. : )   First and foremost, the game is quite original with it's colorful and quirky characters, which I've come to absolutely adore. Each character has their own (stereotypical but hilarious) personality, and it's really fun to watch them interact and talk. Being able to play as each is a blast.  Community wise, I've met a handful of awesome and cooperative people who are great to play with. You never know who you'll run into in online games, but it's totally worth it when people are friendly and talk to one another. Once in a while, you'll come across players that are complete jerks, but I assure you that you'll find a server with a bunch of dorks you can party and have fun with. XD  Apparently I have been on TF2 for only 157.8 hours (total), but it feels like at least a year. I plan on continuing with this energetic and playful game for a long time to come.  Aaaaaand I think that's all! Oh, and before I forget... Just a word of advice to you newcomers... Make sure to get hats other than the ghostly gibbus. ; )"
Vri gut game but   VACation :((((  
Please help me...  I can't stop playing it...  So much hats...  So much weapons...  so much Conga!
It's good for your soul.
"I would highly recomend this game to every fps fan, gameplay, trading, community is top notch!"
"In the new piece of ♥♥♥♥ update Meet Your Match Valve took everything we love about tf2 and just butt ♥♥♥♥♥ it. theres no more pubs which is really why I don't like this upate but don't worry! with the new casual mode thats totally not the same as competitive you can now wait for 2 hours just to find a match! theres nothing casual about casual mode once you finally join a game the teams are so unbalanced that I want to hang my self and everybody leaves and it's not fun anymore. and it kinda forces the playes who loved pubs to play on a community server pubs their sometimes good depends on the server you're on. then with the new changes like how Valve changed the noise that some grenade launchers make, it now sounds like an old man farting. then with the new update mostly every server I join the item servers are down. but with the new update Valve made tf2 not fun anymore.  *This review is old so the things I said in this review might of been patched*"
"Good day potential or existing player! I suppose you have came here to see feedback of the game,thats why im going to list pros and cons of this game. Pros Plenty of gamemodes,with a lot of maps to choose from. Regulary updated with content. Bunch of existing content already. 9 Classes with different play styles to suit players needs ,which each can be countered with another. Game endorses teamwork to win. Its always more fun with friends. Votekick. Cons No matchmaking. W+m1`s can annoy the hell out of you. Class stackers can get annoying too    Tip: New players,read up on guides,watch tutorials and ask people to teach you,who knows,what potential at class you have.  And lastly  I wish you Sir/Madam a wonderful experience in the world of Team Fortress 2.  "
My first multiplayer game and my best one :) ..
"I never was a fan of the first prson shooter games, I just thought that they were all the same Call of Duty style gameplay and nothing more. *Course I forgot that games that I've played in the past like Spyro 3 had some first person gameplay* This game eventually chnged my mind on that. Team Fortress 2 is a sequel to somewhat lesser known Team Fortress. Some of the basic missions in the game include capture the flag where you have to capture the enemies intelegence, attack/defend where one team attacks and the other defends, payload where one team has to deliver a bomb to the enemy, and various other missions. Then there's the co-op mode, Mann vs. Machine where it's one team defending an area from an army of robots. The gameplay is a lot of fun as there are tons of different choices in class and weapons. It helps experimenting with them to see which class you are better at and which weapon works best for you. Unlike in the first game where everyone had the same line, each class member: Scout, Soilder, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy have their own personalities and dailouge. just listening to them talk or watching the Meet the Team series gives you a good idea on what these characters are. one thing that I'm not fond of are the mann co creates that ocassionly appear in your inventory as drop items. In order to open them, you need to buy a key at the mann co store for about $2.30. You think by now they would've been a nit more friendly and just redused it down to a buck instead of people having to deal with crates pilling up in their inventory and can never sell. There are also Stranges, Vintage, Unusual and other named titles to make the weapons or asscessories sound more vailuble, but I don't really care for it that much. I'm just glad that I bought the Mining Light hat for Engi before they stopped selling them. So yeah, TF2 is a fun first person shooter game with it's missions. And if you get tired of that, thre are tons of fan made servers on other styles of gameplay, Saxton Hale Mode, Zombie Survivl, servers for trading or hanging out at like all of those FiM servers, the list never ends. And since it's free, it's a good deal, the only thing you have to pay for is for buying stuff at the Mann Co. Store, unless you get lucky with trading."
"Nine classes, loads of weapons and a ton of fun. Such a great game that everyone should try at least once.   And I think I've played way too much of it, send help plz.    Did I mention hats? Lots of hats."
Games 75% even though it's a free to play.   Good job Valve 11/10
"before meet your match tf2 was decent, after mym valve dang ♥♥♥♥ed up  they removed quickplay and replaced it with some kind of discount competitive mode. it now takes like a decade to find a decent server, when you DO find that server you'll probably end up losing due to tryhards trying to rank up and like half of your team will leave soon after resulting in one sided wins since they also removed auto balance. IF I wanted to play competitively I'd buy overwatch in a heartbeat. for most players valve pubs were their bread and butter."
TF2 is the best game ever it has amazing co-operation and teamwork when it comes to mvm. This has got to be a must have game for everyone :).
"Valve,   When we asked for Competitive Match Making, our request was for you to set aside some of your VAC secured servers for Competitive players to both avoid casual players and the admin abuse frequently found on community servers.   It was not a demand for Casual Play to disappear.   I, as a casual player, do not want to interefere with those that wish to compete...  Nor do I wish to play on maps that do not entertain me....  Nor do I wish to rely on community servers for play without hackers, or bizarre house rules that again make the game 'unfun'.   The addition of Competitive matchmaking is GOOD! Players need MORE options. But you should be very reluctant to REMOVE EXISTING features. From my vantage point, 'Casual Play' is almost indistinquishable from Competitive Matchmaking.   Thank you, at least, for the community market. $18 store credit recovered from cosemetics makes your decision a lot less painful.  -Foxfire_kadrpg"
This game is like a women it eats away at your wallet until you realize what its doing but then again this game is sexy just like women.
"This game is funny. I had to delete this game 3 times before I started to like it. And remember, do not play to show the expensive items that you have, play for just one reason.... for fun. Until you start in the trading community, where you will forget all the fun.   btw Selling sister for 2 keys"
"After playing about 300 hours on TF2 for the past few months, I can say that this is a very fun game(And I'm not even a gamer)! TF2 isn't your average FPS, and that's what makes it unique! It's quite balanced, with tons of different and unique weapons, not to mention LOADS of hats/cosmtics and taunts(Which is a thing I've never seen in any other game and are pretty awesome). What attracted me to the game were the trailers made by Valve and how they brought so much character into each class and after that they grew on me. I really enjoy the crafting and trading, but what I really enjoy is how much more the game is besides playing the main game modes(Control Point, Payload, MvM, and King of the Hill)and that the community has managed to make it's own(Prop Hunt, Slender, Death Run, Randomizer, Versus Saxton Hale, ect.)! There isn't much I dislike about the game besides the frequant confrontation with immature and roudy people under the age of 15. If you're looking forward to getting into trading, be sure to check sites like Backpack.Tf or Trade.tf for the pricing list, it's very helpful. :) Love it, love this game!!"
"TF2 is a great game with great classes. The action is fast paced and plenty of maps to choose from. From pubs to competitive, it has something for everyone."
Best first person shooter ever so far. Top Notch Clan Best Community! Fun players!!
Interesting... very very interesting
"Great game, no question. Though is was better without items or hats, and now it's almost all about trading, still a fun multiplayer game to play."
"I have over 1000 hours in this game now i thought i would re-edit my review  Team Fortress 2  I started playing this game almost 10 moths ago, and i have invested over 1 and a half months into this game already. I have never invested any money in steam(till now, dont know about future), i have got everything from trading, all my games, i have been scammed a lot, which is the only real bad thing about tf2, scammers, phishers, and sharkers, quite a few of them.  Positives 1. Its a great place to meet a lot of people. 2. Its a place where some very very good people become a very important part of you 3. This game gives you enjoyment and endless fun, if u feel bored, u can just switch to hightower and have fun, if u feel like rolling on a few people, join in badwater, if u feel like just training join an mge, if just feel like trolling just join some freinds and troll around. its not a campaign and fun never ends 4. People say only games like cs go and dota have competitve, but i believe that tf2 has a competitve side that not many people see, and its really amazing 5. If you ever feel like its too quite or u feel bored, join a trade server, There will be a few kids screaming like crazy with their squeky voice, if it gets too much , just mute em. XD  Negatives 1.Phishers, scammers and sharkers exsist.  BASICALLY,  You should Try it, trust me, im a teenager and i am addicted, but in the best way possible, There are also these moments that you will remember as the best times u had in gaming, after 8 months, im honestly nostalgic writing this and eventualy u will realise this community is amazing, just amazing.  I RECOMMEND, definately Recommend!! Please try it, you will thank me. :3   Leave a rate up! :D"
"This game is fun for all ages. It is filled with lots of action and a massive multiplayer. With many different characters to choose from and getting to play with their unique loadouts. Their are also many different maps and categories to play from. Also, Valve keeps you updated with new things that were added in Team Fortress 2 and new problems that were fixed. All in all TF2 is an all around game for anybody and everybody to play."
this is soo good game my rate is 10/10 cus its fun and good game try it out i really recommend this game
"I have played quite a bit of this game over the last 2 years, and I thought it was amazing.   Was   amazing. The popularity of TF2 was at its peak in 2012, thats when I picked this game up. Back then, the game was awesome. It had (and still does) a very good community, frequent updates and very supportive devs. now I feel like Valve is making TF2 slowly turn into CS:GO. First it was the   gun mettel   update. It Introduced Contracts (operations) and Default Gun Finishes (skins). It also added a wear system and rarity classes   identical   to CS:GO. Then there was the   Tough Break   update. This update was the time I said 'I have seen everything this game has to offer. Time to move on to something else' I would Recomend this game, but I would recomend it more 2 years ago. thank you TF2 for bringing a smile to my face."
One of the most popular shooter games in which a particular passion for the game all day . 10 OUT OF 10
why did they ♥♥♥♥ it up? it was so good
"From the time I started playing until now, this game did not disappointed me much and continued to make it better in some ways to give you fun and joy for the experiance you receive when playing this game."
"The Best multiplayer FPS of all time. No other FPS I have played has tested my reactions and aim so much then this game, the movement is amazing, characters and weapons are balanced and the hitboxes are not as bad as everyone thinks. After 9 years it is still one of the best multi player games made, no other game has topped it yet."

"Even after 3000+ hours with a few crappy updates and a few updates that after a little work became great, I still can't leave this game alone.  Love this game to much to just drop it and let it die with a few bad updates."
"I'm a writer... sort of. Sometimes I sit down and write stuff about videogames, but not very often. It's nice, because I like to talk a lot and when there's no one around who wants to listen to my inane ramblings I know I can draft something up, throw it onto the internet and there will probably be *someone* out there that cares to read it. But that’s besides the point: I write because I have a lot of thoughts that go nowhere, and I feel the necessity to share those thoughts with other people.  But coming up with words to describe TF2? How am I even supposed to do that? This game… it’s not a game anymore for me. It’s the background noise of my life. I can’t imagine a time where I didn’t play it. I can’t imagine where my life would be if I hadn’t found it. It’s been with me through so much. It’s taught me so many things, it’s helped me meet so many great friends -- ♥♥♥♥, is it weird to say that it’s changed my life? Because I think it has. And I think that’s a good thing, too.  I have over 900 hours played. How did I get here?  So yeah. TF2. It’s a team based shooter where you get to pick from one of 9 classes, all of which you probably already know from numerous internet memes. You and your teammates must work together to complete an objective -- whether that’s capturing a point, pushing a cart, getting a briefcase or preventing the enemy team from doing any of those things. Usually there’s a lot of running around and shooting involved.  Graphically? It’s pretty great. I use this game as evidence that aesthetics in gaming mather so much more than actual graphical power. The art style still holds up even after 10+ years and looks to not be falling out of fashion anytime soon.  Performance wise? It’s… okay. It’ll run on most of everything, but there’s definitively a certain level of spaghetti code going on in here. Weird bugs and performance issues are abound. Far from perfect, but it works 90% of the time and that’s enough for most people.  Gameplay wise? Well, if you’ll pardon my french, it’s ♥♥♥♥ing sweet. TF2 is both amazingly simple and ridiculously complex. A new player can pick it up and learn how to play it in a single sitting, but a veteran could play it for years without fully mastering it (thus, over 900 hours my friends). You can team up with your friends and screw around all match and have a grand ‘ol time, but there’s a certain beauty to getting good enough to stomp an entire pub by yourself. And then you can go online and find a team and actually compete and…  Over 900 ♥♥♥♥ing hours. Jesus.  It’s not without its flaws. The developers, mostly. I love Valve as much as the next guy, but god damn have they made some stupid decisions regarding this game. Updates are few and far between, and lately seem to add mostly cosmetics. Each bug fix brings about 15 new bugs. The game has ♥♥♥♥ balance, and this is coming from a guy who stuck with LoL through seasons 4 and 5.   TF2 is plagued by a myriad of technical issues that provide constant annoyance, but here’s the trick: The actual game beneath it is so good, by the time you start noticing, you won’t care.  The biggest selling point by far is the community tho. Yeah, bad apples and whatnot -- we do what we can to deal with those -- but you’d be hard pressed find a group of more creative, dedicated, hard-working people than the TF2 community. 10 years later, servers are still being hosted, mods are still being coded, content is still being made. There’s still competitive leagues active and moderated, and entire youtube channels dedicated to the game. It’s ridiculous in the best of ways, and it makes the game feel alive in ways other just cannot.  Feel like finding the next big thing you can play with your friends? Need something else to invest afternoons into trying to get good at? Wanna meet some of the most awesome, passionate people on the planet? Or maybe you’re just into it for the sweet, sweet Heavy x Medic fanfics?  Then give TF2 a shot. Yeah, it’s probably my favorite game. And there’s a good chance it’ll be yours too."
I play only to visit with friends around the world...and trade a little. Valve has ruined the fun with excessive secuirty features just so they can avoid doing any work. They never give answers any more and a parrot could do the Steam Help job just as well bacause all I am ever told is to 'Look at the FAQ page for answers'. I only give a thumbs up because I have a lot of friends here.
I once tried to play Crysis 3 on the maximum settings on my toaster laptop from 2012 just to see what would happen; my computer froze and shut down and wouldn't start for a couple of hours. This really delayed some important stuff I was gonna do on my computer.  I once used the maximum settings allowed in TF2 to see what would happen; I got 20 fps but got a triple pipe airshot on an overhealed rocket jumping soldier and my computer only froze twice without shutting down.  10/10 can play on the maximum settings and watch porn afterwards
"Been playing this game since 2010, i've met some interesting and awsome people on this FPS game on some community servers. The 9 classes are psychotic mercs but in a good way and have some interesting stories to them from SFM videos and the TF2 comics. The many different weapons makes for good changes in pace and strats, and, of course, cosmetics. It gives you many different loadouts and play styles. You could even add mods for more playability. There are micro transactions but you only need to buy from the mann co store if you need to be premium otherwise you can save up metal and stock refined metal to trade or buy items at a cheaper price on the Steam Community market.  But I enjoy the community servers and different game modes Payload, Payload Race, SD Doomsday, Pass time, Versus Saxton hale, Randomizer, x10, CTF, koth, Control Point, mann vs machine, surf, trade servers, mann power, Halloween mode maps, and much more. And don't forget now there is competitive and casual play as well, if your interested.  There is a skill ceiling in this game that keeps you practicing on specific classes you play as and has a steep learning curb with teqniques like stair stabs, surfing, and rocket/sticky/sentry jumping.  Although many people say this game is dead or down right terrible I disagree. Sure it has some problems but it has a very good Community with big events like Tip of the Hats. As i said before the TF2 characters are more interesting and have a very crazy but also lovable personality and they interact with each other in game."
This game is like having a cup of tea with an old friend.
10/10 still more robots to destroy
"I think we all know why are doing, this, right?  also tf2 is my favorite game after so many hours and i don't get bored of it, but Valve does something bad with the updates sometimes..."
11/10 would play again
this game is absolutly awesome... every class has its unique skills and every single one of them is great graphics are not bad and never get boring this game may look hard at the first time but when you reach 20 hours of playing then you can't stop playing and you want to play more and more... but the best part is gameplay...controls are very smooth  after 2 hours of playing you can find the class that is made for you... I played a lot multiplayer games but from my opinion this game is the best multiplayer game ever made  10/10 thank you valve
"Over the years the game has gone through many changes - good and bad - but no other game manages to pull me back in like TF2.  Nearly a decade later, the game still has a solid community with an active player base. The gameplay and mechanics have yet to me matched by another game, though some have tried.  By far my most played game for a reason."
Very interesting game with lots of HATS!
"Team Fortress 2 Is a team based FPS game where Team RED and Team BLU fight agains each other in a variety of gamemodes such as 'capture the flag' and 'Payload'.  When you join a match you can chose between 9 unique classes instead of just play as the same character and just switch weapon (but each character can change weapon). The classes you can play as is Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy.   Team Fortress 2 is the best game i have ever played, and the reason i think it's such a great game is becasue it's not like the typical FPS games like Battle Field and Call Og Duty. Instead of a realistic FPS game, valve made the Team fortress 2 graphics more cartoon-ish. Also a thing to mention is that you can customise your character's miscs and hats. You can even look like batman, like, who doesn't like batman.  So if you like FPS games, i highly recomend you to try Team Fortress 2."
"Where I found my uncontrollable urge to mercilessly burn everyone and everything to a satisfying, crispy pile of ashes, only further adding to my bloodlust--I mean... never mind. I have TF2 to thank for making me constantly question my morals. (:  But in all seriousness, this game will forever be a favorite of mine. The community is still thriving despite all these years, which is the main reason why this game is still as popular as it is. I've met some pretty incredible people over the years, which speaks for both their skill in the game and just who they are as my friends. Maybe we don't play with each other as much as the first year we met, but we do talk when we both have the chance and play some of the greatest games on occasion. An experience that I wasn't expecting, and one that I'll never forget."
Howdy.  • Have a furry avatar. • Wear a Gibus. • Play Sniper. • Trigger people.  Good game.
"awesome game, you people should really get it if you want a free game"
The best game in my life idk what i should say.......GG and All my friends are from this game.  Love is like burnt shrimp. - KNN 2016 -
"WTH happened to this update? I find a server (3minutes minimum) got into the game, the game ended (in few minutes) now I have to go back to the lobby and find another server? ugh. From fun to a waste of time. be sure to have your smartphone with you when you play this, coz you need to play some games in your phone before you can get into the game that also end very soon. HORRIBLE UPDATE."
"One of the best games ever! 10/10 :D  Edit: I really don't get why people are freaking out so much over the new update. Competetive is something we have all been waiting for and imo it's awesome. 'B-b- but it takes 20 minutes to get into a game!' No. It doesn't. Competetive usually takes 2 minutes for me. Think about other games. That's literally the same as in LoL for example. ALso the new casual mode. 'Oh my god they REMOVED pubs?? I'm never playing this again valve' Just stop. I have played over 20 casual matches so far and i see little to no difference from the old pubs. There are still spycrabs, hoovies and other idiots that don't play the objective. What I like about the leveling system in casual is that you cannot lose exp (but i think you gain less if you lose). THIS is very good, cause it encourages players to ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME. Everyone wants to level up, so there are gonna be many people playing pubs. To summarize this: - You can still have fun in pubs - People actually play the objective now - Queue times are relatively short AND will be fixed even more - TF2 is not dead, in fact, even more alive than ever  Edit2: Really enjoyed Smissmas this year as well. Good to see Valve is trying to put out as much content as they can while still working on the Pyro Update.  Thanks 4 readin"
"If someone has under 100 hours in a game I don't really feel that they have the right to judge it, especially when looking the ability of teamfortess 2 to offer so many different game types.  I have played and experienced most of what is available in the game thus far, and I am going to relay to any new user what to expect from this product.   Casual play:  The casual system works smoothly for every user and you will enjoy some of the best class-based, first-person-shooter, gameplay that there is on the market.  The only issue is that your rank (that little metal you can click on in the top left corner) means nothing for the most part. You will be paired with people of all ranks no matter what rank you are (which doesn't bother me because most people with a high rank aren't actually better than you).  If you want to get better at the game or have any questions about the game types or maps, please look on youtube. There are so many videos that can explain the meta better than I can in one review. Just type in your specific class or map that you want to learn about and their should be an answer for you.   Competitive play:  If you want to play competitive tf2 there is a specific way of going about it  DO NOT: use the in-game competitive mode. Unfortunately it is the one thing valve is currently developing and it is not a very good system just yet. (no punishment for abandoning, and the numbers system will ensure you never rank up).  DO: use the UGC (user generated competition) system or the ESEA system for finding, matching, and competing in a very well organized and incredibly addictive, competitive environment. (make sure you have over 1000 hours logged before attempting competitive, it really does make the difference).  (here is a link to the UGC and ESEA websites:  http://playcomp.tf/  )   Mann Vs Machine:  Though there aren't as many people who play this game mode any more (mostly because of a lack of updates) this mode is one of the most fun wave survival games I have played. In addition, you can get some really great loot for completing your tours (Austrailum weapons and professional killstreak kits and the like).   If you want to try your hand at Mann Vs Machine (MvM) please educate yourself first with youtube videos on what weapons and classes you need to play as. (Or your team will kick you and I wouldn't blame them. There is a right way to beat MvM and no one has the patients for a special snowflake that wants to try something new).  You may be discriminated against if you haven't completed many tours, but if you do as you are instructed from your superiors (being the people with at least 10 more tours than you) then you should be fine.   Mann Power:  This mode should never be taken too seriously, it is mainly something to play when you just want to have some fun. The powers are hilariously fun and the grapple hook offers a great time just for messing around with. This mode is for those that don't want to take anything seriously, have fun here.   PASS:  The same game as the regular casual except there is a ball you can pass between players, (the obvious goal is to throw it into the enemy team's goal). This game mode is also for those that are laid back, the maps are fun to explore and I can honestly say that running around with the JACK (the ball) with a speed buff is a stupidly fun time. Same as above, this is for you to just chill and maybe score some goals in.   Community Servers:  These are the hardest to describe as every server can be extremely different from the other. From custom game modes, to custom maps, and weapon abilities, you never really know what you are going to get in each of the servers. Also, this is where you make friends, because many of the people that you meet on community servers will often return to them and you will begin to see them more and more. In addition community servers are places where you can trade, chill, be a friendly (basically being the dude who doesn't kill anyone for some inexplicable reason) or the tryhard (which might get you kicked if you attack friendlies too often).   A side note for being a tryhard: If you want to kill everyone, that's totally cool and mute anyone who says otherwise because it is your right in playing this game. But understand you may be focused by the entire server if there are a lot of people who want to be friendly. No it's not fair that it's a 6v1, but remember that they weren't the ones that wanted to fight in the first place so kill carefully.  But please do try to find the community server for you, because I am a firm believer that with enough searching, anyone can find their own special niche community to latch on to and grow from (even if you are the band of roleplaying, ♥♥♥-nuggets that spammed my profile with furry garbage **** which has been found and deleted ****).   Creating a server:  If you have an opportunity to LAN with other people,  Do it.   Final thoughts:  This game offers more content and entertainment than most games that you actually have to pay money for and is defiantly worth your time if you enjoy class based first person shooters. Despite that some of the updates are under-whelming, that doesn't take away from this being an epic game to invest your hours into. Cheers."

"The gameplay:  It's a team-based game that uses different classes, and of course, like every FPS valve game, you have no iron sights (but can scope in with a sniper rifle). However, there are quite a few fun weapons and tactics you can use on this game, and every class is perfectly balanced. Neither class that you choose is nerfed or OP, so you can dominate the game with any of them. There's always going to be the pros who have 1000+ hours on this game that will destroy you with no effort, but no matter what happens, you will most likely have fun playing this even if you are losing.  The community:  Considering that I have only 100 hours on this, there's not much I can say about the community in detail. According to others, it's filled with strange, annoying people from different fandoms like MLP and Undertale. I haven't witnessed any yet (probably because I don't visit many community servers except the Skial ones), but I'm sure they're out there somewhere.   However, from what I have seen, I can tell you that for the most part, the people here do tend to argue regularly like any other FPS community, but most people I have played with aren't the tempermental tryhards who get really emotional about winning. The general community is a balanced mix of polite players who help you, people who constantly use scripts to spam the chat, trolls, and a few hackers (keep in mind that compared to the silver ranks in CSGO, the hackers are very rare here, so don't worry about them too much). There's also a few mic spammers too.   If there is one thing that does get a few people fired up (not everyone, but a few) on this game, it's the divide between F2P and P2P players. Basically, the F2P players are seen as stupid, ignorant, and disrespectul players who are terrible at the game by the P2Ps. Now, while I'm not sure about what the negative thoughts are about the P2P players, I would assume that they are stereotyped as materialistic morons who obsess over cosmetics (in other words, they spend lots of real money to buy fancy looking pixels that don't exist in the real world), but I could be wrong.   So yeah, that's the community for you from what I have experienced.  What I love about this game:  -It's not like your typical run of the mill FPS shooter where the only type of character you play as is some random guy running around with a gun. You actually have to think here. You can use rocket launchers. You can use grenade launchers. The different classes make this game far more enjoyable than just playing a generic shooter.   What I don't like:  -From what I've seen, the in-game market is a scam. For example, I was bought three booster packs for three classes. These packs I bought contain all of the weapons and equipment for your class, and let me tell you something; it is a huge ripoff. First of all, the items that you use in these packs, specifically the primaries, are mostly useless compared to the stock primary. Second of all, these items you buy can be easily earned in-game for free. Third, once you have the exact same items obtained by playing the game for free, you will realise that your booster packs are wasting space. Unfortunately, you cannot use them in crafting. Very classy, Valve...   With all that being said, I'd say this game is very fun and enjoyable, especially once you get the hang of playing a class. TF2 is definitely a blast."

(here is a link to the UGC and ESEA websites:  http://playcomp.tf/  )   Mann Vs Machine:  Though there aren't as many people who play this game mode any more (mostly because of a lack of updates) this mode is one of the most fun wave survival games I have played. In addition, you can get some really great loot for completing your tours (Austrailum weapons and professional killstreak kits and the like).   If you want to try your hand at Mann Vs Machine (MvM) please educate yourself first with youtube videos on what weapons and classes you need to play as. (Or your team will kick you and I wouldn't blame them. There is a right way to beat MvM and no one has the patients for a special snowflake that wants to try something new).  You may be discriminated against if you haven't completed many tours, but if you do as you are instructed from your superiors (being the people with at least 10 more tours than you) then you should be fine.   Mann Power:  This mode should never be taken too seriously, it is mainly something to play when you just want to have some fun. The powers are hilariously fun and the grapple hook offers a great time just for messing around with. This mode is for those that don't want to take anything seriously, have fun here.   PASS:  The same game as the regular casual except there is a ball you can pass between players, (the obvious goal is to throw it into the enemy team's goal). This game mode is also for those that are laid back, the maps are fun to explore and I can honestly say that running around with the JACK (the ball) with a speed buff is a stupidly fun time. Same as above, this is for you to just chill and maybe score some goals in.   Community Servers:  These are the hardest to describe as every server can be extremely different from the other. From custom game modes, to custom maps, and weapon abilities, you never really know what you are going to get in each of the servers. Also, this is where you make friends, because many of the people that you meet on community servers will often return to them and you will begin to see them more and more. In addition community servers are places where you can trade, chill, be a friendly (basically being the dude who doesn't kill anyone for some inexplicable reason) or the tryhard (which might get you kicked if you attack friendlies too often).   A side note for being a tryhard: If you want to kill everyone, that's totally cool and mute anyone who says otherwise because it is your right in playing this game. But understand you may be focused by the entire server if there are a lot of people who want to be friendly. No it's not fair that it's a 6v1, but remember that they weren't the ones that wanted to fight in the first place so kill carefully.  But please do try to find the community server for you, because I am a firm believer that with enough searching, anyone can find their own special niche community to latch on to and grow from (even if you are the band of roleplaying, ♥♥♥-nuggets that spammed my profile with furry garbage **** which has been found and deleted ****).   Creating a server:  If you have an opportunity to LAN with other people,  Do it.   Final thoughts:  This game offers more content and entertainment than most games that you actually have to pay money for and is defiantly worth your time if you enjoy class based first person shooters. Despite that some of the updates are under-whelming, that doesn't take away from this being an epic game to invest your hours into. Cheers."
"One of the best games ever! 10/10 :D  Edit: I really don't get why people are freaking out so much over the new update. Competetive is something we have all been waiting for and imo it's awesome. 'B-b- but it takes 20 minutes to get into a game!' No. It doesn't. Competetive usually takes 2 minutes for me. Think about other games. That's literally the same as in LoL for example. ALso the new casual mode. 'Oh my god they REMOVED pubs?? I'm never playing this again valve' Just stop. I have played over 20 casual matches so far and i see little to no difference from the old pubs. There are still spycrabs, hoovies and other idiots that don't play the objective. What I like about the leveling system in casual is that you cannot lose exp (but i think you gain less if you lose). THIS is very good, cause it encourages players to ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME. Everyone wants to level up, so there are gonna be many people playing pubs. To summarize this: - You can still have fun in pubs - People actually play the objective now - Queue times are relatively short AND will be fixed even more - TF2 is not dead, in fact, even more alive than ever  Edit2: Really enjoyed Smissmas this year as well. Good to see Valve is trying to put out as much content as they can while still working on the Pyro Update.  Thanks 4 readin"

"In my opinion, Team Fortress 2 is the funniest FPS game I have ever played, in fact, it is the best game i ever played in first person altogether. I highly recommend it to everybody, Team Fortress 2 is a great game with all its hats, updates and unlockable weapons. I just hope it stays Team Fortress 2 and never changes to Team Fortress 3, Gabe, just leave it alone, its a great game, dont change it."
Worth every penny... Oh wait...
"What could I say about Team Fortress that hasn't been said before? It's simply a great game. Not only is it free to play, but it offers unique and fun gameplay, characters, and innovations that many games today lack."
IT'S JUST NOT FUN ANYMORE.  Pros: I honestly can't think of any after the MyM update.  Cons: Hackers everywhere. Can take up to 4 minutes to join a game. Unbalanced weapons *cough*phlog*cough*  Valve really ruined this game for me.
"Wait time has become too long was sat wait for 15min at the lest, used to be able to join a game as soon as i started 2ft up."

Very addictive and fun.
"First it was guns. Then it was hats. Now it's dead.  Well okay, not strictly dead - the playerbase is still relatively strong - but after more than 8 years Valve just doesn't know what to do with its game anymore, and it's hemorrhaging experienced players. It's increasingly an empty shell, in other words. The Meet Your Match update was the final straw: it introduced matchmaking, but only after more than a year of development  and  the release of Overwatch, the latest hugely popular cartoony multiplayer team FPS and a game with great matchmaking.  TF2's matchmaking on the other hand came at the direct cost of Quickplay and the repurposing of Valve-hosted servers, which were the easiest and quickest way to get a guaranteed decent vanilla game anywhere in the world. It's also not very good.  Matchmaking in either Casual or Competitive is slow to find you a game that often ends too fast in a curbstomp win by one of the teams, and there's no autobalance or team switching allowed. Competitive copies the 6v6 format that is popular in the game's competitive scene, but then fails to enforce the class limits and weapon bans that made 6v6 what it was. Meanwhile, Casual matchmaking is too structured to replace the drop-in drop-out play you had with the server browser, or the ease of Quickplay. While there are a couple of decent vanilla servers to be found - not to mention plenty of modded servers - in the server browser, there is essentially no quick go-to place for vanilla games anymore.   The update also 'fixed' a 'bug' with the Righteous Bison secondary weapon that was actually one of its key features when the weapon was originally released.  It was originally meant to penetrate and damage enemies multiple times  [i.redditmedia.com] , which punished them for running away since it would hurt them even more. It no longer does this.  Also of note is that all of the Medic's mediguns now allow the Medic to match the speed of their healing targets, something that devalues the Quick-Fix medigun even more since that was once a property exclusive to it. These changes, along with the other constant major balance changes, indicate a team that doesn't really know their own game, or at least the grounding for its historical decisions. Change is one thing, but  this  is another.   My theory for why these things have happened is that developer turnover within Valve over the years has resulted in a team that's almost completely comprised of new blood as opposed to the original developers, and their efforts to keep Team Fortress going have resulted in bloat and mismanagement. I know they try; I really do think they honestly try to do the best that they can do. They're not stupid. At this point though I don't know if they'll ever get the game back on track without a complete reassessment of priorities, or a new team with a unified focus, or a whole new game. None of these are likely to happen.  TF2's updates have been in a slow decline for a while now. There's been hundreds upon hundreds of new cosmetics, new weapons, new gamemodes, and yet not much substance. As good as the community contributions have been, there is just  too much  now. The constant release of Workshop maps into the game itself (even if some of them are very good) and now the Heavy vs. Pyro update seem more and more like the sputtering of a game that more experienced devs would have learned to leave well enough alone by now. An end-of-life phase. TF2's content-first, quantity-over-quality mindset is dragging it deeper and deeper into its own muck, sad to say.  The base game itself remains good, if you ignore some of the more annoying/unbalanced weapons. I would recommend arranging pick-up games with friends for the foreseeable future if you want to play, though. If there were a mixed rating here, I would now apply it to my most-played game of all time without a second thought."

TF2 Stole my life and emptied my bank account... 10/10
"TF2 is probably the best choice for someone who likes playing games and not spending any money on it at all, because you can just find items by playing the game. Many maps and cool features make this game very fun and it hardly ever gets boring. Definitely recommend"
"Greatest FPS of all time. And with constant free content updates from Valve, it gets better all the time."
Best Military SWAG Simulator 2xxx   10/10

Best of money losing simulator
I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game.
"Ok, kids. Long story short. RIP Team Fortress 2, 2008-2016. Greatest multiplayer game i ever played. Now the game is pretty much screwed, new update completely overhauled quickplay mechanic that brought me deeper into the game. Before that it was awesome, i played with pretty much same people every night on my favorite maps and it was really great. Now the game is so broken there is no point in discussing it. IDK what made the developers suddenly overhaul the balance in this game and remove the quickplay mechanic."
It's Awesome!
"Review as of the Meet your Match update. TF2 team. Why? The casual play mode wasn't wantet, nor needed. Could of been an option for people who wanted to get onto Comp but didn't feel experienced enough for the whole thing, but now it is THE TF2 experience. And that's not good. Even if the long wait times were to be over once the hype dies down (Seriously, 1 hour? For a single match?) the wait times for casual mode will be as bad or even worse than the MVM ones, while with the old system, I could simply choose my gamemode (AND map), hop onto whatever server that seemed fine, and just play. No need to leave once the match is over, either, just to hop BACK onto the matchmaking and wait AGAIN for another match with new players. I could just sit in ctf_turbine to my heart's content without a worry in the world. Speaking of worries. Ranks in casual mode. What if I were to tell you that, because of being friendly (something that the team ITSELF encouraged with the Bread update with group and partner taunts between teams) you'll be matched with gibuses and people new to the game. Casual mode gives too much of a focus on the objective (yes, in pubs, it SHOULD be a thing), which means you must either 'play the game' or GTFO. 'Yeah, but, uh, can't you join a community server?' Last year or so, the team added an option to look for community servers in quickplay. Now this option is gone; you'll have to painstakingly cherry pick a server from the server list. The game would of been fine if it just kept the old quickplay, pub system. For the competitive players, it is great and an easy way to hop into 6v6. For the average player? Wait long times for a single match? Don't even bother."
"WELP VALVE RUINED IT NOW. BECAUSE OF THIS CANCEROUS NEW 'UPDATE' ITS LAGGY, NERFED EVERYTHING, THE ROCKET JUMPER LOOKS LIKE A BUTTPLUG, AND GETTING INTO A GAME TAKES FOREVER. I WOULDENT WASTE MY TIME ON THIS. i use to be a huge fan of this game. THANKS ALOT VALE WE ALL WANtED THIS!."
"Valve, everything was fine until THE STUPID MEET YOUR MATCH UPDATE CAME OUT. It has screwed my macbook up, is making TF2 unrunnable, unplayble, and unbearble. Don't make me wait 10 mins to find a server that is in Hong Kong or something. Remove the new menu things, the old ones were better. I fixed the crashing problem. NOW NEW PROBLEM. 'Run out of Apllication Memory'. i have 4GB ram, my old laptop handled TF2 find and that was 3GB ram.  Let TF2 be what it was before."
nice game with nice graphics and and you will never get bored with all of this new weapon and maps and game modes and it has 9 classes each class has his own ability to do his job
Most likely the game you'll always wanna play.
 Because of the new update people are keeping hackers on their team instead of kicking them! Screenshots below!
The amount of hours I have spent playing this game says it all.  My favourite game of all time.
"First, check the achievements for pyro. Check which one gives you the backburner, then start up the game and farm it together; congratulations! Now you can equip your weapon sent to you by the achievement gods and grab a small rock, place it on your W key to win! Don't forget to hang your massive scrotum over your microsoft mouse and flail it around madly while screaming in mumble until desired success is achieved.  Yes I used to main pyro.  It was a necessity."
Still good after years even if Valve doesn't care anymore about it.
"After 1,630 hours of 'wasting' my time playing this game I can now safely say that this game is going downhill with all this other stuff Valve squished in. Besides all that, this game is probably not the worst in my library. That doesn't mean it's the best tho. Mostly everything about this game is fun, besides the tryhards and 'cancerous' people on server, and provides a variety of cool mechanics that not a lot of FPS' have. Fun game and cool mechanics + tryhards who are probably just kids hitting puberty at the moment. Nuff said."
If I could live inside this game... and make a pyro family. I SO ♥♥♥♥ING WOULD. Anyway if you don't like TF2 I dont like you :)
Really awesome game
"I cannot believe I have decided to finally come back and review my old favourite game. Team Fortress 2.  This was not only my favourite game for 3 years, it was the reason I got Steam, the first game I played on Steam, and it was the game that introduced me to the First Person Shooter genre that I grew to love with a passion. I don't think that love would have ever flourished were it not for the fun, whacky, cartoony, fast-paced action that TF2 provided for me. The characters, the art, the freaking music all helped to make TF2 an instant favourite. I had thousands of hours playing this game, and some of my fondest memories in this game are among my fondest memories of any game ever, from sentry nesting while taunting like a lazy jerk, to long chases down hallways as the Pyro, to MvM standoffs against insurmountable odds, that we still conquered and earned the rewards for. I had spent perhaps hundreds of pounds (yep, i'm british) buying cool ♥♥♥♥ on this game, determined to support the shooter that captured my imagination and humor, and look damn good while doing it. This game is very close to my heart. But I never wrote a review on TF2. This is why, after, hell, 4 years of absence, it suprises me that I find myself coming back to review this game. Only one thing suprises me more.  It's a negative review.  Valve has made some ♥♥♥♥ ups in the past. We all know this. In TF2, the messed up End Of The Line update that left everyone feeling betrayed and underwhelmed. In their other projects, like CS:GO, we had the R8 Revolver. Yeah, remember that piece of crap, the one that would give your teammates a hemorraghe as they watched you get cross-map sniped by the jerk that had lost all his money but who still had the power to one shot you? In both of these occasions Valve was made to look like idiots who had lost touch with their community. However, once the anger had died down (and the ban hammer was dropped with the force of a thousand suns), I think we could all agree to agree that Valve clearly did still have some clear connection with their gamers, as opposed to just being a game developer. Even with the perpetual cocktease of Half Life 3 hanging in the horizon, Valve stood strong against their own bad decision making.  But never, in all of their developmental history, has anything as bad as the recent pile of faecal matter called the Meet Your Match update been considered possible. I mean come on. How can you ♥♥♥♥ up TF2? It was well balanced (after much trial and error), it was receiving an unprecedented ammount of community feedback every day for Valve to go off of, and no matter how bad competetive mode was likely to be on release, nothing could ruin the crucial, fundamental TF2 exprerience of hopping on a server and blowing people up with crockets and headshots and backstabs and scatterguns. It was too simple to possibly ruin, now that Valve understood what casual TF2 was, and had perfected it.  Nah, they ♥♥♥♥ed it up. 30 minute queue times, a lack of ability to choose your map, a lack of ability to (initially) choose your game mode, a lack of ability to LEAVE THE GAME without recieving a penalty, preventing people from moving as they please around servers, permanent ranks and stattracking that shows off your wins and losses to EVERYONE, PERMANENTLY, with NO WAY TO TURN THEM OFF, IN CASUALS, and no more Valve servers that ran their old, perfect, fundamental formula. Nothing about this is okay.  I have not seen someone so out of touch with their people since David Cameron. Absolutely no-one wanted casual TF2 to go. We wanted ranked (for some reason), don't get me wrong, it obviously always enriches a game to have tryharding rank-junkies invade a game about robots, guns, hats and gibs filled with 11 year olds, but not even the most tryharding scumbagging, DoX'ing prats wanted ranked's intenst formula to REPLACE casuals. The only way you can join a game without suffering the TORMENT above is to visit a community server (read: spam, admin abuse, trading, messed up rules, advertisements), which is often just as bad if not worse. But hey, it's about the only way to get into a game without spending an eternity, so what other options do you have? That's right, none.  Overwatch's arrival hit Valve like a freight truck. 13 Million players in a few weeks is a lot to compete with. It's organised, ability based style threatened TF2's popularity; they were both class based FPS' with an emphasis on teamwork, countering and fast-paced objective action. The differences between them, however, were obvious to everyone. From the item system, to the varying game modes, the two were clearly distinct and both would remain popular. Everyone saw that, even though many jokes were made about it. Everyone apart from Valve that is, and their attempt to turn TF2 into a similarly strict, co-ordinated game like Overwatch killed everything unique about TF2 that would have kept it strong. Valve's complete lack of communication and understanding has never been more clear, and I feel personally betrayed at their lack of reasoning, preparation, and most of all their lack of faith in their community to be able to play two games at once.  TF2 is fun. It is not an enriching competetive experience, it is a goofy, enjoyable casual game with varying play-styles and diversity unburdened by permanent player-stats and performance pressure. It was never designed with those disgusting LCS tournaments in mind. And if Valve continue trying to fit a square peg in a round hole, the peg is going to break in half."
"Best hat simulator in the business. Oh and there's mini games with co op, ctf,payload,payload race,attack and defend,control point with 9 different classes with a varied amount of weapons"
"Playing since 2008 and still my favorite go to shoot-em-up. I've made real life friends, and had more laughs than I can count. I still play rather vanilla, but enjoy that the community can and has played such a big part in developing items and creating a wild economy within the game."
"so my friend and i both got tf2 back when it was in the orange box and i played that for about 2 years. then my pc died and i didnt play it for 6 years then got a new pc and started playing it again it was still good. then i stoped playing it for about an other year, came back to it about 4 months ago game was still good. then the update came out 7/7/16 and the game is now a copy of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ csgo dont get this once great game its now really bad. if they change it back to the way it was i would tell people to get it but now no"
"I..... I cant begin to describe how i feel. what i feel is that..... Tf2 is dying. Its hard to admit. I still love it, but the telltale signs are everywhere. Youtubers leaving, and hell. Shibby is basically a freaking battlefield 4 youtuber now! Like, seriously! What did we do to force him to play the generic military shooter that has been rehashed? Tf2 was great. It still is. Its, one of the most unique and innovative games, and well, its dying. Nothing lasts forever. Tf2 has been around for 19 -ish years and theres only a certain point to something. You start with a sketch. You expand on it, draw lines all over the paper, fill in the gaps. But eventually...... Your run out of space.. I hate to see a wonderful game die. But more and more actual servers empty, and more and more people go to trade, idle and VSH servers, the game slowly kills itself. Is tf2 still the 3rd most played game? Hell yeah! But so many of those people are congaing, or bartering over unusuals, and not playing the game. Is it the communities fault? No. A poor reflection of valves contribution and what just soldified the joke that 'Valve used to make games, now they make money' Is the end of the line update, a poor excuse that could have introduced something that hasnt been seen in so long- a FINISHED map. Not ♥♥♥♥ing operation hole bound beta, or tile texture RD, but a real, somewhat new gamemode. But valve took it out because it was 'Too confusing' They dont add weapons, only cosmetics and a ♥♥♥♥ing cheap attempt to suck up money through bonus ducks. I would hate to see tf2 die, because so many people are invested. If tf2 dies, so does the market. the 10,000 dollar spender who bought the burning KE. Smissmass was okay. New weapons. Yay. But once again valve seems to be trying to please us with half finished ideas with mannpower. Theyve brought too much beta, and we the people would much rather see a finished and drawn out map rather than a ♥♥♥♥ overpowered attempt at pleasing the people. I dont hate tf2. I hate whatever the cause may be for this wonderful deviation from the rehashed ♥♥♥♥ing military shooters like hardline and advanced warfare. Just please, valve, as great as community effort might be, it seems like your not trying. Please make it like the good ol days where You'd introduce a polished custom map that is valve standards every update. We have enough hats and festives. we need weapons, and maps, and gamemodes, and anything but this ♥♥♥♥. Just please. Ive gone through 2 game deaths in my gamer career. They were fun on the last days, moderators giving out planned items, it was amazing. but then they ended. And although you think youll be fine, you sometimes wake up and go to your computer, and open up steam only to remember that your favorite game is gone.  Please, dont leave the ones who love this in the dust. Just focus on this game and give it some love"
"I would have recommended this game, before the absolute colossal ♥♥♥♥ that the 'meet your match' update was, which made some fair weapon balances, brought PASS time out of beta, bought into the game a competitive matchmaking system. All this is good, but removing the casual pub servers has destroyed this game. I will not touch this game until this is fixed. I had already left this game once as i was getting into CS:GO but now this move may be permanent if this ♥♥♥♥ isnt sorted out. Its not a fun game when pushed into playing it competitively all the time. Uninstalled."
Very fun for Hours/days/weeks/months/years/lifetimes!
"Valve why you change the best part of TF2 game? why you dont put for competitive a system like mann co vs robot?  I played this game since many years and this update kill the casual playing.  With this new system you can't join a friend in other server easily like the old system.   I don't want force to play like competitive game with a crap level system like overwatch  If you want to make a competitive system, you can put a system like Mann co vs Robot, bring back the old quickplay and a lvl system for people who want to make competitive servor. Players needs to have the choice !!!!!   I want to play to my old sweety friend TF2 game, when i played one map quickly before dinner, before job interview or in another situations. I don't want to play with a stress of perfomance, i want to spend a good time with this game after a stressfull day at work.  Bring back the old quickplay !!!!! Bring back our game !!!!"
I have only played it a little. It seems kinda fun.
"Pray for not get a ♥♥♥♥♥ crit in your face in any volvo pub.  Dont try to play comp in this game, if u are leaving in Syberia. Dont live in Syberia. And u will be fine. Graphic optimization is bad, Im playing Minecraft with rocketlaunchers and miniguns. 10 dropped ubers of 10."
If you like hats you will like this.
"Team Fortress 2 is the biggest cluster ♥♥♥♥ with strategy I have ever played, but I love the trading system. In this game, you choose teams, and a class with a basic set of tools to kill your enemies, along with teammates, every character has his own backstory, and truths: Valve really ,really thoguht this through."
"Been playing this since 2011 on friends/my pc.  2008 on lan houses :3   There is no words to describe this game of awesomeness, try new loadouts, have fun with hilarious scenes and situations, well, download and play it. Remember to always be creative, thousands of possibilities."
This game are the best from my games.
"I really  liked  this game, until the TF:GO update. The ecosystem was stable; where the competitive players went with CS:GO and the casuals went to TF2. Valve must have found that CS:GO makes them more money than TF2, so the decided to make a matchmaking system much like it.  Unfortunately, they took casual mode down with it. When you join a match, you take penalties for leaving the game halfway through, and they  removed autobalance entirely . The gameplay is awesome but they really took the game down a notch with this update."
"Probably one of the best games I have seen in my life. Team Fortress 2 combines the teamwork and the individual skill perfectly, making you feel useful even if the only thing you have done in the match is killing a random person.  Nine means nine ways of playing, which actually translates in nine different games. At least at first. As soon as you start unlocking weapons, you will discover that you can play with a class in a whole different way, refreshing your interest for the game.  If that weren't enough to keep you playing this game forever, Valve releases updates every few months, weeks, or even days, with tons of fixes and, more importantly, additions to the game, making you want to play more and more.  But that is not the best part. Everything important in this game is 100% free. Unlockable weapons, which are the best part of the game, will drop randomly as you keep playing, making paying users not better than free to play users. No pay2win in this ♥♥♥♥."
"Hat simulator.   BTW, Auto balance kinda ruins the 'team' part. But you can always join a servver with autobalance disabled."
"This is supposed to be a review for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Dedicated Server.  Apparently that's not a game. I should have known.  Not only can I not play the dedicated server like it is a game, I can't review it like one either.  Let me save you some time. Do not try to play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Dedicated Server! It is not a game!  If you want a comparable non-game, open the command prompt. That will save you so much downloading. It's like you have to download all the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive content, but only get to access it through command prompt. Why? Sure sure, other people can play the game on your computer because you're running a 'Server' but all I get is words in a black box. Who needs that? Certainly not me!  Getting shot repeatedly in Team Fortress 2 is much better. I would encourage you to play Team Fortress 2 over something like Command Prompt Simulator for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive."
*Plays Game for 500 hours*  *Gets Bored*  *Finds a hat*  *1000 more hours*  *get into trading*  *another 1000 hours*  gud game 10/1
"This game is very interactive. It never stops to amaze me how people get dragged in to it as much as possible. Trying to get dominations, revenge, killstreaks, and much more are all part of improving your skill. The hats and miscs keep you coming for more. The wild combination of tactics and skills never stops. Go get it, it's awesome! :)"
"Basically a good first-time-game, if you want to play shooting games.  Graphics are unique when you compare it to other team vs team games.  A big shop with a lot of clothing and free weapons makes the game more interesting, in a way that the users can get creative and style their own characters.   Nine classes, makes the game more challenging and less boring, as you can just switch class when you feel like it. The videos about the characters and their histories are absolutely terrific, and the medic is something you don't see in every game, as you heal with a medic-gun and shoots with this incredible 'syringe shooting gun', where in other games it's often a character with a medic-back and often with normal (often normal) guns or in use of some type of magic.   Also is the game always active with players and new products in store. In all is the game catchy and available for everyone. 5/5"
I can hit things with a mailbox. 11/10
Click on 'Casual Play'.  Searching... Searching... Searching...  (5 million years later)  Searching... Searching... Searching...  Would click on 'Casual Play' mode again to search my life away...
Total waste of time.  Lots of hats.  Lots of fun.
With every casual match now full of hackers/idlers and griefers and no way of kicking them. i wouldnt reccommend this until its fixed
I love this game more then any other game on my steam list
"I love this game. 5/5, 10/10, 100/100. Best fps action to date, and a KILLER hat simulator."
"I would have probably positively reviewed this game 1 month ago but Vavle literally messed up the game with the new Meet your Match uptade. Say goodbye to the good old Quickplay button. feelsbadman. haven't played the game that much, but by this time I had good times playing with my friends. TF2 used to be fun, now it's competitive. You may say that you can always join a server using the community server but seriously, is there something less well designed than that option ? It's too late, the game is dead, you had to come earlier. Rip off."
  PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE TAKING IN ALL OF THE OTHER NEGATIVE REVIEWS
Nice game looking nice and it is awesome!  You can buy something in mann co. store and get premium for trading and getting awesome items!  And you find items anyways!  Nice F2P and P2P game!
"spent so much time and money in to this game. and lord, its worth getting and buying(if first time) something from the mann co. store(i suggest a mann co. key, doesnt matter what kind). i still remember my first time with tf2. i didnt understand it much about it. but now, its my most played steam game. 100000000000000000000000000/10 for team fortess 2!"
Still great to play after nearly 1700 hours :D
"Good job, Volvo. You ruined one of the most casual games on the internet.  As of 7/8/2016, all 'Casual' matches are ranked with penalties for leaving. It takes absolute ages to join, just so one team can get roflstomped by some group of tryhards with 5 heavies, 3 medics, and a stickyspam demo who can't stop spamming Lenny binds. The game now forces you to use the basic hud, which while not entirely bad, is terrible for those of us who like a more clean or useful one.  Not only this, but Competitive, after being hyped up for about a year, costs $20 to access. As of now it's $10 due to a sale, but if you don't belive me check the store page.  This game has gone from an extremely fun and amazing experience to feeling like absolute trash. The only alternative to these servers is Community servers, which have dozens of stupid plugins or donor perks. Anyone who says to stop complaining and use them clearly hasn't been on them much.  Overall, this game could certainly be salvaged if Valve reversed the update, apologized to the community, and did something to make up for it. It's extremely saddening to no longer have the old TF2 I fell in love with, but now it's like this mutating Lovecraftian monstrosity that's trying so hard to be better, but making everything about itself worse.  3/10. Fix your game, Valve."
"The new update broke TF2. Thats all I can say. You killed it valve, good job."
"I spent alot of time on this game. I enjoyed it alot, made many friends form it. The game itself was really great and has a fantastic community. It's just a casual, loose and fun shooter that I screwed around in for many hours with or without friends. But ever since this new update, where they removed the quickplay function, this can no longer be done. Everything has a serious competitive feel to it. Heck, you even get penalised for leaving a match! I think this is outragous to have such a sudden and drastic change to this game. I was never into the competitive scene, otherwise i might aswell just play csgo! Please bring the properly casual quickplay feature back. many people would agree with me that pubs are an essential part of tf2. Please Valve, don't ruin tf2."
best hat simulator ever!
Met my boyfriend and became obsessed with getting an 80 dollar particle effect. 10/10 would experience again.
Used to love this game but with the new casual matchmaking update ♥♥♥♥ed this game it is totally ruined. It will soon die after some weeks.
It's still ♥♥♥♥ing better than CS:GO.
There's a reason why this game has better reviews and metric gamer ratings than 99.99% of your other FPS.   I forgot what the reason was.......
"Best game i ever played in my  entire life..  Why people think this game is dead? Overwatch is  not better  than this game.. I have more than  2500+ hour  but not on this acc  AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT OVERWATCH IS A GARBAGE!!    I better love this game than overwatch..   i never played Overwatch but i saw videos    Love everything  this game contains. Why people hate the  'Meat Your Match'  update? I think it's still playable and Valve doing everything for this game. Yes the game was much much more better in the good ol' times.... but i still love this game   I know we had to wait a really really long time for a server , but  Valve fixed it so we dont have to wait that much  so  let Valve do his job and wait for updates/fixes    Oh and Valve. NEVER. NEVER. stop. with. Team Fortress 2 "
"This is the second game I ever played in steam in 2010, This game supports Items and Competitive Ranked Matches, This game is estonishing and incredibly made, Even though I disagree on some stuff that the TF2 Development implemented in to the game, this game and my review will be Positive"
"Team Fortress 2 is a fun, quite addicting FPS multiplayer game. You can play as 9 different classes, including Demoman, Medic, Heavy, Soldier, Pyro, Engineer, Spy, Sniper, and my favorite, Scout. Each class has their different strengths and weaknesses, and their colorful personalities will keep you laughing while you play. With its fun characters, cool unlockable items, detailed maps, and the fact that its FREE, I would definitely give it a 10/10."
I've lost most of my childhood to this game and it was worth every second.
Showed me what real squeaker tears tasted like. 5 stars.
"Valve is pretty much too lazy to make updates anymore. The last halloween was also a disappointment, used the community to make their maps."
There's a reason why this game has better reviews and metric gamer ratings than 99.99% of your other FPS.   I forgot what the reason was.......
I love this game very addicting and fun!
"'Team Fortress 2 is a widely acclaimed online hat simulator and trading forum offering an unprecedented amount of headwear unlike any other multiplayer game. Choose from one of nine playable characters as you buy, sell, swap and craft trendy headwear running vaguely within the character's art direction. Once you are sporting your chosen attire, join up to fifteen other players on the same team and face-off against another fifteen players on the other team in the ultimate battle of fashion.  Make no mistake, Team Fortress 2 has several layers of strategy that players must learn in order to defeat their enemies. Think your Soldier's Stash impresses the enemy? Think again! The Stash is so 2009, what you need is a Killer's Kabuto with red flames. But before you bask in the glow of your supposed invulnerability, you must avoid scammers and players demanding your hat in exchange for promotional items with arbitrary values.  There's also a hidden first person shooter mini-game.'  pH., Tim. (2012)"
"Forget about what I did to the preview before.  How 2 win TF2：Wear a Gibus  BTW: Don't play overwatch, it's TF2 for weebs"
" Play the game for yourself, not for the developers.  That's how you have fun. You don't think about the future of the game, whether it'll be dead or still alive. You play it in the present. You just came home from a horrible day and need to unwind. You had a good day and you wanna capitalize on it.  Don't play the game for the community, or the hats, or the  countless  number of bugs. Play it just to have fun, whatever that may be. Competitive, friendly, 100% crits, whatever it is, just have fun.  The game will take care of the rest. I promise you. "
"Team Fortress 2 is a very hard game for me to look at objectively, as my hours kind of attest to. In the 3000+ hours I've spent with this game running, I've come to know a handful of internationally based friends who I respect and value dearly, made $20,000 at the very least in the trading scene and made a name in (and run afoul) of multiple in-game communities. It's a game that's consistently evolved, from the gameplay centric days of old before hats worth more then a year in College were a common thing, to the particle and taunt based, mish-mash of an experiment that it is now.   I was once a free-to-player. I played it for a good 9 months before deciding to finally try being a premium. That's how it got me. I first bought a unique 'Huntsman' from the in-game store. Then I found a Phlogistinator in a timed drop and going off what the in-game store was selling them for at the time, I tried selling it for $20 on TF2Outpost. Those were simpler times. From there I ended up investing $1000 (real world dollars) into virtual items, and ended up making a veritable goldmine out of the investment, in more ways then one. I could dedicate a long spiel to discussing how the trading community is a meta-game in itself, one where real tangible thousands of dollars can change hands in seconds in the form of a virtual hat or a golden pan, but I really just wanted to make this review to reflect my own experiences with the game. This is a very fun, very addictive game.  It is held aloft after close to ten years since release by a very receptive community who care about the game and keep it going strong. At any given time, there's anywhere from 50,000-70,000 players online, so there's nothing to stop you jumping right into the thick of things with communities with depth and breadth beyond that of any other game I've played. You will be able to find a niche that fits, a casual or modified gamemode that appeals and you will have a hard time leaving. You'll make friends, you'll make enemies (especially if you try to get into trading seriously) and you won't forget the time you spend in this game.  In light of recent divisive updates, there's a lot that can be respected by how the community bands together to tell Valve what they want and actually see a response. It's a testament to the strength of the community and their combined interest in seeing the game live for many years to come. For many people, such as myself, I'm sure they see a lot of experiences in this game have led them to friendships and communities in the real world, and I'll always be thankful for the time I've had in this game in allowing me to have experiences I would not have been able to otherwise.  For the experience, and for knowing that it will continue to be a game that will stand the test of time, I give Team Fortress 2 a very warm recommendation. Just know when to put it down, remember, 3000 hours is close to 5 months playing 24/7."
Only played a few hours. Got a gold Flamethrower. I guess it's a good game
• Absolute multiplayer fun  • graphic  • lot of mods  • lot of servers
"I always thought updates were supposed to   ADD   features, not   REMOVE   them. But i guess i was wrong."
NOT GOOD AT ALL ANYMORE.
"TF2 is really good and fun game, especially when you're high."
This used to be my favorite game until the newest update. Valve ♥♥♥♥ed up and killed fun in tf2 by replacing public servers (pubs) with casual play... Now Valve is trying to 'fix' the casual play even though most of the community wants pubs back.
"I've put more hours into this game than any other game I own. This goes for most people on Steam, and to top it off, this game is completely free. If that doesn't tell you something, I don't know what will. The classes are extremely balanced. Actually everything in this game is balanced. The maps. The classes. The weapons. I've never seen such a balanced game, where everyone has an equal chance.  And that is why so many people play it. Oh, and the hats of course. And the cool holiday events! And...!  Just play it yourself, you won't regret it. :)"
Valve should do a remake of this. Thumbs up if u agree.
"I have played this game since beta in the orange box all those years ago. I loved it because i could just pick up and play. Until the Meet your Match update that is... Don't get me wrong i like the idea of a competitive game mode, but why did they have to remove the old quick play? I have given the game a few hours since the update and here are my thoughts...  Matchmaking takes waaay too long Class balance is anything but community servers are != to the old quick play  There are some good things in this though, the party feature for one, i usually play with friends and that is a feature i wanted for a long time, and i guess the UI updates are nice...  09/07/2016:- Since the patch last night i thought i would update this review.  The casual mode has been changed to bring it closer to what the name suggests. You can now select as little as 1 game type and you no longer get penalised for leaving a game early. This brings it back to what it should have been.  matchmaking still takes meny meny long minutes though so we will just have to wait for that bug to be sorted and spys seem to be able to backstab from any angle..."
best hat simulator ever
"The new update (meet your match) , in my opinion , ruined tf2 I end up waiting 30 mins to get into a match and when you do get into a match its probably real close to being finished Its not a bad game if u have 30 mins of spare time"
"When you play as a giant overweight russian with a rappers medal, a metal jaw, a psychopath hairdo and a gore splattered triad gun who has tornado eyes and call his comrades babies you know you have a jewel of a game."
"They did it, they finally did it. I'm free from this madness. The mode everyone waited for was the EXACT thing to kill off TF2."
"As much as I love this game I can't say its really that good anymore. More people quiting, the new update is '♥♥♥♥' not the worst but bad, and they killed pubs. Now I dont like how valve killed pubs because I missed jumping into a game with friends and doing goofy ♥♥♥♥. I don't want to waste 20 minutes of my life to get into a game. its like a 5.5/10 for me. Trust me it pains me to say that, tf2 is the reason I got onto steam. Goodbye old friend."
"I can't play this game anymore because of the recent update. When hitting the 'Find A Game' tab, nothing happens. Rebooted laptop twice and restarted the game multiple times. Smh."
cool
Amazing 3D Game !!!!!!!  Lots Of Fun   A Lot To Craft   And The Spy &lt;3 &lt;3
Team fortress 2 &gt; Overwatch
guaranteed to eradicate a large chunk of your money and life.
Valve please fix the Merasmission issue...
not anymore any positive point you can make about tf2 today is snuffed out by the sub-par development team
How to play tf2-  Step one:Start qeue Step two: Wait for 2 minutes to an hour Step three:Go into a horribly balanced game Step Four: Lose or steamroll STep five: uninstall  10/10 would uninstall again
gud...but bring bek the old TF2
"Were to start...... As of 7/9/2016 they forced this new matchmaking to compete with overwatch... Complete failure. I've played a total of 5 matchs over 7 hours thats how long I've waited with this new match making. The best part is the system only has you play 2 rounds before FORCING you to disconnect and waiting another 1-3 hours to get in another server. BTW, once you get in-game you cannot invite any friends directly. You have to leave, wait the 10 min pentality before you can lobby up with friends and then wait another 1-3 hours for matchmaking. I'm just saying whatever player base they had left is going to overwatch. If blizzard had any type of smart business leaders they would put overwatch on sale for 10% off and bury TF2 permanently at this point. Just for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles I was able to go make beef nachos and come back before getting into a match. THATS HOW BADLY VALVE ♥♥♥♥ED THIS GAME."
"  Goodbye, Team fortress 2"
pretty good
The new update ruins this game.
After the new update=not so good of a game
By far the best FPS on PC  Its free I've dedicated a lot of my time and money into this game!  The community is fun and nice Gameplay is super fast pace!  If I was at the bar and someone asked me something about tf2 I wouldnt shut up about it all night!  GET THIS GAME ADD FRIENDS ITS CALLED TEAM FORTRESS for a reason!
"i recommend this game lots of fun get to play with ur friends,trade and fun maps"
"Let's start with the fact, that I have never write any review, so don't be too harash with mine, please.  Team Fortress 2. What can be said about this game? Some people might just look at it and say: 'Regular FPS. You play with maybe even 100+ people a day, and shoot to win.' Or is it?  What I like mostly about TF2, is the fact that everything there is build on the TEAMWORK. After all, this is called 'TEAM Fortress 2', not 'Deathmatch Fortress 2'. Playing as a lone wolf will lead you to no where, and even eventually make you rage quit from playing this game. For good.  It's not about your high score, or how many kills you get at the end of the round. (altough it still motivate you to fight more and shows that you are the experienced player to others) It's all about doing the objective together with your team, to win the game. And every new game there is completely different than previous one, so working together as a team is really important with every challenge that comes with every new game mode, team members and map the game is going on of course.  So we already know, this game is all about team work, and doing current game objective. Got it? Good, and keep it that way!  Let's go with the next thing - weapons! Even though there's not many of them, as the cosmetic items (that would be something) there's still a lot of them, to pick and choose from. And most of the weapons usually change to way of playing your current class, so it makes the game even more interesting and challenging. We have weapons that heal or overheal you on killing your opponent, slow down enemies who are shot, gives you speed boost, hurt enemy after attacking him... the list is long, every weapon have it's pros and cons, so everyone can choose, try out every weapon and stick with it, as this style of fighting with it fits him most. Thus makes your gameplay completely different everytime you join on a random server, with new random people.  More guns = more fun. Check them out, and find your style. That's our conclusion here. One tip though - every time you will get a new weapon, don't think you have advanced to a next level or something and this new weapon is way better than the previous one! Carry on...  Classes you're playing! There are 9 playable classes in game, avalible from the beggining, so there's no any 'This class avalible after reaching that level.' No. You can play as who do you want, from the beggining. So you can try out every game style and see which one fits you most, as with every class you're playing completely diffrently than with previous one. So, the classes are: Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and (my favourite) Spy. Every class have it's pros and cons, just like the weapons you can get so the choice of your favourite one are a little easier. For example - Scout is the fastest one of all the classes, can make double jumps and even capture points 2 times faster than anyone else. But he is really easy to kill in battle, unless you're good at dodging incomming spam of bullets and rockets. Much better for a frontal attack are classes like Soldier, armed with his rocket launcher and the possibility to do a 'Rocket Jump' to help him reach bigger distances in a short time, due to the fact he's really slow. But that's just a short example of everything that each class is avalible of. And honestly? Too lazy to write down all of them, that's all... meh.  Worth to mention, that every class have it's own personality, which makes them a bit more cooler and interesting to play with. Another example? Fine. Scout is pretty much kind of a cocky guy, who likes to annoy others, and think that every girl wants him, and every guy wish to be like him. Soldier is a stereotypical example of an American patriot, who most likely lost all his brain cells durning WW2. Heavy is a very calm and serious guy, until his minigun starts to spin and the battle starts. Then he's like a wild, angry bear, that hates people. And so it goes as well, with the other 6 classes.  So, 9 different mercs for a usually 12-24 teams. Sounds cool? Because it is... that is, until most of them are only Spies or Snipers.  Exactly, most of the players think that this game is like CoD - thus they go full sniper force, believing they have nailed everything. No, no, NO! This game is nothing like CoD! A team full of snipers, will never win. I was once in a team where out of 10 players we had 8 snipers, one spy and a soldier which was me. So, I think you can say how that round went? (inb4 MLG jokes) So, what I mean is - teamwork is important, we know that. But, when there's not enough classes that will provide enough firepower for the team, the teamwork won't help you much, or does not exist there at all.  Okay, time to move on to...  HATS! This is something completely random, that makes this game unique. In this game, you can wear on every class a nice and fancy hat, or other cosmetic, that will make you look diffrent from the others. Here's my question - can you wear a hat in every other FPS, than Team Fortress 2? No. Or dance Conga? Of course not. Or being a total annoying brat and taunting after every kill, no matter how much skill you put into your kill? Of course not! Another reason why TF2 is so unique, and why we love it so much.  Okay, slowly getting tired of thinking what to poot here. So, conclusion time!  Team Fortress 2 is an awesome game, unique in her own beautiful way and great to play. I recommend playing it, together with your friends! 'But they have no money...' This game's free! Just download, learn how to play and get good!  The only thing that makes me really angry about this game are most of the time unbalanced teams, the autobalance curse in the worst possible moment of the round, or the fact the prices are getting higer in its shop..."
7.8/10 Too much ducks  -IGN
Hat Simulator. 10/10 would recommend.
  Latest Update Completely Ruined It
"Team Fortress 2 is a popular F2P FPS over the country. This game is actually one of the best game Valve ever made, I'm not saying that this game is the best one among all the games that Valve made. The only thing players love about this game are hats, yes, hats, the economy of Team Fortress 2 will be hats ans cosmectics. Why not weapons you said, well, it is very difficult to have a new weapon because of the weapon's stats and when a weapon goes wrong, the game will not be balanced making this 'unfair'. So, I know some of the players in Team Fortress 2 just focus on weapons and not focusing on hats and they just quit Team Fortress 2, I know a lot of players did this because who doesn't want new weapons? Now... Valve are now looking into the Steam Workshop of Team Fortress 2 to find new weapons for the game and even hats, every damn time. Yes, you're actually playing the future Hat Simulator.  When I first played Team Fortress 2, around 2008, I forgot where I started playing it, but nevermind, just stick to around 2008. This game is well optimized, but it sucks up a lot of your CPU Usage though. This game is well optimized, I said again, I mean, most maps are smooth making you having a good FPS. Well, Valve is actually a big company due to popular, fun, optimized game and etc...  The graphics in this game looks 'cartoonish' and when the Graphic settings are all 'Low' the game will still run the graphic to 'pretty'. I know that graphics doesn't make a game better, only story does. Oh and I forgot to mention that this game has a story, just check their wiki and read the comics, the story won't show up in-game. And let's get back to the graphic I last said, the graphic looks 'cartoonish', I mean, who doesn't like cartoonish graphics? Trust me, it's beautiful, just like the Borderlands series, it's cartoonish.   There are 9 classes in this game: Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, Spy. The Scout focus on speed and agility and Scout captures Control Point x2 faster. The Soldier focus on DPS by using his Rocket Launcher, very useful on a pocket Medic. The Pyro will uses 'his' or 'her' Flamethrower to start a fire to the enemy for afterburn damage. Demoman will focus on defense and offense with his Stickybomb Launcher due to the DPS or he can focus on Melee or Demoknight for short. The Heavy is the tank, he's also good at being a pocket and also wield a Minigun but the damage isn't high. The Engineer focuses on defending and uses his Sentry Gun to defend points, he can also equip the Gunslinger to build Mini-Sentry and also becoming Offensive Engineer, the Engineer can use his Shotgun or Pistol to deal with enemies instead of his Sentry doing it. The Medic focuses on Support, the medic is a MUST on all team due to healing and ubercharge. The Sniper also a support class, the sniper stays back front of the battlefield to support his team-mates. And lastly, the Spy, he is very mysterious, you won't know he is behind you or not you better watch out his backstabbing skills and also watch out for your 'fake' team-mates, the spy can disguise as your team-mate and act like them so watch out!  After a lot of hours playing this game, I should like to rate:  10/10 Amazing"
"I used to know what social life was, thanks to this game i don't know anymore. Thanks lord Gabe Newell"

Best game ever c:
"I've played this game for a couple years now, and have stuck by it's side through thick and thin. I've seen multiple update rages, many update praises, and so much more. That doesn't even begin to explain the time I've had playing the game though. TF2 has so many amazing things you can do and even specialize in.  You can pick from 9 classes, and several different weapon combinations within those classes to perfect your own playstyle. Technically speaking, the game isn't limited to 9 classes either. Slap a sword and shield on your Demoman and you get a Demoknight, a completely different playstyle from the bomb lobbing drunk scottish man. Slap a gunslinger and a few good weapons on the Engineer and you get the Combat Engineer, a more aggressive member of the team who (when played right) can actually help more than you think. There's so much more to the game than just a simple shooter, with community servers running custom gamemodes that you wouldn't even expect to be in a game like this. While not all are fun, give them a try, you may like them.  The community has its ups and downs, but most communities have those. Occasionally you will find a really toxic player, which can ruin the moods of many people, or someone really salty, or a troll, but don't let them get to you. Try to be the good in the community, and maybe things will change. Me? I'll admit, I can be quite toxic and salty A LOT of the time, but I try to be good where it counts.  You've got hundreds, even thousands of game groups all specializing in certain things in TF2, whether it be your favorite gamemode or a group dedicated to Rocket Jumping, there's almost everything you could want from it. Updates: a very controversial subject (especially recently with the Meet Your Match update) I will admit when MYM first came out, I was part of the angry torch toting crowd bent on destroying Valve, but they very quickly noticed that the community was not taking too kindly to the update, and made some announcements and changes. Valve doesn't always listen, but when they do, they do a good job of it. They've tried at least a LITTLE to fix the problem, atleast give them credit for that. Give them time, I'm sure we'll all come back to it eventually, and Valve will get stuff fixed up. There's A LOT and I really do mean A LOT of things I haven't explained here in TF2, you just gotta play it and find them for yourself. Whether or not you enjoy the game isn't up to me, and I wouldn't feel any different if you hated it, I'm not going to shove it down your throat (Okay... Maybe a little.)  TL;DR Play the game, don't get mad, lots of features, don't be toxic, more than displayed. Try to enjoy games, no matter what situation you are in. People can be crappy, just get through it and don't and fuel to the flames."
"valve recently made a statement saying this  'It's no secret that Casual Mode has had a rough launch. We wanted to give you an update on what we're doing to address your concerns.  Short version: We hear you. Later today, we will be shipping a patch to Casual Mode that will remove the penalties for abandoning a game, and allow you to narrow your game mode selections from two modes to a single mode before queuing. Additionally, in the very near future, we will be shipping a more comprehensive Casual Mode patch that will let you select the maps you will be matched into.  We've provided a more detailed breakdown of Casual Mode's issues and how we are addressing your concerns below.  First, and most important, queue times. The queue times you are currently experiencing are a bug, not a feature. It is something we are actively working to correct. Several backend issues appeared post-launch that culminated in long wait times. Removing this issue is our highest priority right now.  Second, abandonment penalties. We had put in a ten-minute cooldown period to encourage players to complete matches. Your feedback has convinced us that it is more important for players to be able to come and go as they please. Today's patch will remove abandonment cooldown penalties from Casual Mode.  Third, user choice. We'd intended to roll out the number of match options available to players incrementally, so as not to overload the matchmaking system with too many variables on Day One. In retrospect, of all the match options to hold back, map selection should not have been one of them. It is the next feature we are adding to Casual Mode, and you will get it very soon.  Fourth, Casual Mode levels. Levels are a cosmetic feature that show how much you've played. They can never be lost, and they do not affect matchmaking. We did a poor job of communicating that Casual Mode Levels are in no way similar to Competitive Mode Ranks (which do affect matchmaking, and can be lost).  Finally, we wanted to note that we value the role the community plays in the development of this game, and do in fact read all the feedback sent to us, as well as through reddit, the forums, streams, and more. We are not always as talkative as we perhaps should be, but we are listening.'"
I dare you to find a better combat MMO
"Been playing for years, but this new matchmaking update really put this game to ♥♥♥♥. The UI was fine, I don't know why you guys butchered it to death."
It's TF2! do I need to say more?
VERY GOOD GAME ITS AWESOME YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE YOUR CHARACTER AND GET NEW WEAPONS AND BUY STUFF FROM THE STORE ITS FREE TO PLAY AND ITS THE BEST FPS GAME EVER
One of my favorite games of all time... and it's free!  So what are you waiting for? Play it already!
"Best hat simulator game I have played so far. Here is why.  + You get 9 choices of hat modelers from different ethnicities. (The Russian and German models are probably the worst models, because they don’t wear a default hat)  + You get a lot of different locational maps to model you hat in. (Best with western hat modeling)  + You can team up with others in what I assume are competitive hat modeling competitions, like Capture the Hat, Control Hat, king of the Hat, Mann vs. Hatted Robots, Hatload, and Hatted Delivery.  + Super cheap hats in the games hat store. $12.99 for a “Bubble Pipe Hat” What a steal! (I think they should increase these prices, or they might run out items. I already bought this item 26 times in case they ever do run out of hats)    Some things I did not like about the simulator.  - You get these weird metal hats drops called “weapons”, which you can’t even wear on your head! They only go in your hands! What idiotic developer decided that putting hats on their hands is a good idea! There only real use in the game is to be crafted into “scrap hat metal”, which you can then trade in for real hats. "
 Team Fortress 2
Well this time TF2 is absolutely dead (unless they can do a full reverse). Goodbye TF2.
"This is a great game, especially a few years ago when the market was better and a key was 2.55 ref. Much more fun with friends and just an overall good game to play."
Very fun to play with friends and good time play with others from other lands
I start playing TF2 a few years ago.  During some Updates it changed alot but it always had 9 different classes alot of opportunitis and possible playstiles and make me have alot of fun every day.  Since the last update alot of things changed you now playing in ranked gamemeodes comparable to the CS:GO stuff but not as good as CS:GO ranks. But still: you could enjoy playing on these Valve ranked servers or just go out and play on a community server.  Always alot of fun and I would recommend it everyone
Its a pretty good game played it a little bit
One of the best shooters from Valve ...!!!

"This game ruined my life  in this game you shoot people with no hats,black and broken hats,hats,hats that doesnt harm the wearer even it is burning,somehow it is fun and addicting as hell   hat+guns+skill+cartoon+ponies(sad i know)+f2p+burning hats= tf2 "
"I love this game, it's so much fun."
"Team Fortress 2: I played it about 2.377 hours so I guess I can judge about how good/bad Team Fortress 2 acutally is. I really like the trade system, hats with different qualities etc. but I guess for new players it's quite hard to get into the game. If you want to play a game for fun reasons and chilling on some nice customized maps Team Fortress 2 is the game you need. Do you want to play serious and show everybody how good you are? Play Competitive. It's really amazing and you can always learn. Do you want to spend (much) money in the game, buy good-looking items and trade? Buy some keys and get started with your great trading career! All this describes Team Fortress 2.  From Fun servers where everybody doing taunts to serious gameplays with money as a reward and as well trading high-quality items.  Get Team Fortress 2 for a mixture of fun, competitive spirits and trading success. 10/10 for one of my favorite games!"
"Just amazing.... Valve made a masterpiece to be followed with this game!  but when kids start screaming into the mic, the fun goes down :/  9/10"
"Hat fortress 2, oh sorry Team Fortress 2, is a multiplayer fps focusing on cooperating with your allies to complete objectives or stop the other team from completing theirs. At your arsenal you have 9 unique classes with hundreds of weapons of your choosing. You find 'random drops' in form of weapons as you play, allowing you to try out new weapons and eventually finding your favourite combos.  Unlike other popular fps games, TF2 focus on advancing with your team and fill in for your allied classes weaknesses. While a heavy class have great damage output, his slowness makes him a sitting duck. A medic class can keep him alive and together advance into enemy territory to do damage. In another example, an engineer class can setup a small base for allies to heal, refill ammo and have a few seconds of not being fired upon. Against a demolition class like soldier or demoman, he can just watch as his buildings are wrecked, however with the support of a pyro, their explosives can be turned against them. Some weapons are even specifically made to support another class in battle.  The real gem of TF2 is however it's crazy customization. You can equip all kinds of hats, clothes and other miscs, making your classes stand out.   And not only that, TF2 even got a huge economy, with thousands of other players involved into. Trade a weapon or a hat with a friend, profit on selling your rare misc or simply hoard it all! It's all up to you  Pros: Crazy fun gameplay, badass costimization, hilarious voice acting, huge economy and one of the longest surviving fpses on the market. oh and FREE  Cons: To avoid having to play for tons of hours to try out all weapons, the in-game store sells extremly overpriced items. Trading however enables you to get everything cheaper but new players will have trouble with this. To make your items tradable, you are required to buy a premium upgrade (which you can by buying the cheapest item in the store so not too expensive)"
"pyro won. thx valve, litterally 50% of the players play only pyro now and about 99,9% are w+m1 pyros, u destroyed it."

"If you're looking for a challenging FPS, that'll give you hours of competitive gameplay, aswell as an unique community, and amazingly fun weapons allowing you to get creative, look no further! Team Fortress 2 is one of the most fun, amazing, one-of-a-kind games that i've played. Not alone does the 9 different classes grow on you, the game itself is amazing! Featuring unique, fun gamemodes as Payload, or atk/def.  If you're not conviced just yet, the game allows you to customize your classes with hats and miscs, community created, aswelll as valve's own!  All in all, Team Fortress is by the community, for the community. Now i understand if you find looking at people, and clicking hard, or cook that grenade just right, but in Team Fortress 2 you dont nessecarily have to. There's much more to the game, than just being the first to draw fire. Heck, there aint even that many guns!  To top it all off, it's free! you might think 'Ah, then its a pay-to-win..', and you'd be absolutely wrong. With the unique Drop System you'll be sure to aquire new firearms by the end of the day (If not a hat or two!)"
Its free. nuff said
Choose to play a friendly round of hitting people with a shovel while still in the air or just trade virtual items for real life profit. The choice is yours
still fire but not as much as it used to
This game makes me moist
"Well, there's hats, there's guns, there's swords, there's (literally)♥♥♥♥. There's burning hats(literally burning). More hats Shirts, pants, and hats.  Did I mention hats?"
"Tis geim very god and ♥♥♥♥, hats is cool but need lukc find and geimblay is gud lik you go as tiim wit class like pryro or spei. my favorit is demmo becuase is exblosiev and very tactik to blay. but hevey is also very god it can many kill but he slow alsoy not verry usevufl lone rage compat. som stuf cost monei but u can blay frie! 4.5/5 not 5/5 becuse no kilsteak.overral very god geim but very moneis cans go and time if go buy key and open box and traed hat. soemtimes u get no hat but srtraeng wepin.... moneis lose."

I'm sorry. It was a great game. Buuuut they destroyed it :/   With all these 'Casual' and Competitive modes it's not the same anymore.   At this state of the game I can not recommend it to anyone.

From riches to rags.
watched Lord of The Rings triology three times in a row while waiting for casual round. 10/10 would watch Lord of The Rings triology three times in a row again
"Early review, I will add more after I play a few more hours. In the little time I have played TF2 I noticed I was really bad. A friend suggested I just keep practicing. Another friend said if I go phlog pyro (whatever that means) I would get more frags. I discovered the secret to success. I will now share it with you all in hopes that my facts help you become a better fragger.   CAUTION SPOILER BELOW     Buy hats, lots of hats. The more hats you have in your backpack, the better player you are. It's a proven fact.     Now I am sure other reviewers have mentioned my great idea to success, however, I am far too lazy to read other people's reviews. Maybe after I have a few more hours played I will try the phlog pyro trick.    Until then, I leave you with 3 thoughts: First, this game is free, stop reading reviews and try it for yourself. Secondly, find a few servers to favorite, and blacklist the ones with 9yr old admins and kids who get mad when you left click better than them. They are cancer and will ruin your experience. Third and finally, wait, did I just say 3? I knew it, Half Life 3 confirmed. You're welcome nerds.  It's still fun after 3500 hours....need I say more?"
the waviest game i ever did play. get it now
Good FPS. Also a good way to lose faith in humanity.
Want a game that you can play and make money and have no life? WELL THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU.
Just terrible after the latest update.
There is a Hot Dog hat. You pretty much cannot function in society without experiencing this.
this game ruined my life 10/10
This game absolutely destroyed my life. It made me kill my Wife AND sell my kids. I give this game and 11 out of 10.
The official Steam bandwagon
"I've got 3K hours, I'm entitled to complain.  Was a good game. Series of increasinly stupid updates that caused more bugs than they fixed, buffed classes that didn't need buffed (Let's make the spy run faster than a pyro!), nerfing classes that didn't need nerfed (Heavy and his alternative miniguns) that culminated in the Casual Update, I've got 200 dollars of Back Pack items that I won't be using anymore.  GG Valve, never paying for/dumping money into another Valve game. You guys have lost a customer.  ♥♥♥♥ like this makes me wonder if the Devs even play the ♥♥♥♥ing game they made."
"This game's aight. I only have like 95% of my friends playing it, so yeah."
dis game is da best of da best everyone should play!!!
this game is amazing =DDD
"Quite simply, this is THE best multiplayer FPS of all time. If you're on Steam and you don't have Team Fortress 2 in your game collection, you cannot call yourself a gamer - it's THAT essential. Perfectly balanced, infinitely playable and as addictive as a chocolate-covered crack cocaine sandvich, this is as much fun today as it was when on release. And what's more, it's FREE! Some may bemoan the cartoon aesthetic, but if you wan't depressing realism, go play the tediously repetitive CS:GO. For me, this is by far the most multiplayer fun you can have with a mouse in your hand. Get this on your system and get playing. You won't regret it...  UPDATE: Well, obviously I'm nominating TF2 for the Steam Awards 'Test Of Time' category, and here's me updating this review to check off my final badge slot!"
"Used to be a great game. This update is a joke. Was the Heavy (&lt;3) vs. Pyro just a distraction for how bad this update was? I'd just like to play TF2, where I could pick a server where people I know were on it and go play. Not wait 5 minutes+ to join a high ping, random map not of my choosing. I know there's community servers, but they all seem to enjoy High Tower a bit too much. This update has made many players leave, congrats, Volvo.  Oh, and please reove your 'fair and balanced' critical hits."
Do I recommend this game? It's like asking me if I eat ♥♥♥♥ for breakfast. Of course
Havent played much but from what i've seen so far it looks alright.
"Valve are a bunch of inbred rtаrds who have no idea how to maintain a multiplayer game. How about you hire somebody competent, eh?"
"Why did you change matchmaking, all i ever did was use the browser to join servers so i could join friends and play maps that i wanted to easily with little wait time, it took me 15 minutes to get into a frontieer game, i like the new matchmaking but the convenience of a quick match has really been destroyed because you need to play through an entire match before you can join another. So if im playing and a friend comes on halfway through my match he cant join me and i cant join him until my match is finished which really sucks. just make my life easy again"
I think Team Fortress 2 is a pretty cool guy. Eh kills scoots and doesnt afraid of anything.
0/10  Please uninstall right away.
It's ok.  Update: It's still ok.
"Valve are a bunch of inbred rtаrds who have no idea how to maintain a multiplayer game. How about you hire somebody competent, eh?"
this game is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid
"Ever since I played tf2 for my first 200 hours it was really fun,I continue playing it because of how fun it is but ever since the meet your match update has came up it basicly just made tf2 dying slowly,like is valve really lisening to the community or not? My 1300 hours of tf2 was great but valve please listen to the community   Ps:If you are triggered don't comment it about it,if you do your a pleb"
It's like SeaWorld But Better.  Who has two thumbs and like this game? Probably you if you get it!
"Yeah, it's alright."
This is the best free game I have ever played
Valve just royally ♥♥♥♥ed this game over. Stop trying to be Overwatch. This is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and how it EVER MADE IT PAST IDEA PHASE SHOWS HOW MONUMENTALLY OUT OF TOUCH VALVE IS WITH ITS PLAYERBASE. Casual isn't even ♥♥♥♥ing casual anymore. This game was fundamentally casual and we asked for a competitive mode not an entire revamp of the god damn system. Absolutely furious. Worst update to any game I have EVER seen in all my years of gaming.  0/10. Will only change if they manage to fix this colossal ♥♥♥♥ up.
you will hate the new update 
"Yay, hats! Also a fun time waster."
"This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fulfill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels. The game has an active dev team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons or game modes.  At the time of this review, there are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'.  Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objective or objectives for each team to achieve.  'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, 'Mann Up', gives rewards upon completing a 'tour'.  In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available.  In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them.  The game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play. I have been playing since November 2007 and I still return to the game on a regular basis. "
"HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS....... and sometimes, guns. BUT MOSTLY HATS"
"Listen i played this game before meet your match and quit before it, i quit because the game was lacking fun, after achieving skill you cant test it in a competitive enviroment, which is terrible, the hit reg is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, the game just gets dull after a while, and it just dies out it becomes boring and not fun anymore, i hoped meet your match would change that, but it only ♥♥♥♥ed up the game more"

"After 4000 hours, Valve has completely ruined the amazing experience this game had to offer. They forced a casual, lighthearted and extremely fun pubgame into a toxic wasteland of rage and tryhards.  'Casual' play is absolutely terrible. Letting you wait half an hour only to place you in a game: - With a map you don't like - On the team you don't want to be on - In a gamemode you don't actually want to play  It's an utter and complete disappointment."
"Fun to play with friends! Just play the game, you easily unlock achievements without trying hard and get decent item drops.   It is definitely more fun when you learn more about the classes and go online against other players. I do consider it to be a unique game where hours do not give you much of an advantage against newer players but knowledge and skill is what makes the difference."
Team fortress is the best game ever I played especially mge and Hightower they are the best maps I ever played on and I hope tf2 continue becoming even better 
"Way to go Valve, you have officially killed TF2."
Wow such game. Join our group :)
They say Overwatch killed TF2. TF2 is killing itself.
"TF2 has been going downhill with every update being more reskins and more bugs. With competitive broken along with every other game mode, valve simply doesn't care about fixing tf2 as long as there's money to be made from the 7th reskin of the rocket launcher."
TOP GAME 10/6 would play over overwatch HELL ILL BUY OVERWATCH AND TELL EM TO PLAY TF2 
Waffles.
"I've played this since 2010. It used to be very fun, but the new matchmaking system has made it almost unplayable. and no rd_asteriod."
The best war themed hat simulator ever to exist in the world ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ and you can buy or get weapons which are basically the same but just have a different skin and makes you waste a ton of money like wanna get a alien pistol reskin that doesn't do anything new except make your enemies into ash and cosmetics that do nothing to your game but we Still a want them and basiclly have these skins to be expensive since just the skin
"'YOU DONE ♥♥♥♥ED IT UP!' -AngryJoe. _______________________  I remember when I found out about Team Fortress 2 5 years ago, 'twas a new game for me, I got hooked and continued playing until early 2016. Team Fortress 2 was the beginning of fresh air: No typical 'super-hero, military teenager drama', and no 'saving the world' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ - this game is mainly to play objectives and have fun.  In its prime, Team Fortress 2 was a great game, it had innovation and diversity... first, let me cover what the game does right: The gunplay feels solid 'enough' per-se. The melee-combat is ok, they're nothing clunky and they're nothing fancy. The graphics, sounds, voice-lines and the blasphemous logic helps to catch the cartoonish atmosphere that TF2 holds and the source-engine nails its job at all of those aspects.   Now, the bad and the ugly: The bad, is that throughout the years 2007 to 2016, the team behind TF2 has devolved it into an average first-person-shooter. Meaningless matchmaking, non-rewarding level-system and item-drop system, messed up weapon-balancing, bad form for crafting and a mind-numbingly terrible and toxic community.   The ugly, TF2 suffers from bad opimisation. Meaning that you'll get massive frame-rate drops when you enter a server. The maps has game glitches/bugs that you'll be able to sit somwhere near the skybox and inside a wall. There are other game glitches/bugs in TF2 that it's impossible for me to name them all. Players are exploiting them, and that has been going on since the game was released, or somewhere near that factor. The hard fact that none of the players has alerted Valve that their game is technically unfinished for nearly 10 years, is mind-blowing!  Valve are also at fault here, because ever since the Gun Mettle, Tough Break and Meet Your Match updates, TF2 has become a significantly average, typical and an edgy first-person-shooter. It pains me to say this because I loved this game, but there's no point in playing a game that is no longer appealing to me, or you for that matter. And DON'T YOU ♥♥♥♥ING DARE valve, to make another update where you have to pay dosh to participate in it!  I'am the angryjoeshow-nostalgiacritic-wannabe guy, and I'll remember it so you don't have too and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera... *walks out of the door*"
moment they started adding hats games fate was sealed. Now entire artstyle is ruined and game is one big mess especially with custom p2w servers and f2p community.

"TF2 is trendy; when you see others looking cool, you want to be cool too."
"Game is dying faster and faster each update, Devs no longer care."
"This game has hats. I can't afford hats. But I'm always trying to aquire hats. Why should you get hats, you say? Hats make you look cool. Why do they make you look cool? Because you can't afford them.  10/10 would dream again."
Why arn't you playing this game? Its free AND you can actually make some money out of selling strange and geniune weapons and misc :D
THIS IS AWESOME!!!
This game was really fun and can play it with you friends.
"One of the, if not THE BEST class based multiplayer games I have ever played . Adequately balanced nd loads of fun. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ."
Its worth the download
"The best Free To Play shooter with absolutely no limitations in terms of access to the game aside from Cosmetic Drops and Custom Servers. Otherwise, the entire game is free. Getting premium is as cheap as 99c, just buy something from the store and boom! Premium account."
:)
"This is my all time favourite multiplayer game. I've put so many hours into it and it was worth every second. That beng said, the game is not what it used to be. I remember when the Orange Box came out back in the day and this was the only thing I played on PS3 and PC. There were only developer maps, no hats, and a couple unlockable weapons. Now it's to the point where it's not about the gameplay, strategy, and diverse characters and playstyles. It's all about hats, hats, hats. I thought hats were a great intoduction to the franchise and made every character unique because hats were rare and there were only 3-4 to each character. Then when it became F2P, all of the new era of TF2 players came in. It's to the point where there's so many unlockables, and maps, etc. I even had 100% achievements at one point, but more and more kept being added along with everything else materialistic (per se). I can't even keep up anymore. It feels waaaayyyy different than what I used to like about it. I still recommend this game to anybody and everybody. The game is just THAT good, but stay out of trading, achievement, and idle servers and rally some friends up and play some Payload or Control Points, or CTF. That's where you'll have the most fun."
I'd recommend this game to everyone! It's a great game and i love it!
"Fun Stuff. Great friends. Pew Pew, NO Q, Q !!!"
"Hello followers of the Interweb, my name is Smite or Mo and welcome to my review for TF2!  Before I begin my review, I would like to tell you guys about the storyline of TF2 (even though there is no story mode &gt;.&lt;)  It all began with the Mann Family. Heard of the name? Yes, that's right! The Mann Co. The Mann Co was built around the 19th century by a wealthy Englishman that goes by the name of Zephaniah Mann. Fun fact: The Mann Co. store is actually called Mann &amp; Sons Munitions Concerns!) Zephaniah's wife, Bette Mann, gave birth to three sons. Their names were Redmond, Blutarch and Gray but their mother died at child birth.   The reason why there was no Gray team was because he was abducted by an eagle during the 'Great Eagle Scourge of 1822' Gray was well cared for and was fed grubs and mice.  In Zepheniah's will, he gave his sons (Blutarch and Redmond) half his land and they have to fight for the land for the rest of their lives.   Team Fortress 2 is a team based first person shooter with nine classes (currently) to pick from. They are all categoriesed into 3 sections. The sections are Offense, Defense and Support. For Offense you have the folowing classes: Scout, Soldier and Pyro. For Defense you have the following classes: Demoman, Heavy and Engineer. Lastly, for the support, you have the following classes: Spy, Medic and Sniper.  Heavy - Russia Scout - Bostion , USA Soldier - Midwest, USA Demoman - Ullapool, Scotland Medic - Stuttgart. Germany Spy - France Engineer - Bee Cave, Texas Sniper - Syndey, Austraila Pyro - Pyroland, Land of Rainbowz (Not true, but it's unkown because you can't hear he/she's voice due to gas mask muffling it's voice)  TF2 is a very well structured game created by VALVe and you could tell that they spent a lot of time and effort! Unlike a lot of games, TF2 is CPU Intensive unlike games such as Minecraft which depends primarily on your graphics card. I definately recommend this game to 12+ and people who normally have stressful days, which then means they could just kick back and play a game or two. I have played around a day's worth of TF2 and loved every second. I remember the days when Minecraft used to be my primary game but now its all about the TF2.  Please tell me if I made any faults in this review, other then that, thank you so much for reading this review, Mo Iz Out.   "
"If you like Dress up,War And,Wasting your Money this game is for you!"
FPS good game. Good graphic quality and very fun! Trading is also addicting in this game!
  it is a great game and funny
well... team fortress 2 is like minecraft but with more reallistic in it like i wish i could have lots of taunts and body were the point i get KILLED for like um... i realy don't know 
The most epic of epic games. 
"It's frickin' awesome game &lt;3 hats, miscs etc. You just don't get bored it."
"Team Fortress 2 Is A Good Game That Has Two Teams Battling In Some Gamemodes. Some Are Capture The Flag, Control Points, Attack And Defend, Ect. This Reveiw Was More Of How It's Lost A Lot Of It's Charm, Well At Least To Me. It's That Every Update After The Gun Mettle Update (BEST UPDATE EVER), The Game Has Slowly Gone Down The Hill. Let Me Show You What I Commented On One Of A Persons Videos Who Has A Communtity Skarle Medigun.   'Well, My Dreams And Hopes Of Getting A Community Sniper Rifle Can Never Happen Seeing That I Haven't And Probably Never Will Give Enough Support To Team Fortress 2. I've Lost A Big Amount Of Hope In TF2 Due To It's Last 2 Updates. My Brothers Are Telling Me That TF2 Now Sucks And Is Just Another Money Grab But I've Tried My Best To Keep Playing It And Hoping That A Good Update Comes If Or After The Mayann Update Comes. I Still Believe In Valve To Bring TF2 Back For Me.'  I Am Trying My Best To Keep Hope For Valve And Team Fortress Two, Hope That It Gets Better. BUT For New Players Hoping To Try This Game (They Shouldn't Be New Cause They Should Have This Game Already Cuz It's Good), I Say It's A Good Game. But This Review Is Mostly To Show Valve That I Am Running Out Of Reasons To Either Dump Money Into This Game Or Mostly, Love This Game. Please... Give Me A Reason To Love The Game..."
"Great game, tons of player made servers if you get bored in pubs! Many game modes, you'll never get bored! AND DONT FORGET HATS EVERYONE LOVES HATS"
"This game was pretty fun for a long time. It got a bit stale because Valve has no concept of time and waited a damned eternity to update the game to add competitive. The only reliable updates have been new cosmetics, because all they seem to give a ♥♥♥♥ about now is making money off of the microtransactions.  I haven't tried the comp mode yet because I've been burnt on 'casual' mode. I love waiting 15 minutes to join a match where it becomes 'Whichever team stacks the most Heavies/Medics wins.' I love it, I really do. Nothing makes me happier than having to choose between suffering through 15 minutes of constantly dying or 15 minutes of doing nothing while I wait for a new game. There isn't really pubstomping anymore unless you want to pick through every community server on the list. This update is -so- bad, I want my money back. Literally all of it. Every key, cosmetic, MvM ticket I ever bought I want refunded.  I used to like Valve and I used to like this game.  Update 29 Oct, 2016: Loading a casual match only takes 3-5 minutes instead of 15. Matches are still ♥♥♥♥ and the wait times only exacerbate my irritation and displeasure in this game. It's free-to-play, but I wouldn't recommend you even spend that much money."
"Everything is perfect, the graphics, game play it's a really fun game, but there is one thing I dislike, alot. it's about the one inventory it used to be 10+ but after future updates it just became one, i have more items then one inventory (Two Point two) and everytime I play in a commuinty server and die it shows this 'Do You Need More Space?' at it asks me to pay to get the damn thing, and I cant close or go back to the game so I dicide to close the game then restart it. Lucky not all, servers do this, fast-respawning does'nt show the 'Do you need more space' which really makes my suprised. Also, the game is 'free to play' you need to buy items if you want but buying inventory? not my taste. But any how, I just really liked the old mechinces from the new ones these updates make me, hate the game even more, to rarely make me play with freinds in it, and most likely to never play the game again (Or to delete the game) but I will be very happy if it comes fine and cool, if not, well, as I said I will never play the game again. (probably)"
"Black text review, PART II:  So, Team Fortress 2...  This    piece    of    brilliance   ...  It made me waste my money on some    good-looking    hats that make your character look like a    fancy    piece of    'mentlegentleman'   . The classes are incredibly    fun to play   , especially that bloody Pyro class. I f*cking    love    him!  Oh, and they call this F2P? That's    great   !   Valve, please   never   stop making these    great    &amp;    fun    games. I    love you    guys.  Peace."
TF2 isnt a new game but the things inside the game updating almost every day. My second game on Steam is TF2 but this is my favourite. The server of this game is good. I enjoy playing this game. Until I play it for more than 300 hours I think it is a good game ever!!!!!!!!
Play it I think it's the best game out there bec there's crazy stuff happening and you are playing with people you don't know and you can be friends with them so plz play it I'm sure you will love it.
i hate this game but i continue to play it because i hate myself even more
Yeah... Umm... I really didn't intend to spend so much time playing this.  Actually that isn't the real confession.               I really didn't intend to spend so much money on virtual hats.  11/10
"Good game, once you start playing it, you can't stop"
"Hats. So many beautiful, virtual hats"
5/5
10/10 i love being called gay and the screaming squeakers &lt;3
1- hate that game (still hate it tho) 2- my friend told me to install it and ♥♥♥♥ p__p (still hate it tho) 3- i did it p___p (still hate it tho) 4- still hate that game (still hate it tho) 10/10 hate it and play it in the same time p___p (still hate it tho)
I love this game it is really good and should be the number one multiplayer game. 
"Update 9/21/2016 - It's near unplayable, the new menu is nice, but the peroformance is soooo bad it makes me feel sad. One step forward and two steps back - thats the way this game is getting it's updates.  Even on a pc that's waaaay above the recommended specs the optimisation is soo bad im forced to play with low graphics settings and on dx 8 and still on some maps it drops down below 40  This game seriously needs more optimisation  EDIT: Besides the performance issues the game is really fun to fap to.  :)"
You have Steam. You have Team Fortress 2. Simple as that.
"I have Enough Experience and Enough Hours to Describe and Review, this game  I started to play this on 2008 On the Orange box On Xbox360, I never played it because i bough the orange box because of Half life series and portal, when i tried this game i really just like it for a couple of months because then i started getting bored of it. Then when i installed steam in 2010 I wanted Free to play games and i saw Team fortress 2, I wanted to get back to the old days and play it but now, it was totally Different. Now there was New guns, Hats And stuff, I got really addicted to the game,Not because of the hats, but of the weapons in general, and then i started being a fan of the game, I Learned the news and Guide. I Pretty much think the game is balanced with the controllers and the game mode, I thing The game today day has been a really cool game and Does't need to be a Team fortress 3 because Tf2 Is pretty good and balanced. I been playing this game since im 9 Years old, and I practically Know everything(but im not that good at the game lmao) About trading,How to not get scammed, How to make your BP Worth more etc etc The game is pretty good but sometimes They screw the games with updates BUT the game is pretty cool and one of the best FPS Games i ever played.  9/10"
&gt;Get on Trade Server &gt;1 guys spamming Russian Songs on mic &gt;1 kid yelling how he got scammed &gt;Endless Trade Requests &gt;Get on Payload Server &gt;Same 10/10 Best Hat Simulator
Conga Hat Simulator 2015. Do I need to explain more?
"Great game, So much things to do, Trade, Fight, Design your character to look the best! Updates just keep coming, THis game honestly doesn't ever get boring, Great game!"
"Take the downvoting reviews with a grain of salt. The community complains about pretty much every update. It's a free game and at it's base, it still works. I like it."
"my favorite , action packed , good graphics , really good game"
Best firstperson sharpshooter game i ever played
THIS GAME IS AWESOME! its a serious and not serious game! I love this game is serious and not serious! I can give this +84816416734975646579456§19034 points! LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!
"Was a great game but the latest update killed it. Queues for servers, can't kick all the cheaters (of which there are many),, placing me on laggy servers at the other end of the world. Please bring back the old Valve pubs and roll back the crazy changes (spy - speedboost - seriously? Heavy nerfed more?)"
"-&gt; Install TF2 -&gt; Play random pubs as pyro -&gt; W+M1, kill things -&gt; Play solly -&gt; Corner spam rockets, kill things -&gt; Play scout -&gt; You can't hit anything and dies a lot. Gives up on scout forever. -&gt; Play heavy -&gt; You kill a whole lot of things bc for some reason people keep running into your spun up minigun.  -&gt; Starts to think you're good at this game after 100 hours -&gt; You'll then spent time playing mvm, slender, prophunt, deathrun, jailbreak, dodgeball, saxton hell, etc -&gt; At this point, you'll start wasting your money on hats or spending all your time trading for hats. -&gt; You think you're even better after 500 hours -&gt; You start playing comp. lobbies on TF2Center -&gt; You get destroyed   Now you either  -&gt; Uninstall or you keep playing TF2 forever in your life.   ggwp"
Over 4500 hours and still playing.  Enough said.  Best game.
I miss the old TF2....
"Some update happened while I was away for the summer, I come back and the game is unrecognizable and unplayable. I look at the patch notes and I'm dissapointed. Why would valve screw their game up like this? Does valve even play their own games? They should and then realize exactly what needs to be fixed. Their don't communicate strategy is beginning to fail them.  Please valve pick up your ♥♥♥♥, and keep it in the toilet where it belongs. Don't rub it all over one of my favorite games."
"Gaben What the actual ♥♥♥♥ have you done to Team Fortress 2? How did your mind think about this 'update' for the game? All TF2 gamers are angry with you because you killed a magnificent game I mean I MUST WAIT 30 MINUTES TO PLAY A 2 MINUTES MATCH? EVEN IF I JUST WANTED TO COME FOR A MATCH AND MAYBE RECEIVE AN ITEM, I MUST GO TAKE A ♥♥♥♥ AND PLAY CHESS WITH MY GRANDMA TWICE TO ENTER A MATCH Gabe please, take TF2 back from the dead."
Its bad
"Just equip the beam gun, it aims for you :3"
"If awesome virtual hats and dance taunts, plus a pretty rad color scheme and hilariously cartoonish graphics sound interesting to you, than you're probably going to want to play some Team Fortress 2!"
10/10 It has Team Deathmatch. And it also has Meme Deathmatch. And Doesn't have Microtransactions. best game of 2016.
Team fortress 2 was very good game... till meet your match update  Valve pls change team fortress back how it was  because its not fun anymore like it was before  
Competitive is the worst ♥♥♥♥ing thing to happen to Team fortress since it's release there is nothing I hate more then one person quitting a match half way through and then learning after the game that since one person quit nobody gets XP thats a bunch of horse ****. And not to mention you spend fifty hours trying to win a match and if you lose all your xp you gained is taken away the system is rigged if you're looking for a equal match up look elsewhere a level one with a level 5 this gives me cancer sorry but I am offically uninstalling tf2 for the first time....VALVE FIX YOUR NO NO!
Played it some. Pretty good. Hats are important though.
Warning; this game is to addictive for the following 'average' gamer. If you want to play this game prepare your self for a quest for unusuals and australium weapons which you will never lay your comic holding hands on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"this is a bad game for you, your life will never go back to normal, you are now in the world with kids with 2 hours on cp_orange server you will spend alot of time on this server you feel like you are gettin better, 2000+ hours later you found out that the world of tf2 is not only you thinking you are a good trader or the orange servers there are funny things to do you find a friend in a badlands server he tells you all the things about comp tf2, you wanna do it, you will do it, you are going to do it, and 6 sessons later you find out you are in a prem team, it goes up for you that you have no life what so ever and you take a break... you have played this game to much you stop playing it for a while, you come back to it you see that have a life and you kove the life you have and you begin playing tf2 again but... 2 days after this you die, you did not live your life, you did not take a break, you did not get on a badlands server, you never played tf2 comp, and it goes up fo ryou that you really did not have a life....."
This game is not for people who think cod is superior. Cod isn't tf2. just like a lemon isn't like an orange.
"Team Fortress 2 is hands-down the funnest game for trading and just playing for fun. Yeah CounterStrike is fun, but that is more of a competitive game. Team Fortress originially went through many titles and ideas, until they came within an idea. That idea was having two teams, Red, and Blu, having nine classes, Scout, Soildier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and a Spy. All these classes were very thought out and disputed like how they are. This is one of the best games ever made for millions of people, but I would like,  More Cosmedics, Bug Fixes, WAY More SFM's, etc.  To conclude this, I will be going by saying Team Fortress 2 is a very fun cartoony style game, and I will recommend for any interested people to play. Thank you for the time reading this."
I-It's not like I like this game or anything &gt;///&gt;
"Body explosions, Medic!!, SWAG, Hats!, MORE HATS!, BOOOONK!  Anymore to say?  11/10"
Literally just reviewing this for the steam badge.
"Don't worry, source 2 will fix it."
"TF2 used to be the, 'casual, jump in and jump out when you feel' fps, but now its just CS:GO with classes. Valve killed TF2, gg. Until this gets fixed, ill be playing with bots instead of TF:GO."
"The new update ruined the game. A lot. Valve looked at Overwatch and said 'Oh hey, let's do that' and it ended up ruining the game. Please bring the old TF2 back."
"'100% of the community wants to play competitive 100% of the time according to the 100% competitive players we asked'  This game is no longer about just having fun. Now it's all about E-sport. Now it's all about competitive. Now it's all about winning. Nine years of turning the game into a casual, just jump in and play, game has been completely destroyed. I never thought I would see the day that I actually quit TF2, but I guess that day is today. Thanks for the 3,500 hours of fun Valve. I'll never forget it."
"Sell your wife, sell your kids because valve are ruining everybody's fun time with this game, It doesn't need to be like CS:GO since the community to that game is the mother of all toxic and now TF2 will join it, sat there on teams that are brokenly balanced and you can't have a friend without first leaving your game but then you're banned and can't play with friend because you're on a cooldown for 'playing' on a server with little to any fun. Honestly, it was tolirable up until now, now it's just a limping horse that needs one final shot to the face."
YOU RUIND THE Team fortress 2 !!!!!
Valve has followed the prestigous 'Path of Doom' set by the9/Red5 Studios with the once great game Firefall: implement unweildly updates that NO ONE asked for and kill your game....  TF2=CS:GO Simulator.....  
Im bad at this game.
"It was fun, but updates ruined it. Now its impossible to just drop in a game with friends. Matchmaking is terrible. I may have to pay for overwatch. . . ."
"I just can't take it anymore. Casual mode is so so bad, matches are unbalanced if you start to loose your whole team starts to leave and then you play like 5 vs 10 or similar matches. I can't choose the map I want to play on. And I don't care about competative at all. At least you can still play community servers. I can't get myself to delete TF2 since I played for such a long time but this update is the worst thing that ever happened to TF2 and I lost any interest in playing. I will rather play Overwatch for now!!!"
TF2 before and after the Meet your match update:  Before: - Anyone could join a server really quick -There were free sandviches -There were friendlies -There were parties  After: -You have to wait in a queue just to join a single game -Removed quickplay (sadly) -If you are not a competitive type you have to play on community servers (WHICH THERE ARE A LOT OF ADS!)  I have to say the only thing good about this update is there is no autobalance anymore
"People need to understand that this is a HAT simulator, not a hate simulator."

Team Fortress 2 it game of good time  i play and my face look like = :)  if you play With a friend you will Find a Enjoyable time Give it a chance it Worth the experience.
"I have like 5 minutes on this game, pretty fun."
"Today i'm going to sit here and spend some hours on typing this sentence. My perspective about the game:   Man Vs Machine (MvM) : Well, you are a man. And you're fightning robots.. AMAZING ISN' IT?!, pretty much what the main thing is about MvM, is that you're gonna try protect some ♥♥♥♥ while some robots is running to it with a freaking bomb!!! If you're playing as Engineer, you got to watch out for the SENTRYBUSTER!! you can hear it by the name 'Sentry' (has something to do with a sentry) 'Buster' (hes gonna bust some ♥♥♥♥) now you know, hes gonna bust you're Sentry!  Co-Op : No theres no coop ♥♥♥ lmao ayy   Multiplayer: Holy ♥♥♥♥, you can finally stop insulting those poor robots, you're gonna be in a Team, (Blu Or Red) You're gonna fight against the other team and try capture a point, or a briefcase. (The briefcase has some secrect infomation about the enemy team) There are classes you can choose: Sniper, Soldier, Medic, Scout, Spy, Engineer, Heavy, Pyro, Demoman. Gonna go in futher infomation about those classes... (later)  About the classes (What can they do?) Sniper: Sniper is a good class for hiding and being a bit futher back, not pushing too much. He has a Sniper Rifle, SMG, and a Knife. You can change those weapons by getting drops or buying on Mann. Co store, Or even on Steam Market. There are also cosmetics you can add on you're characther. (Hats, Suits.. and such) That's for all of the classes.  Scout: Hes a good class for running, hes fast short and such. Like hes good for taking objects, but when it comes to fightning hes not the best opportunity for it. He has a Scattergun, Pistol, and a Baseball bat.  Demoman: Demoman is a good class for pushing, example... going and taking points, or objects. Hes not an fast class, good class for holding one point. He has a Grenade Launcher, Stickybomb Launcher, and a Bottle!  Spy: Hes a good class for sneaking behind people, he can go invisible by his Clock attachted to his arm. Example sap Engineer's Sentry, or sneaking thru the whole map and getting that briefcase, or capture a point! He has a Revolver, Sapper, Knife, Disguise kit.   Heavy: Hes a big guy with good amount of health, hes good for pushing and capturing points. Hes big and good for holding points! He has a Minigun, Shotgun, Fists.  Medic: Him and heavy is a good combination for rushing and capturing points or anything similiar. He has a Syringe Gun, Medi Gun, Bonesaw.  Engineer: Hes good for holding points and such, like camping one spot. Holding the briefcase in secure. He can build stuff, like Dispenser (Used for getting health &amp; ammo) Sentry (Used for killing enemies, very powerful) Teleporters (Your teammates can go from spawn to another place by spawning a Entrance and a Exit) He has a Shotgun, Pistol, Wrench.  I reccomend this game. -Viktor  I'm too lazy to write more...  Hope this was helpful    "
A game I adore. Valve keeps me coming back to this game non-stop. I've been playing since 2007 and still going strong. I REALLY reccomend it for the player who can go beyond a standard FPS.
"Why the hell are you looking at reviews? This game is free to play, just download it hahahaha."
RIP TF
"This is my first review since Steam debuted. I bought TF2 on release. The new competitive mode patch has made the game non-playable:  1. Team size is now six vs six. None of the maps are designed for six vs six. The maps feel empty.  2. The matchmaker does not work. Previously, I spent 30 sec searching for a game. Now, the matchmaker spends 20 min searching for a game. Regardless of causal or competitive.  3. You must reuse the matchmaker after two or three rounds, depending on game type. No just waiting for the server to start a new round. You get tossed out to find a new game.  4. Even in casual, things are competitive. For example, in attack / defend, you previously played until you won. Now, the second round of attack / defend can run no longer than the first or you lose.  5. Quite frankly, you spend longer searching for matches than you do playing. Previously, you traded 30 sec of searching for 5 - 50 min of gameplay. Now, you trade 20 min of searching for 5 - 10 min of gameplay before being kicked back to the matchmaker again.  6. In every casual / competitive game I play, folks leave. It turns into 4 vs 4 or 3 vs 3 without fail. No one joins to replace them. I had more games end from the enemy team leaving than actually beating them. Punishing people for leaving is not working.  7. I love king of the hill and payload race. In three days of trying, I have yet to find a single king of the hill or payload race match since the patch debuted. The matchmaker just times out after 30 min.  8. The matchmaker frequently crashes. So, you get booted back to the menu after a lackluster game only to find you cannot play anymore."
"Valve dun goofed with the latest update.  The competitive part is fine, but they changed Quickplay to Competitive Lite."
I can't even play the game let alone enjoy it because I can't even seem to open the menu to join casual or any mode
 The alternative world
"This game is epic, one of best multiplayer games ever :d you will absoluelty enjoy this ♥"
"Got my best laughs/moments with it. Although the game may be broken at this point after the 'Meet your Match' update, it will be going to its highest level from time to time."
One of the best games!
This game definately withstood the test of time.
"Through the years this game has jumped over my list of favourites reaching to one of my favourite games ever, it's so creative, so unique and full of cool things such as cosmetics, taunts, weapons making this not just a war game, but a game were you can have lots of fun doing innumerable things. And this game will be always 100% better than Overwatch."
"Team Fortress 2 is a game that has received a lot less support from Valve over the years, but, I really can't hate it, there's something about this game that I always come back too. To me, Team Fortress 2 has stood the test of time and is forever a legendary game to me."
"I've gotten over the Item sets being ♥♥♥♥ed over.  All in all, good game.  A fun class-based shooter where some classes you might not be good at, whereas others are perfect for you, in my opinion, you should definately give this a try, there are a multitude of Player-ran game modes, such as Dodgeball, Prophunt, and many others, the community is a really great community, though you should watch out for trade scams."
"  The game is very addicting, after playing for only 600+hours, I've found it extremely fun and entertaining. I Have made many friends off of Team Fortress 2 and it's still counting. You will not get bored of this game and it will keep you busy for a long time and you will always come back for more."
This is a great game fore people that enjoy realism. For example this is the only game know in which you can rocket jump and hats cost more than guns. Man! I wish this was real life.
"i enjoyed tf2 a lot i played this for hours and days but now the new update has screwed it over, like are you guys trying to make your game better then overwatch? srsly there is very terrible lag now i cant even play it and my pc has 4gb ram. please fix this a return old tf2"
A game worth your time!
"Great game, and community, it's a ton of fun f2p or p2p I just wish people would be less toxic towards new players."
I never get bored while playing this 10/10 :)
Stout Shako for 2 refiined!
"It was fun. It was enjoyable.   Then it was free, with purchasable items. And it all went horribly wrong.  Full of suspicious players, full of....STUPID items, and full of half-baked maps. It can be really fun for killing some time on a 20 player spammy server, but I'd rather stab my eyes out with spoons than try and play it competitively again.   Recommended as a ♥♥♥♥ about with your mates. Trying to play it more competitively will make your brain implode.   "
This game never gets old.
"I got TF2 last year some time and have been playing ever since. You may not think 100 hours is much but it is seen as tho i play so much Minecraft. Anyway, I would reccomend TF2 to anyone because it is a really fun 'Free to play game'. I found the tutorials on how to play very easy to understand, the tutorials consist of being a certain character and going through what weapons they have and what they do. Once gone through the tutorial i went on to mulitiplayer, The multiplayer of TF2 is faultless with Countless amount of servers to choose from all having different aims like capture the point or team death match etc. You may be thinking to get better weapons you will have to buy them in the store like in other games, well thats not the case as you find items while playing, which you can use or trade with others. Making it ideal for all gamers no matter there budget. Graphics side TF2 has decent graphics with a low to zero lag experience. If you like third person shooters TF2 is for you! 10/10!"
Funny stuff Free to play Unique visual aesthetic Online Balanced classes Pyro  Do you recommend this game? Yes.
TF2! Awseome game overall. A firstperson cartoon shooterwith its funny moments and Its competative asspects. GREAT GAME
play this
"Awesome, this game is the best F2P shooter ever"
ruined my life 10/10
I play this game because I have no life and it's free (if you're a gibus). Another reason is because I like clothes and wearing them digitally makes me feel better about myself.
"TF2 is an awesome FPS with very well thought out characters, balanced gameplay, and best of all: hats! (Not really but trading is fun if you're looking for something new). I'd recommend it to any gamer who loves shooters and goofy animation."
"THE BEST FRICKIN' GAME EVER!!! Yes of course Best game ever, Prepare for your best moments with the game, takes place in the 2nd world war. An awesome hat simulator. And also a nice ''crate opening'' thing, perfect to rage sometimes :D"
This game is best game ever.
"Team Fortress 2 is, at heart, a gloriously simple game that's been created with style, panache and an undeniable love of gaming. It's the kind of game that you want to show to people who don't play games so that they understand and then either get involved or go away. There is life before Team Fortress 2, and there is life after. After is better. The action is fast-paced and furious, the game's presentation is hilarious and exciting and the gameplay is very easily approachable. Experiment with a few classes or stick with one, but do anything to get your hands on TF2. It'll be an online experience you won't forget."
This game is the very reason I took up aerobic in real life.
Very good game!
"  Great free to play alround shooter, with a really funny cartoony style looking game"
i woul recomend the game if you are older then 10 
Now it's imposible to find a game. Awful.
"Actually I really really love this game..In fact I am just ready to pratise how to be not a noob in this game, while too many players try very hard to type 'noob down' all the round. But that won't stop me playing TF2. Cauz' I really love the idea of playing freely, and enjoy all the killing and being killed. hahaha But what recently have updated confused me a lot..why adding competive games into it..Now I can't even play in a server as happy as I could previously. What's more, now we cannot vote, and team-balance system ,which makes me feel a little bit unhappy, now makes me sick..yep, I am noob, but now I don't wanna practise anymore."
They ruined the game with the new update.Cant get into a casual game and if you somehow manage to get in and leave you get a cooldown on casual and not to mention that you cant even choose a map you wanna play.The new update sucks  so I am just gonna stop playing until they revert it back to the way it was.♥♥♥♥ YOU VALVE ♥♥♥♥ YOU GABEN im gonna go buy overwatch at least blizzard listens to their community.
"The old Tf2 I loved so much is gone now from this. Reduced over the years by dissapointing updates that removed more and more things I found fun about the game. I would have recommended this for sure years ago, but new updates and changes are, simplying putting it, not fun."
To this point about tf2 I've just compelety gave up on this game when the first time I ever got this game since it was a Pay 2 Play game it was really quite enjoyable and around the time the community was calm and peaceful well before valve start adding hats and just csgo leveling systems and just other useless items that doesnt do jack ♥♥♥♥ to your stats ingame at all along with tf2 gun reskins that isnt a orignal idea from valve themselfs well I dont want to ♥♥♥♥ on this game but to be honest I love this game before it became a F2P. Well thats a huge mistake now the community is toxic with just so many stuck up people also lets not forget how valve had recently made pyro OP on the recent update or just nerf weapons that didn't needed to be nerfed at all the thing is valve is just shooting their self in the foot. go get overwatch or something idk this is my opionion I guess. 
"Yes I recommend this game. TF2 is pretty good and it's free.   If you're on Steam and you don't have it, get it now."
"This game has been a blast from its action-packed gameplay to its unique in-game economy. This is the #1 game I play all the time. It is a great title and fun for everyone. Including the kids. I mean you combine a free fun game, with pyrovision goggles you get a great time for the kiddies. On the other hand for more mature people, there is its own economy. I have had so much fun exploring the economy in this game and I think its just great. Including the various different sites. Yet with its economy there are also sharkers, scammers, and phishers. People who try to steal whats rightfully ours. My first initial reaction to this game was it was just a stupid cartoon shooter. Now I think its the best game I have ever played and I shouldn't have judged this great game by its cover. Its fun for everyone, it is unique in its own ways, and it is probably the funnest game I've ever played on my PC. I recommend this game for everyone and all who enjoys a great game."
"A really dumb FPS focused around hats, sandviches and conga-lines. I highly recommend it.  (In all seriousness though I had never played a FPS before TF2, they all seemed boring, dull and over-competitive. TF2 is not like that. All the classes are hilarious and full of character, it has a thriving and friendly community, and there are weapons suited to every play style. No class is better than another. Everyone should give it a go if you haven't already.)"
The New update was Fricking Suck
it really need a motivation?
"After playing 1000+ Hours, I might do a re-write of the re-write of my review  Stage 1: Graphics  Everyone knows the cartoony graphics of Team Fortress 2, IMO, the change from a Realistic Shooter that Team Fortress 2 was supposed to be, was a good idea. The graphics are amazing, HD and no lag when at high, hopefully, TF3 (If they actually do make one) has the same graphics from the current game that everyone loves.  Rating: 10/10 - Beautiful Art Design  Stage 2: Gameplay and Mechanics  In the usual FPS, its simple, WASD to move and Mouse 1 to shoot and kill everyone to win. Well, in TF2 its much different, Custom Weapons that allow whole new styles to play, Gamemodes that never get old (Especially Payload and Control Points) and the creative maps, no map is the same except for its gameplay mechanics. One problem I have with this is, they don't have a filter that allows premium players who have higher skill than free to players, this causes unbalance in some teams when a team where its mostly free to players and and other team where its highly skilled players always destroy the other team. As well as the auto balance, it makes people who are about to win then BAM! the player is now on the losing team.  But overall, the mechanics of the game may have little downsides but never stop people from enjoying the gameplay and different weapons.  Rating: 8.5/10 Close to amazing  Final Stage: Community, Updates and Content  First, I'll start with the community, the TF2 Community is amazing, a lot of faithful players who love this game to the very end, but it has some flaws, free to players, These people are so stupid, these players can't even listen to direction, I've tried coaching and it sucks so much, they don't listen to you at all and clueless to what is happening. Second, Premium, those people are mean, in trading they force you to pay more than what its worth, they should add rules to trading, chatting and other things that can effect new players. I hope those who are mean, become good and help those who are new and change the way they play.  Second, Updates, the updates are lacking very lacking, Valve step it up, after some updates, TF2 is losing their community I mean the EotL was overhyped, there was supposed to be new weapons and a new map then Valve says 'the map was too confusing for new players' how about rd_asteroid? Even players who played for a long time don't get cp_steel. Basically, step it up Valve.  Finally, Content, there is A LOT of content in this game, mostly hats. They should focus more on weapons than hats. That covers most of that but now, gamemodes, no new game modes for a long time, except for Mann Power but recent players of the Gamemode think its bad. Valve is focusing on hats and bugs.   Rating 1: 9/10\ Rating 2: 4/10 Overall:7.1/10 Need a bit of work Rating 3: 7/10/   Overall Rating: 8.6/10 - Amazing Game"
"This game might be my favourite F2P game. I hate Pay to Win games, maybe TF2 includes items that causes imbalance play, but you can drop most of the items by playing if I'm not wrong, and it oddly felt balanced. And it has a really fun gameplay and teamplay, cartoonish graphics, characters that everybody knows, classes that everyone can pick one for their taste. Just give it a try, you won't regret it.  It's a Valve game after all."
Has a lot to offer and has way more replay value compared to other games I don't get bored with it 10/10
Killed by a flying american psychopath with a garden shovel. 10/10 would die again.
"a fun multiplayer game with lots of different classes, such as a Sniper, Demoman, Soldier, and even a Spy! this game brings both comedy and action together, with the characters being able to say funny things as they kill their enemies. and with unlocks of special tools and clothing, you can customize your character, making his as snazzy or as bad-tasting as you want. also with the training option, you can prepare yourself for battle, going up against one of the most easiest-to-beat types of enemies in video game history, BOTS!!! so give this game a try and get all the thrills, spills and chills that Team Fortress 2 has to offer, FOR FREE!!!"
"Incredibley fun game, lots of maps, guns, armour/clothing, melee weapons and more goodies."
"Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is the sequel to the game that put class-based, multiplayer team warfare on the map. TF2 delivers new gametypes, a signature art style powered by Valve’s next generation animation technology, persistent player statistics, and more. Unlike other 'class-based' games that offer a variety of combat classes only, Team Fortress 2 packs a wild variety of classes which provide a broad range of tactical abilities and personalities, and lend themselves to a variety of player skills. Play as the flame-throwing Pyro, the room clearing Heavy, or the Spy, a master of disguises. Other classes include: Scout, Sniper, Medic, Engineer, Demoman, or Soldier. TF2 features the most advanced graphics of any Source-based game released to date – and the most exciting class-based action ever created."
"The ideal online shooter: average player can enter the fray and even hurt somebody, while pros will be grinding away milliseconds from the time to carry the suitcase on 2forts. And all thanks to the fact that among the nine classes there is exactly zero useless ones. The only serious drawback is the disgracefully low number of maps."
ok TeamFortress 2 (aka TF2) is a really fun game. a TON of cool weapons you can find and buy... i would recommrnd this game to any FPS player...
"great job valve , thnx lord gaben for that ,"
NIce Game :)
This is a fun-action packed game ment for those who love to shoot things in creative ways.
Low minimum standards for your pc with a huge online community. So many servers to pick from. Value for money is therefore over the top.  This game should be in your inventory.
An awesome game to play :)
this game is NOT free if you want hats.  and you want hats.  7/11
"soooo, long story short, i played this game 4 like 2yrs, went to the hospital and pretty much died (a couple of times) had comas, strokes, siezures, everything that should've made me a vegatable ( and did for like 10days ) stayed stuck in the hospital for like 6mnths (maybe7) miraculously came thru the veil and woke up. I had to learn how to walk again and learn who my friends and family were again. Naturally, when i got out and couldn't remember passwords to anything (emails, steam, my laptop, nothin') betchyer ♥♥♥ i still d/l'ed TF2 the second i got my new laptop, all i can do is gaze upon my former glory thru my old crew profile i managed to rejoin but im still ballin' (still lampin') and still enjoying EVERY ♥♥♥♥ING MINUTE of Team4tress. i love you guys. (were hatz ALWAYS this cool!?) :D"
This game has a little bit of everything humor guns FLAMETHROWERS radioactive drinks hats birds snoipahs BLOODY SPOIS knives stealth austrailians comics disguises bombs on rail tracks EXPLOSIONS etc...
I have not played it that much but i think it's about hats or something...
♥♥♥♥ you valve you ♥♥♥♥♥ fix this ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ matchmaking system or i'm going to bomb a ♥♥♥♥ing postal office
"A nice war game, every time a upgrade comes it becomes better! Free to play, download it now! You can buy dlc premium account"
"Sooo, yeah. I have over 200 hours. And my inventory is full of stuff. And I did recommend this game (BEFORE) a recent update. The update completely ruined the game for me, and thousands of others. You may no longer join a game if you leave until the game you were in is done, official valve servers have been removed, there is now a wait time to get into servers. You can no longer choose the map, or specific gamemode. There are limitations to choosing the gamemode. THE SPYS SPEED WAS INCREASED.... Now, will I continue to play the game? Maybe yes. It has been my favorite FPS and it most likely always will be. Do I recommend the game in the current state? Sadly, no. But I do believe the game still has potential."
The only game were your hat deserves its own hat  and your hat's hat deserves its on hat
"the best game i have ever played. 12/10, never before did i think i would enjoy owning a hat worth more than my halftop. best way to lose all your disposable income, great gameplay, great community, great game"
"At first I thought it was some cartoony fps. But now Valve proved me wrong. TF2 is a great game, very addicting, and a great place to make money."
Good hat simulator 10/10 would get phishing links again.
"EDIT: After a loooooong time,I decided to edit my review,because it was not enough for this amazing game,so,let's get started!  THE SHORT REVIEW IS AT THE BOTTOM  LONG VERSION"
pretty good i think
ITS A REAL FUN :D
"Trust me when you get the game you say to yourself screw spending money on stuff, Next thing you know BAM over 100$ spent. Fun wise I give it a 11/10"
"Alright, first review I've ever done, so ignore incorrect spelling if you can.  Right! So off the bat, I adored the art style and the gameplay, but... The gameplay was way overwhelming for me at first. The good thing is that I wanted to join in, be more of a team player, so, I started playing more to gain more experience in how to basically, as some might say 'Get good' at this game.  Its really enjoyable, and with updates every now and then, it stays fresh, fun and the community are always welcome. I'd say that this game, is the one that everyone should have a go at, and if its your kinda cake, then pick up a slice, place it next to your sandvich, and get your lunchbox to the battle field and place a dispenser here! Its go time!"
"One of the smartest FPS games out there. Has a lot of potential to always be fresh with updates. MvM is a brilliant game-mode.  As long as the support from valve is there, this game can remain popular for a very long time."
It's a good game.
10/10 would play again.
First time playing and I was like 'Holy moly!' This game is different than most FPS games because of it's gimmicks of actions (character design/items) and wide range of classes. It's a game that all ages can enjoy and play.   Still learning how to play and it can get frustating because you don't know what's going on but that's how it is for every game. You play for the fun and have fun!   Really fun when you know what's going on! Have a blast guys!
"A game that redifines your average FPS like COD or Medal of Honor. Its actually fun to play, the game is balanced, and you don't even have to pay to play. The characters have amazing qualities and personalities. The game is filled with different weapons AND A BOAT LOAD OF HATS!"
One of my favorite games. Has a lot if hats. 10/10.
I like this game
"Valve ♥♥♥♥ing killed this, once awesome and great, game  It seems like the developers have gotten scared by the competetive scene in Overwatch (Blizzards new fps game) and now they want to do the same - but for a game where you've been able to jump into a hub with no real commitment, this update has officially made this game a much much worse version of the Blizzard game...  So sad to see my all-time favorite game decline like this, but i guess everything has its end."
"I left the game running at night, I swear.  11/10"
"Shout out to ArraySeven for saying that this is 'The Casual Tragedy.' Also, TF2 copied CS:GO (don't get triggered)"
Pretty nice game keep up the good work valve :D
"Alright. Personally, this game means alot to me. This is actually the first game I ever downloaded to steam and I've had SO many good memories with friends and strangers playing this game. But even against all the good memories I've had, they're not all positive. Infact, these are the worst 2 I can remember right now.  1. hackers  Not as relavent anymore but still watch out for them, the VAC system isnt flawless so these people just want to ruin your day.  2. toxic community members  Now this one is not that bad, but tf2 has the reputation of having some of the WORST community members ever. Not as bad as CS:GO's but still, pretty toxic. These people made me stay away from the community for a while fearing that they would make fun of me and stuff.  Even with all these flaws, tf2 is still a great game. Even though i only have around a year on steam, I've clocked in almost 1300 into this game. And I plan to put in many more. TF2 is a very casual game. Now I get alot of stress coming home from school and sometimes going on tf2 and just having a good time can relieve most of my stress, even put me in a good mood. Despite all the 'tf2 is dying' statements, that is not true at all. TF2 still has a large enough fanbase where it won't just die out that simply. And also, it's a free to play game, which means lot's of new players that don't want to spend money on steam will want to get this game simply just because its free.  I strongly recomend this game to anyone that just wants to have a good time playing a game "
"If you're new to PC gaming, play this game. If you've been playing PC for a long time, play this game. If you haven't played this game.... play this game."
I thouroghly enjoy the games characters and also the ability of using servers for trade and/or achievments. This game is very good at keeping me entertained and interested for any new updates that might happen. I fully recommend this game.
A game every PC gamer has to try.   It's a classic and it will be for a while.
best free game on steam 10/10
"Valve has gone and utterly destroyed this game. I used to love playing it, and now it's become an Overwatch wannabe. Honestly, all I can say is go play BattleBorn, it's better than what TF2 has become."
"A wonderfully balanced game that delievers well to both veterans of FPS' and newcomers with its charming art-style, addicting gameplay, wonderful characters and in-depth features."
"Absolutely amazing, fun, and entertaining, though it is a bit rough on most computers."
"I got this game after it became free, so I read the reviews and there was nothing but hats there, so I didn't bother. Then one day when bored I said fine i'll play and since that day I haven't seen daylight."
Hats/10 Like Hat economy simulator with FPS minigame
The new matchmaking update isn't fun to play
"BEST PC GAME EVER CREATED,however i really hope valve makes the falsely announced new class (the guard dog). the gameplay with that class would revolutionize tf2 and pc gaming forever."
"I Highly recommend this game if your a new comer to steam, if you like teambased games this is the game for you :D  It has a REALLY good community,Tons of updates that give it Alot of love....  The only bad thing they added was something from Cs:go...Tickets. Paying 5-6+ Dollers for a tickets to earn 15+ cents on market and Level up the badge which is totally useless is a Ripoff...   Thats all i got to say about the game and Have FUN! :D"
"A fun game when you get into a good server, which is not hard. Multiple classes makes it easy to find something you enjoy playing, and the amount of items alloted to you are immense and ever-expanding."
 Team Fortress 2.
"I wasted over 1000 hours on this game, and it stole my life from me. and I have to say. I love this game to death. I see new players every day, and think back when I was Free 2 play. it doesn't really matter about hats. but skills."
This is interesting GaMe!!! whooo hoooo!
"Probably the best game ever, I have met so many people here and said so many weird stuff on this game that I can't even imagine my self before playing tf2 O-O"
"Donkey Balls  Ugggh, the new casual update sucks donkey balls. for the casual player, haven't played in 5 months, this blows. takes way to frakin long to get into a game."
Awesome game but I think I enjoy the trading side of it more than the playing side.
"Of all the 300 odd games I have, I've played this one more than all the others combined (as of 7/2013), which says a lot about this game's quality and replayability. In my opinion it's one of the best tycoon games ever, as you work your way up the ladder of hats and unusuals, but instead of earning money proportional to the quality and quantity of your hats, you have to play a cute FPS minigame to earn basic items, that you can use to trade your way up to more hats. This is an interesting take on the tycoon formula, but puts more focus on economy and trading, and obviously works well for this game.  10/10, would wear hats again."
Just started playing PC. I have 80 games. I keep going back to this.
Oh how the mighty have fallen... My (Former) Favorite game of all time was just murdered brutaly trying to compete with overwatch... two weeks ago I was in a discussion with people in which I was the only one who liked tf2 more than overwatch because I loved its charm and you had to kill that with casual play. I have not been this disappointed over a game update...ever. I would have prefered for you to shut down your servers than to end up as this...thing
Has a greatly immersive campaign  10/10
"This used to be the best way to end a long day for me. Now it's completely competetive, not just partially like everyone thought it would be. I used to be able to go straight to a map that I wanted in notime without going through that gray, half-life based search box. Now you're ranked in casual. I used to love how TF2 was just about having fun and nobody cared about winning as opposed to CSGO. This is no longer possible. It takes so long to search for a map, too.  Team Fortress 2 is a great game, truly. One of the best.   Make Team Fortress 2 Great Again."
this is probably the best first person shooter I've ever played sometimes I forget that this is rated M with its cartoonish details this is great!!
Fun game if you look past all the broken stuff.
"Seriously, what the ♥♥♥♥?  I liked to play this game just to ♥♥♥♥ around and have fun, but this update made the game un-playable and time consuming. Valve doesn't even try anymore for tf2. Makes sense due to it being an 8 year old game."
i've excused 10 crappy updates. no more. valve! you made it clear that you hate me.
The new update sucks ♥♥♥
"TF2 is DEAD TO ME. I had hopes for when the Pyro vs Heavy Update was released. I thought they would realize, 'hey, players are leaving, maybe we should change a few things to get about 90% of TF2 players back.' I was wrong. Ive played TF2 for 3 years, and I thought it would never come to this. But I HATE TF2 AND VALVE. VALVE, IF YOU ARE READING THIS, I HOPE TO GOD YOU START COMMUNICATING WITH THE COMMUNITY MORE. BECAUSE YOU HAVE JUST LOST ME AND 90% OF ALL TF2 PLAYERS TO OVERWATCH. This game, this game is trash now. None of the gameplay is fun anymore, they removed the reason 90% of all TF2 players play TF2, which is the option to play whatever map and gamemode you want. Thats not even the worst part. THEY ARE COPYING OVERWATCH WITH THEIR COMPETATIVE MODE. WHAT THE HELL VALVE!!! TF2 IS MEANT TO BE A NON-COMPETATIVE GAME. ITS MEANT TO BE A GAME WHERE YOU HAVE FUN AND CHOOSE WHATEVER MAP YOU WANT, PLAY HOWEVER YOU WANT, AND HAVE FUN. Now, that aspect is gone. I can not emphasise this more. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. Go play Overwatch instead, because Blizzard knows what they are doing."
Is a review even necessary?
Very great game!
"Tf2 Is An Amazing FPS Game, It Has Many Different Type of Game Mode, And It Has An Excellent Animation, And Its Completely Free 2 Play"
"This game is fantastic and is sure to be around for a great deal of time. With the different classes and the variety of equipment to get, anyone will be able to play this on hours on end!"
"9 different classes with their own distinct lines, personality, and specialization. 230+ weapons with their own upgrades and downgrades. Over 350 different items to customize with. Frequent updates, an active community, a company that listens, and extremely enjoyable for anyone."
this game is crazzy fun. hilarious and amazing 
10/10 would hat again
Fortress of Teams Twice is a game that makes me more concerned about virtual hats then real life events. I think this makes it worthy enough to be in anybody's Steam Library.
Until they make valve drop in and out servers and quickplay a thing again i cannot play this game anymore
"Honestly, I cannot find any avid gamer that is on steam and does not play Team Fortress 2. It's almost sacriligious to even have steam installed without also having TF2, as it's called by the players, on at least one computer capable of running it well, and boy is that not surprising. This game literally eats up time like no other (except maybe Dota 2 for some, or call of duty for others), and to be honest, the community is just as great. I can easily find a server where nobody gives a crap about killing as many other players as possible, or I can join one with an internationally recognised player for their prowess or two. The amount of hats too! it's all mind boggling that there are still gamers out there that haven't found TF2 enjoyable or have not even heard of it in general. What else to talk about...oh, the support. Obviously, due to its enourmous fanbase and it's publisher being the great and powerful Gaben (Steam creater and CEO(?)), it will almost always be there, as even Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is still supported and given server-space on top of all the newer games. Anyways, I highly recommend this game, and the game in summary would have to be: Hat Simulator 2014 :3 Happy Hat hunting my friends! I hope to see you in-game."
"This game ruined over 1,800 hours of my life. LOVE IT"
"possibly one of the best dress 'em up games on the market. great variety in costumes; my Demoman in particular wearing those shutter shades and a cool beanie, and my Pyro looking super-threatening in a skull and bones get-up.  it's a shame you spend most of the game shooting each other"
"very nice game, fun and engaging! nice economy system, server almost full all the time and good trading system!"
It's free.
Best Game Ever. Has great People if you find the right servers. Will last forever.
"Though I'm for the most part only into realistic shooters, TF2 is too fun to pass up. It's free to play now so there's no reason not to! ^_^"
The most amazing f2p I have ever experienced. Balanced gameplay across all 9 classes. Hats.
"289 hours and counting. Save yourselves, or collect the hats. This is what it truly comes down to. There is no going back after this."
it is awsome
i bought tf2 when it was in beta or alpha and i would say 100% it was not worth like the 4.99 trust me its worth alot more than 4.99 a amazing game! i wuv it!
"It's a awesome and addicting First person shooter game, it can take some time to learn, but it's really worth a try :)"
The New update ruined I can't join any servers only community
This game is one of the best fps games ever in my opinion
"A colourful, fun game for anyone who likes FPS and video games in general."
"Team Fortress 2 is one of my most favorite First Person Shooter Games that I have played so far. It offers a unique playstyle for all 9 classes. Each of them come in different shapes and sizes, along with a aresonal of weapons and personalities. The game is also incredible because with new updates and items like cosmetics coming in, it also offers a unique playstyle. Unlike most First Person Shooter games where everyone has pretty much the same weaponry, in this game, you don't. Each class has their strength and weaknesses, which makes this game more challenging and unique, thus making it more fun for players. If I had to rate this game, I would honestly give it a 9.4 out of 10."
"Used to be the best f2p online multiplayer fps ever. Not so much anymore..  Don't get me wrong, it's still one of my favourite games. My computer is so old I can't play Overwatch.  + Will be fun if the god's are in your favour + Free-to-play + Hats - Cheap design. I've always wanted to see that there are over 5000 matching games ongoing, and I still have to wait 5-10min to get into one. Not. It's mann vs. machine design copypasted to the 'new update'. - Competitive mode is pretty much waste of time. You might have to wait for 10min to get into game, play it for +30min and right before your team wins the round/match, one guy leaves the game from the opposite team. That means you get precisely 0 experience from the whole match... All the time went to waste. Oh and what does the guy get for a penalty for leaving? 30min bathroom break. Thanks volvo. - Can't browse valve servers from the server list anymore, instead you have to get into line and wait for some time - Wait 5-10 minutes to get into game, system puts you into server which is literally over 4000 km away. Finnish player gets put into Dubai server: Ping 250..  10 minuses comes from this incident I recently had, personal rant: I have phone number added to steam and like many others who has this many hours in the game, I aswell am premium account. After a few days when the update came I tried to play it but couldn't. Casual was only which was working, so I thought Competitive is not free to play. I bought the ticket, and miraculously competitive mode started working.. A couple of days ago I happened to read the FAQ, and it says pretty clearly that comp is aswell free-to-play if you meet the requirements, which I do. So I went to ask for an refund and did I get it? No. I don't 'qualify for a refund' (I believe it's because there has been more than 48 hours since I bought it). I bought the most useless thing you could, spent over 7€ for it, and can't get refund. There it is, sitting on my inventory totally unharmed. Not tradeable, not marketable. Sure, it's partly my fault for not reading the game FAQ earlier but really.. What bug there was which made me buy the ticket -I don't need- to play the free-to-play update?   Did Valve scam me for +7€? That's how it feels right now, and that's the reason I can't recommend this game.   If and when Valve fixes the game completely, I will probably write a new review. Eventho it's pretty clear I don't see that 7€ ever again."
I don't think it needs review.
i liked this game before but because of the new update i has gone so down hill
It is the greatest game i ever played. What describes tf2 the most : fun teamwork. I recommend this game to everyone who want to relax and have some fun time at the same time.
This Game was good but the new update has ruined it good job valve
want a casual fps without people screaming at you on mic? want to hear thai kids cry? play it
"this game is awesome it is a firstperson shooter and has accessories like hats and weapons.This game also has gamemodes like man vs machine,capture the flag,arena,and control points."
game is a very good and well made
"You've heard a lot of noise about this game - people who love it, people who loathe it. People who thought it died five years ago, and are confused about why they haven't received invitations to the wake. Here's some news for those of you who've been hiding under rocks for five years - Team Fortress 2 is still played, it's still great, and it's still totally free!  I don't think Team Fortress 2 is the best game ever made - but it's got just the right combination of awesome monetisation model, flexible gameplay and moddability that you could arguably play TF2, more TF2 and nothing but TF2, and never actually run out of things to do. Furthermore, the game can run on a toaster or a beast, and get the best out of both.   It would be disingenuous of me to pretend the game's got nothing wrong with it. The game balance tends to shift a fair bit after every major update - usually to the chagrin of a large number of very, very, very noisy teenagers. Why are they so very, very, very noisy? Probably because they care about the game that much.   And you should too. &gt;:)"
"After long hours of gameplay in Team Fortress 2, and after playing every single mode in the game (except a few mods), I guess it's time to do the review! :3  The game is very unique. In everything. It's not everyday you see a game which you have to choose between 9 different classes, with unique abilities for steal out some kills. It's not everyday you find a game with crazy guys hired to kill each other, just because silly brothers. It's not everyday you see the both silly brothers being killed by their lost brother and then starting a war for get the company. It's not everyday you find out a game where you have to kill a lot of hordes of robots made by the crazy lost brother.  ...Seriously, TF2 has even story behind the mercenaries protecting briefcases, pushing giant bombs and capturing points. Also fighting not-so-smart robots. It's not only about the hats (actualy), it's the gameplay! It's not the same thing in comparison with others FPS's. Entering even more inside the game, you can discover more random stuff, like the in-game fads. That's what attract more players, in my opinion.  And for being a F2P game, everyone can enjoy the randomness of Teufort! And don't think the F2Players will only noob: some Gibus guys will dance over your corpse in-game. I'm being serious.  Curious now? :D Get the game. Doesn't have space in the computer? At least get some 'culture' of the game. Don't know where to start? Watch all the 'Meet the Team', pay a visit to the TF2 Official Wiki and check out the most famous TF2 fads. Two famous ones are Demopan and Painis Cupcake. ;D Meet ya around Teufort!"
"ok so the new update huh?   I waited 45 minutes to play a random game mode i dont even wanted to play but i had to choose because you cant even play the maps you want because ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, after i waited 45 MINUTES i ended up on an hong kong server (im from europe) not realy able to leave the spawn i decided to leave the server only to find out i cant play again because i left a !CASUAL MATCH!.  the next 'little' problem is that the item servers are nearly ALWAYS down because again ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.  so please valve STOP ♥♥♥♥ing UP THE GAME it was realy good, ok i didnt like the tough brake but it was acceptable but this is just WTF.  thanks for reading Bonsai"
"If you're like to customize your character with cosmetics over actually playing the game, this is the game for you."
join public games only to be called a hacker when you anally savage little kids that don't read the official wiki and do their research or join autistic servers where killing is apparently dis-allowed in a team based shooting game.
It's one of the best multiplayer game i had play
The recent update ruined tf2 goodbye.
TF2&gt;Every FPS shooter that exists.
"Since the recent match making update, you have to wait a good 15 minutes before actually entering a match on 'casual' mode. Once the match is over (keep in mind a match can last as little as 10 mintues sometimes) you're forced to find a new game. The matchmaking takes longer than the actual game with recent experience, so i honestly can't recomend this game while it's like this, as even community servers force ads on you"
"Team Fortress 2 is or rather was a great game whtch I never thought I'd say untill the most recent updates it's just gone to ruins. It takes ages to find a game, you can't join a game that your friend is already in with out them leaving and creating a party and to be honest the list goes on. I mean this is just my opinion and don't let this put you off getting this game. The gameplay though once you find a game is fun and action packed so don't take my word for it make your own mind up about it."
"Dear valve you done ♥♥♥♥ed up. this new update has destroyed tf2 for me and my friends. We no longer find the game fun to play just plain boring. Team fortess was once a fun game, that had a smart and quick way of getting into servers. Now after this new update. The game is just ♥♥♥♥. Before the update the game was like: wait 30 seconds server found and play.  Now the game goes like: get into a lobby,invite friends, wait 10 minutes to find a match, play for 5 minutes,match done and then you can go ahead and repeat.  I don't know if this sound fun to you but it really isn't.  So i am begging you please. Give us quickplay back and please just give the us, the players the old Team fortress back. The game that we loved and not this waiting simulator."
One of the best games i've ever played in my life. 7 years later the game is still a masterpiece for many.  10/10
Great Game. Free too!!!! Lots of fun.. never boring
"If this isn't the most popular free game out there then i don't know WHAT is! Team Fortress 2 is endless fun, with nine unique character classes and huge loads of collectible items for each! I have a few dozen hours on it and I am nowhere NEAR tired of it! try it out, I believe you will love it as I do!"
ASWUM GAME!!! 11/10
"Normally, I hate FPS'. I prefer to have my characters in front of me instead of looking through their eyes. However, this game is a BIG exception to the rule. I have a genuine blast when I play the game. It's silly and goofy, and the combat system's cool too! I definitely recommend this game. :)"
great game
This game is cool and Funny :) More people play this game! I like places and arms :)   If you want a Action Funny Game i Recommend Team Fortress 2 (y)  By:#CRISTIAN1ELITE
Good game :3 im already having fun :3
"More often than not, I hate this game with a burning passion. BUT IT HAS HATS 10/10"
"Hi  While I can't say I have clocked many hours with this game since I only just started playing I will say that I WAS having fun, I am a pretty casual gamer and after perusing the Community servers since most either only have the same map 24/7 or have ads etc etc and not really finding anything I like I tried multiplayer/quickplay and instantly fell in love with Attack/defense.   I was getting the hang of a few classes and loved looking forward to coming home from work to unwind with it, The map's rotated every now and then which freshened the matches and players could come and go as they pleased resulting in some challenging, some easy going and some downright FUN matches.... Then the update came.... now don't get me wrong I actually think that competitive is a great idea FOR THOSE THAT WANT TO PLAY IT! But removing the quickplay option to replace it with casual? Bad move.... I know Valve are working to fix some of the issues with it but personally my new experiance is this..  .Get into a game .Spend half that game dead due to cheaters/hackers. .Get disconnected after each match and have to q all over again (not so bad now since the wait time seems to have severally dropped but still annoying. .Get annoyed with the pressure and stress of a match and go play something else.  Casual should be just that casual. But it even annouces at the beginning of a 'casual match' PREPARE TO COMPETE! To me the new 'casual feature' just seems like a watered down version of competitive mode. It was much more fun as quickplay, I dont care about levels, I dont care about ranking up. I just want to play for fun!  So would I recommend this game? A few days ago I would have said absoutly, it was fun, and full of imaginative and quirky characters. Now though? I would not recommened unless you like playing competitively because thats pretty much all you can do.  Please valve give us back quickplay!"
"Great game, and to think its FREE TO PLAY"
 Team Fortress 2 Review
It's alright.
"This game is ok, I guess"
"Hi 5'ed team member just as gates opened. Rushed out, f2p scout tried to shoot us with scattergun and missed every time. Dead. Capped point. F2p heavy opened fire. Spy stabbed him. Dead. On the way out, F2p medic tried to shoot us with the Medi Gun. Dead. Won game, never saw a single sentry from f2p engineer. Found him trying to shoot us in victory time. Dead.  Met a guy with several Australium weapons. Played a game with him. Never moved an inch and flooded chat with trade alerts.  10/10 lovely community"
"If you own steam, you own this game, you have no reason not to play it. One of the best games I've ever played, and it's only getting better.  "
One of the best games ever.
Got a flamethrower.   Named it Muffins.  Got a better flamethrower.  Sold Muffins.  Named new weapon Cupcakes.  I'm killing people with Cupcakes.
Great Game! Although i feel like i wasted to many hours and dollars on hats!
After I played this game 700h i can totally say its one of the best Games on Steam.You can buy Items from the official Valve Store (Man Co) or from the Community Market but the rest of the game is free.You can find items too but there is an weekly limit. The game is simple with good claases and many modes. Its easy to play and you have a lot of fun.
" Hats.   A free-to-play first-person shooter with lots of content and a unique art style.  Nine classes, each of which plays and feels differently. A lot of game modes to play, with the community-developed ones further increasing the amount. Hundreds and hundreds of both cosmetic and useful items to craft, and then never get the chance to trade them because Valve has successfully killed trading. At least the game is generally very easy to jump into."
"Its super fun game with a magic gameplay you never be tired of, because of vast variety of maps and classes game never get old and boring, can't say much more, ITS Absolutly fascinating."

this game ftw 
"I like how I can play and dominate players, everything's cool and awesome! But the only problem is the Ping, I'm surprised I still play it with my Ping at 524 -.- Valve please fix it!"
I played this game for a few minutes and can say that it's really good War-Hat-Taunt simulator. All glory to the Hypno Toad.
I only played a little bit but it was fun.
"Would not recommend if you're one for getting addicted easily to something. Would recommend no matter what, contradicting my last statement."
"I love this game , its fun too play , i wish there was more games like this &lt;3"
Lost my girlfriend.  havent left my house in 3 years.  spent over 1000 dollars on hats.  ruined my life.  10/10 l came 
I have had so much fin in this game i recomend anyone to try it
Probably the only game where skill doesn't matter as long as you have a backpack full of fancy hats to show off.
People kept killing me idk what i'm doing but i got some hats so it all worked out okay  10/10 waste hundreds of hours of your life
Ruined my life.  10/10 would reccomend
"My parents, friends and even doctors all laughed when i said i wanted to devote my time to collecting hats and throwing ♥♥♥♥ at people. But this made it possible. Hat simulator 2 is the best hat simulator i've played in my life, not only does it have beautiful hats but you can also fight people and show off your hats. 10/10 oh, and it has guns"
Something cod players hate! You'll be the envy of all your quick scoping friends! But if you're f2p you'll probably suck. 'No matter who you are if you're a f2p you're going to suck' - IGN
"I gotta say... this game is worth most of your time playing. With the art style, the humor, and all the creative weapons, I highly recommend this game"
"If you don't own this game now, WHAT THE BLOODY HELL ARE YOU WAITING FOR?! I've sunk my entire day into this MONSTER of a game, I say it's damn well worth a Download. After all, Sense it's FTP from now on, You too can try it for yourself."
This game never fails to leave you bored and si always full of action and exitement the only real downside is ummmm ill have to think of that but this game is awesome!!!
"One of the best multiplayer FPS game out there !! This game has a ton of items , hats ,costumes and more . This is a good game to play with friends especialy MvM (mann vs machine) I recomend this game to people who like to play with friends and those who like fps games. There are many more reasons why this game is a 9/10! Try it becouse ITS FREE!!"
This game is so awesome! Everything about it is just great! Everyone should give it a try.
"This isn't Team Fortress 2.  This is Hat Fortress 2. (And also Dancing.)\  11/10 'So many hats.' -IGN  3/10 'No new Weapons.' -New Weapons Soldier.    K, I'm done."
Just trying to get into it how much it is awesome.... im going to try out the sniper class *if that fails soilder*
I paid $40 for a digital hat that spits out purple confetti. Was it worth it?     Yes.   9.6/10
"This has to be the best Free to Play game of all time. Sure, to get some of the cool stuff you'll actually have to pay for it with real money. But the overall experience of this game is amazing. There are so many different game modes and so many people to play with. There are also many different ways to customize your characters. So if haven't already gotten TF2, get it. It's totally worth it."
This game can be anything. You want horror? You got Slender-Fortress. You want Hilariousness? Well it's everywhere... Action? Yet again everywhere... Want brony stuff (Why did i put this here?) It's there too. Theres EVERYTHING! Including little annoying kids. 8/10 Too much Fortress ~IGN
this is the funniest game you can get in game industry.
"Ruins your life, 10/10 would play for years Anyone looking for a change from these dull grey and brown FPS's, whacky tf2 is for you!  also hats"
its lit
One of the best games ever made by Valve. Any Comedy and War Game players should definitely play this as it brings loads of comedy and fun. Awesome!
I'm bored of it.
"!!WARNING!! After so many hours this game will take ur social life! first u will play as a new beginner, then u get ur first hat!! When u get ur first hat ur wallet is gonna burn. then u get more hats the u dont even play the normal attack-defence u will only be on trade servers! i've used over 250€ so far on this game. So for all u new people this is my view: it's an amazing fun game and it's free! but be careful when u start u can stop!"
"The new update is terrible but I could deal with it. But after I found out they reskinned the rocket jumper to look like literal ♥♥♥♥ing garbage, that's where I draw the line. ♥♥♥♥ you valve."
"(THIS IS WRITTEN AFTER A MONTH WITHOUT PLAYING TEAM FORTRESS 2, AND MY THOUGHTS ON RETURN) Personally I love this damned game, I reccomment it more than anything else out there or on Steam,  Except now, due to the one update to kill the game: Meat Your Match  BEFORE THE UPDATE  I loved this game, I've spent a sum of cash donating to the game and the community creators and such to show I love it and (most) of the community so a few dollars here and there didn't hurt.  I played the game about 6 hours a day (unhealthy I know) every week with my friends or alone, it WAS alot of good fun and everything seemed pretty alright with the gameplay and the community and the game was just great for a few years, I won't make you bored you get the idea.  AFTER MEAT YOUR MATCH  Yes, some things were good such as the Engineer's teleporter buff, an... thats all I can really say personally. I don't really like the new Team Fortress 2. I once loved and cared to see this beautiful(ly Gory) game stay longer, but this new update, Meat Your Match, really put a damper on me. I don't like to see 'Ranks' or 'Competitive' crammed down my throat its not fun, its not Team Fortress.The new 'Balancing Gameplay' and everything else all SOUNDS nice and all sure, but when I played after the update was released, I was just shocked at how much it made me want to quit and not play it, but I kept going because I thought it was just a bad game.But after playing for about 2 hours of cringing and complaining about the game I just find myself not wanting to play or donate to the community anymore because the gameplay has died on me, as it did many people. I just don't know what happened, the teams seemed stakced by default. An example is one of my first few games, my team looked to be all around level 1-10 with the light blue emblem, but the enemy teams had purple emblems and really highly decorated ones and only a few lower level icons. The gameplay felt heavily one sided, and yes I AM BAD AT THE GAME, but if one team is decked out with experiance and the other is fresh meat, why play?  I don't mean to complain and whine about it, but its just...Disappointing. I'm not good at reviews or anything but the bottom line is Meat Your Match made this game just, die plain and simple.        -Just something else.  I think this is my first review, so I'd be much obliged if I didn't get killed by criticisim. :P"
"One of my favorite games to play because there's just SO many different ways to play, just by changing your loadout and even more by changing classes. Even outside of the normal game modes you have things like prophunt, dodgeball, deathrun, vs saxton hale, and so many others that can be a ton of fun to play."
"DISCLAIMER-- I Enjoy the game, BUT it has MANY issues in it that need to be addressed  While the over all game is well designed; it has a few KEY issues that hinder it- Some are more sever then others:  ________________________________________________________________   1. Hackers"
I recommend this game it is super fun and + ITS FREE NAO!!!
"I would recommend this game if it weren't for the removal of quickplay/ Valve Servers but since they removed them, I can't choose what maps to play, the wait times are rediculous, and buffs and nerfs that weren't necessary. Those reasons are why I don't recommend this game until they re-add quickplay which might never happen. EDIT:Well seems like valve didn't re add valve servers after a week and instead still believe in casual mode, I've already sold most of the most expensive items and I'm planning to sell more. Welp, no autobalance is fun! I just had a game on Mountain Lab where the enemy team had godlike players compared to our team which was comprimised of players who have never played TF2 at all. Thanks Valve!   Sincerely, :)"
The best free game Ever..COD is a ♥♥♥♥ compared to this one.. I stongly recommend!
its not bad its pretty good
"If TF2 were a hat, it'd be a fedora, because when you first start you look like an idiot and nobody likes you, but after you use it for a while, everyone just thinks you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and they hate you even more."
"It's fun, addicting, and doesn't attempt to rob you of your money (unlike most FTP titles). TF2 is really well-polished, well-crafted, and definitely a must play, even for people like me who don't typically care for a lot of shooters.    Thanks Valve, for making this game feel solid and fresh, even after all these years!"
"TF2 is one of the most fun FPSs around.  + Great gameplay and fair shooting. + No one class or weapon is overpowered. + Art design is great. + Map design is great. + Modes are all fun. + Co-op is fun, but costs money. + Never really gets old or stale. + It's free.  - Wayyy too much RNG in game. Random Crits are NOT a fair and balanced system.  - Auto balance. Balancing one player isn't going to change anything, just make them angry because now he's on the losing team. - Far too many cosmetics that clog up the game and turn it into a d*ck measuring contest. - Official in-game store prices for cosmetics are astrinomically high and basically pointless. - 90% of the servers are trade servers, not enough game servers.  8/10, download it you idiot, it's TF2, it's free."
"It's a good game , but needs some polishing in my opinion.  10/11"
"Well, ive almost spent 1000 hours on this game so... Lets go with that its really fun :D"
"Haven't written a recommendation yet - I must've been too busy playing the game! Seriously though, with 800+ hours of gameplay I can safely say this is my favourite FPS game. In fact, it's the only one I really find interesting - it's got that surreal quirk to it, the award-winning Pixar-like art style, and of course the fact that it records all of your stats. My OCD is pleased with that.  I'd definitely recommend giving this a go. Even if you don't like it (which I highly doubt) you can just uninstall it and you won't have lost any money as it's completely free. So give it a shot, it's worth it. ;)"
"Crazy fun. tons of pylons!    EDIT: For I have grown as a person and realized that this game is more than 'crazy fun' and 'tons of pylons'. It is much more, it is a movement. The team the fortress and the numeral 2 all work together to make a package so cohesive that you could throw bombs at it and it would just stay there, like a statue. The hats have a way about them, their polygons placed just right, it makes me want to cuddle up next to a hat and read 'goodnight moon' then promtly fall asleep next to the fireplace. Only once and a lifetime dreams come true and this is that expeirence, that transends media. Truly ruined real life for me. 8/10  EDIT: Hey I realized my actions were harsh and unjust I'm gonna bump that up to a 9/10 not because the game has become more fun for me.It is because I have transitioned into a person who likes odd numbers better than even ones. I was thinking beetween 9 and 7 that 9 is the better number based of of the fact that it's bigger and also looks better next to a 10. NOW YOU MIGHT BE THINKING, hey why didn't you change the 10? Well guess what I can't have a 9/9 can I? It would be a perfect score in that case and the only games I give perfect scores to are ones that don't exist yet because my level of critical judgment to this medium is intense and drives away all my friends and family. Also I couldn't have changed it to 9/11 because although I should never forget I should be having to remember it in the only game that gives me joy. So yeah it's still a good game and I have slipped like a someone would into a coma, deeper and deeper into hat based delirium, luckily the hats are not so much of a focus of my hallucinations any more it is mostly badges and vests. I find that the non-hat item hallucinations have a lower chance of causing spasms and convultions they are a real pain when I'm trying to play the only thing that makes me forget that I'm going to die one day(most likely alone), Team Fortress 2!"
played it for a couple hours. it's ok.
"This game Is Dang Awesome Man, I played It So Much I'm Addicted To It. For You People That havent tried this game. Man, your life is Boring, B.O.R.I.N.G. So PLay This Game, This Game Made My Life Full Of excitement"
"Ill get back to you when i accumulated some more hours in this game,its to little for a big review...  Spent more than 1500 hours in this game...and to be honest i dont even regret a second. This game just has something that will never make you bored,graphics are pretty good,sounds excelent... Some Game modes: Trading is also a fun if you are into it Death Run - well you get the idea Zombie Fortress - Zombies--&gt;Dont Get infected Payload(favorite game mode) -Push a Cart Bomb to enemy base while they try to stop you(blue attacks and pushes the cart-red defends and tries to stop the blue)  and many many more!"
"I welcome Competitive mode in TF2, but it doesn't need to go exactly alike with Overwatch for both Casual and Competitive.  Overwatch is a bit more serious theme, but TF2 allows players whether play seriously or socializing with players by partying, taunting, etc. It's too harsh to give penalties to players for leaving in CASUAL.  Having fun is not just about winning games."
"Whipped a 10 year old kid to death while dressed as Santa, then blew up his friend and didn't get arrested 10,5/10"
This is the best f2p game out there!!! 10/10
A really good game and the best free to play
"Team Fortress 2 is one of the most fun games I've ever played. It's simple without becoming repetetive, quirky without being childlike, and generally caters to everything I look for in a game. While recent updates have been substandard, the core gameplay is unchanged. I'd recommend TF2 to anyone who likes a good shooter that they can play casually without making a commitment."

"Team Fortress 2 in my opinion was the BEST game Valve ever made. It is lots of fun as there are 9 different classes to choose from and lots of cool weapons. I love the style of cosmetics each class has in the game. The amount of violence is also at an acceptable level as it doesn't show that much blood and it's mostly cartoon violence.  In conclusion, I think that this is the BEST game I have ever played made from Valve and I highly recommend this game in future to other players"
7 years and 5k hours later I'm basically living the game at this point.
hats
The best multiplayer FPS of all time.
Great game to spend time on and make profit off of. Also very fun.
best hat simulator game ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"Possibly the best f2p out there, but truly the best f2p in regards to Shooters. Anyone who hasn't heard of Team Fortress must have lived behind a rock, or be very young. If you're young, pls refer to YouTube to know what this game is all about."
This game was the my 1st FPS game and boy was i saprized i love how the classes had their own personalitys and all the wepons have diffrences
"A very nice and mostly friendly community out there in Team Fortress 2. I love the game's updates that sometimes change entire maps, or sometimes just a simple weapon. The game is free, however theres an ingame shop that supports actual money; in the shop you can buy various cosmetics for a class you like and play the most. I like the shop that it makes your own favorite class special: its not the same, its always different with alot of things to do in game. like a community game mode that has wacky things and mostly challenges to face in the game. thats all but I just put so much time into it, I think alot more people should play it and enjoy it."
"*READ THIS FIRST: My reviews are more like nostalgic stories,so expect more my personal opinion/story on that game and not a professional review.Please keep that in mind.Thank you! :) Ok.I first saw this games existence back in 2010.Young,crappy internet,was only dreaming of playing it.THen in 2011,a guy named alexanderz360 (something like that) uploaded a video on youtube how to play for free team fortress 2 (it was not free to play until 2011,june maybe something like that).I immidiately downloaded like 100 winrar parts,patches etc.I couldn't play online,because of my internet,but i was happy enough because there were bots.Yay. Soon i found out the game was FREE.I can't describe you how happy i was.That is also the same day i found out about steam.I made an account and downloaded the huge game (6-8 gbs not sure....pretty much to download for my slow internet).In 2012 a miracle happened.The place i lived,finally got the 'central' to get ADSL- the fast internet with cable. The rest is history...... It had nice updates,it had bad updates,but despite all of that-it was always FUN and CHALLENGING! Every class is unique and you can get hardly bored because of so much gameplay variety.I was part of 9vs9 teams, was active on 24/7 hightower server (Panda community server i think).Best moments i remember are from 2013 and 2014.Lately didn't really played the game that much (new updates required better pc,and as time was passing by my pc was getting worse and worse). I do not know how TF2 is today.But all i can say is,that is worth a try.It is not one of the best free to play games...IT IS THE BEST FREE TO PLAY GAME! If you never played TF2,or deleted it, i think it is time to try it again.When i get a decent laptop,i will definetely give TF2 a chance again. Thank you for reading my review/story. Have a nice day!"

"  Seriously, if you do not have this by now....  You are missing alot.  10/10"
"Team Fortress 2 is one of the best games you can play here on Steam. It is Free to Play with micro-transactions. That means it is up to you how much money you spend on the game. You can try it for free, stay if you like it or go if you don't. It's up to you and you won't regret downloading it. The game itself offers nine classes. Each of them fills a different role in the team. By the time you play, you will also get unlocks for each character. That basically means that there are multiple ways of playing the game. You can even put yourself a goofy loadout together if you prefer to play less serious. At the same time, the game shines because it is really unique in a way. It is full of gimmicks and the playstyle is very different from most shooter games. There is no Team Deathmatch and no normal Assault Rifle gun etc but exactly that is the reason why the game is so good. It offers way more than from what you get from all these repetitive shooter games that essentially play the same nowadays. Many different weapons, customizeable characters, taunts, unique gamemodes and gameplay, mods, a trading system... what else do you need? I do belive that is the reason why the game already survived so long and it still gets updated. In a nutshell, I suggest you to jump right into it if you haven't already. It's free. And if you like it, why not stay? ;)"
i played few times
Great and addicting game.
The best war-based hat simulator on the market.  11/10 would recommend
My favourite game of all time. I reccomend it to anyone that likes FPS games.
"10/10 I don't even need to say anything, you should know about this."
Best F2P FPS around
"Greatest game ever, Has a market for trading like the stock market, balance, skill, teamwork, etc. Everything you could ever want from a game."
"One heck of a game I say! Only let down I really had was the start of meet your match... Overall, It's pretty good!"
Haven't played much of this game but from what iv seen its a great cancer sim
 Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing
stem tolded me to do a review for a badge. is a gud
"I've spent over a thousand dollars on this game, that should probably say something... That Im a sad person.                     Valve please update this game already"
"This game, it is fun to do and interesting to play but i ill get boring after some time, sure there are hats to use and lots of wepons but it all in the end, its just the same thing and allot of times players are obsessed and just arnt very nice, i do recomend this game tho if you are a person into some stratigy game type things, but other than that dont waste money on hats or nothing, just play and have fun."
played it for a few hours.... its cool i guess...
"This game is honetly the best game I have ever played. Although people may think it old, this game has truely survived the test of time with its very passionate community. The game itself if very complex in every factor; whether refering to the movement systems, of simple things such as aiming. This game makes every aspect of the game complex, and thus makes the skill curve extremely high. Moreover, the large skill curve entices its players to practice everyday, and get better at the game. No wonder no one can ever completely leave TF2!"
"Dressed to kill, shoot for thrill. It's every fashionista/homicidal maniac's fantasy. If you're either of these or just like clicking on people to see their ragdolls go flying, play this game."
This game is really good.
"'Nine distinct classes provide a broad range of tactical abilities and personalities. Constantly updated with new game modes, maps, equipment and, most importantly, hats!'  To be honest as a major player of Team Fortress 2 this description from the store Page itself doesn't do light to the game at all in fact it probably scares people away from the game due to the fact that it basically states that its hat simulator. Team Fortress 2 in my opinion is a very good game however at the current moment it is on what we like to call 'game life support' the once famed Team Fortress 2 with its own unique art style and gameplay mechanics has become a money-grubbing clone of CS:GO trying to implement the skin method that CS:GO thrives on and trying to incorporate it into a beautiful game. This in my opinion is worth TF2 started to really lose its value as a whole different kind of game don't get me wrong I love the base game so much I love this game with all of my heart but I can't say as a community member for now 13 years on Steam that this game is just how it used to be back then. Keep in mind that I own $1,000 in this game in Virtual items I have done both the player route and the trader route in this game regardless of which one you pick or which one you are this review is for everyone.   To summarize my opinion on what team Fortress 2 is before the pros and cons I'm going to just leave a couple jokes here that will make sense to a lot of you who still play the game to this day.  Updates that killed TF2 uniqueness  Gunmettle-'It turned hat simulator into Skin Simulator!'  Invasion-'Pay to Unbox Simulator!'  Tough break-'Gunmettle with a new name!'  Heavy VS Pyro-'Where are the guns at? Still don't see pyro's new weapons.'   Meet your match-'Lobby Simulator 2016 mixed with no more valve servers that are non matchmaking'  Howloween-'The same update two years in a row! Unuslifiers Murdered the Taunt econamy and double unbox rates butchered the unusual market just as the skins butchered the australium market in gunmettle.'    Pros     There are two routes you can pick of course you can pick both but that depends on how well you can balance both. You can pick it as a route of a Trader or of a player.     The community is considered toxic however if you can stumble across a veteran (If they even play this game anymore) or across someone kind like me you can make plenty of friends playing Team Fortress 2     There are nine classes to choose from and there are multiple game modes such as pass time, matchmaking, competitive, man vs. machine, and plenty of community game modes to keep replayability High     If you're looking to get into Trading as a business this is the game you can start it out on due to metal being an easy currency to handle compared to floats of skins in a game like CS:GO.      Cons     The man vs. machine Community when playing a mode such as mann-up can be very unforgiving to new players even if the new players have been through boot camp before hand.     Scammers are a huge issue in Team Fortress 2 or anything for that matter trying to use team tactics, private profiles, or promising real life cash for items causing a great deal of loss towards the victim stay frosty when it comes to this because if you do get scammed Vavle ever help you. In layman's terms it's every man for himself.     Valve's updates on this game so far have been horrible. Don't get me wrong past updates before gunmettle we're great but many of the updates that have come out as of recent have even made me question why I still play this game.

Best FPS game I have ever played I would definitely recommend this to a friend nice work Valve ;3.
Pros:   I spent +$200 in game.   Cons:  I spent +$200 in game.
I have been playing this game for 3 years and I still enjoy it. There are many ways to spend your time with this game. 1- It is free to play 2- You can play public or mge servers and learn some skills  3- Trading 4- Discover new friends and new communities 5- New mods 6- It doesn’t require an expensive computer to play this game 
Yeah it's not bad for a couple hours I guess.
What's not to love about this game?
"This game is really fun, it's alot like Halo except it has vehicles."

"TeamFortress 2 is an arena objective based fps.  The fast pace and gun mechanics are based off of Quake, making it unique vs all other modern fps titles.   While being old, it still stands strong amongst all first person titles. From memorable charecters to the excellent game mechanics to the comedic ragdolls and voice lines, this title can appeal to any player.   So download TeamFortress 2 today! Its the most fun you will have with a free game.  Its sure going find a place in your favorite's list.          And wallet."
I will come back to this game time and time again. Hands down the most fun I have online. Great communities for everyone exist as well; albiet you have to do a bit of searching. 11/10
Best game ever...sniping a good job m8. ▄︻̷̿┻̿═━一
"I stronly advice people of all ages over 8 to play this game, it has millions of differant tactics and play stiyles. there and also traders where you can game money without spending a penny if you know how to do it."
Is good.  A 9+ year old cartoony shooter that still is irregularly updated multiple times a year. Has a surprisingly much depth in it and can be enjoyed both casual players and people who like getting good at video games. Community is generally friendly even though the fact that -more toxic = more vocal- can make it seem otherwise. The game might be a bit discouraging at first since 100+ weapons that you think are upgrades(when most of them are really not) and playing against people with thousands of hours of experience who can seem unbeatable are a factor. But if you can get over all that you'll be enjoying one of the best F2P games out there.
Still my favorite after all these years!

"Highly competitive shooter for tryhards. Make no mistake on that. Valve markets it as something else but it doesn't change what it is. It's NOT easy to pick up. If you're new to quake-like shooters, you'd better have a friend already playing it explain the basics to you, or you might get frustrated by some things.  Public pvp and pve (known as mvm in tf2) servers are suitable for casual players once the basics are learned. If you don't want to go comp you can stop there and have quite a bit of fun.  Sweaty competitive tryhards will really see where this game shines though. Well balanced, competitive modes will bring your tactical sense and deathmatch ability to a real test. Despite Valve overlooking the competitive format, multiple leagues have arisen offering unforgettable experience for teams on any skill level. If You want to do team based esports, look no further than TF2, this game has more competitive spirit in it than LoL and DOTA combined.  As for visual aesthetics the game looks well despite its age, thanks to its stylised look. Some items from content updates are very much out of the game's theme, though, which is very disappointing given how unique that theme is. The game is poorly optimised in some instances too, (especially mvm), but that can be solved by fps boosting configs.  All in all:  Iz good."

"This game is such an amazing one indeed. I always somehow find myself playing this game at any time i can. Whether its the fast-paced gameplay, the lovable characters, or the fun and interesting mods. This game is truly one i can recommend. Plus i mean, it's free. Come on. How can you beat that? I can tell you, if you can find any way to be bored playing this, i would LOVE to see it. However, im quite convinced it doesn't exist.. If you have a chance, try to play this one. Who knows, you may just find a new fun hobby in your life."
"Good game, really worth my time playing!"
"Team Fortress 2 is a very unique and fun game, the amount of fun unlocks and custom maps, means that it'll take you a LONG LONG LONG time to see everything this game has to offer. If you think you've seen everything there is to see in this game, I can assure you that you're wrong. The graphics are very unique, and I love the way they look. The classes have their rivals, and all have their own funny personalitys. Scout is that annoying child, pyro is that mystery masked man/woman, demo is that drunk scottish man. All the characters are very unique, and I feel i'll never forget them. However this game has some flaws. Very small ones at that. Some of the weapons that you can unlock are unbalanced. Resulting in one person stomping your team. However with constant patch updates, this isint really a problem.  Overall I love Team Fortress 2, it's my favorite game. I reccomend it to everyone, even people who never play fps games. I give TF2 Overall a 9.6/10."
"This is an amazing game to play. I got it using the Orange Box Pack. I was planning on using it only for Half Life 2, but noticed that I enjoy the Team Fortress 2 game a bit more! It is an infinately addicting game, with easy multiplayer, and plenty of maps. I give them 6 stars, if possible. XD"
This game was the my 1st FPS game and boy was i saprized i love how the classes had their own personalitys and all the wepons have diffrences

Great game to spend time on and make profit off of. Also very fun.
its fun and it has hats
"Played for a little bit. Boring,"
Like skyrim with hats - 10/10
A must-play FPS. F2P!
"I've enjoyed this game for years and thoroughly recommend it for those new to the FPS genre. It's fun to play and very easy to get used to.  *EDIT* - TL;DR - Used to love it, now I play it occasionally for a bit of nostalgia. I'm an old fart stuck in the past who dislikes change.  I reviewed this game back in 2012 and while I stand by the opinion that it's a decent FPS for people to get into, and it has a relatively fair learning curve, my love for this game has taken a nose dive over the past few years.  When I started playing this game, it was back when you just had the stock weapons and the alternative unlocks (ala backburner). While I may be looking back with rose tinted goggles on, I remember personally having much more fun when everyone was on more of an even keel with each other. Don't get me wrong, I think the community involvement that Steam pushed has really opened the game up, and the game modes people have made (such as Zombie Fortress, Prophunt etc) are a wonderful example of what the gaming community is capable of. The range of custom maps available is also eyewateringly vast, another positive for the game.  I also still recommend this game, because it is still very easy to jump into for anyone. The fact that it is now free also helps that, nothing is lost by giving it a go. However, I personally do not get as much enjoyment from this game as I used to and therefore play it a hell of a lot less. I've racked up over a 1000 hours, so I've definitely got my money's worth (and believe me, back in its hay day it was well worth the cash monies spent on it).  I also find it hard to gripe about all the hats and killstreak ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, because I've seen how much my friends enjoy that aspect of the game. The Mann vs Machine mode also improved my opinion on the game and it is usually what I play nowadays when I decide to load the thing up for old time's sake. As it stands now though, it's lost its magic for me."
Spent a lot of real world monies on cosmetics...must be a good game I guess.
"mindless fun with a touch of madness, just the way a FPS should be"
"After the introduction to competitive modes, I just refuse to play this game now. I waited in lobby for 40 ♥♥♥♥ING MINUTES AND STILL DIDN'T GET IN TO A MATCH. I want to play just a casual game of TF2 for 15 to 20 mintutes, not wait ♥♥♥♥ing HOURS to be forced to play a match, and when the match is not even good, and I leave, I don't want to wait ANOTHER 40 ♥♥♥♥ING MINUTES to be able to get into another match, if I even get in after 40 mintues. I'll change this review when you put quickplay back into the game VALVE. RIP TEAM FORTRESS 2"

Addicted like a back alley hooker and heroin. Fun game.
A Gun game full of thrill and excitement....
It is good day to play TF2
Its addicting... Something hard to stop... Please don't play this game..... Play it
If you like hat themed conga simulators than just give tf2 a shot.  I've played this game for nearly 3000 hours at the time of writing and I enjoyed every single one of them.
Team Fortress 2 is by far the best shooter game i've ever played and perhaps one of the best games I have ever played. It's still as fun today as it was years ago. I don't see it dying off anytime soon.
"Team Fortress 2 is a fun FPS for the casual gamer, although can be fun to those who are very serious twards gaming. This is a combination of fun, times of trouble, funny diaglogue, and overall a very good game."
It is good day to play TF2
"This has to be the best f2p game out on steam right now. This game is incredibly fun, and has lots of servers to explore, and is also challenging. Even though this game has had hard times, It's still being updated and Valve is trying it's hardest to see what they can improve. (And nerf any upcoming weapons.) Hopefully, there will be newer features in this game, and I look forward to that. I highly reccomend this game to everyone out there, from the bottom of my heart. But, after a while, if this game starts to lose it's sharpness, It will still have a place in your heart. I met almost all of my friends here in tf2, and it has a great community. Thanks for making this game Valve."
"Great Game,Great Content ,Great maps ,Great everything Exept mann co store being a little be expensive no other fact to point out I Recomment it to New Gamers and Just gamers in general ,then you tell me about cod you bloody ♥♥♥♥♥♥!  i rate it 10/10 "
Awesome Game with an nice trading system to switch stuff with other users.
♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
"This game is a fast paced first person shooter, ranging from going deep undercover as a spy, to building high tech sentry guns."
"I've played this game for 4.4k hours, and I absolutely love it. People may claim that it's dying and that it's bad, but it's really not that. The game has characters with personalities, very lovable ones at that, and is overall amazing. Takes a bit of skill varying on what class you take on. There's really not much else to say. Once you get the game, it all becomes clear."
"The community is horrible, It's infested with trolls and griefers, the economy is a joke and full of scammers, community servers are the absolute worst and the admins are to blame for that. VAC is useless, and it's unbalanced. The only actual good thing about this game is the artwork, other then that it's a complete waste of time.  10/10 If you're a piece of ♥♥♥♥  2/10 If you're a person who enjoys good games  Take a look at my total hours played if you think I'm just a newbie scrub hating on the game.  Edit(8/23/2015): Went back in to see if anything changed, and valve decided to copy the cs:go gimmick trash with even more useless cosmetics and more ways to steal content from the 'community workshop' so they can put even less effort into releasing whatever that ♥♥♥♥ is that they call 'content' LMAO, nice one valve."
"This game is horrible I absolutely hate it. Not worth your time.  DO NOT BUY, EVEN ON SALE "
What can i say? Get it. It's simple as that
All around boring plus there are 12 year olds EVERYWHERE
Best game ever! Evrything is balanced and even f2p. Just awesome!   It's well thought out and executed.  There's something for anyone and everyone.  420/420 would install again

The only game that took me away from Gunz (2007-2014). It's been a blast!
that is a cool game
"Officially, as of this halloween event, Gaben gave up on tf2. Don't even download this game. They all stopped caring. It shows with this update. Nothing new, it was broken for the first couple days, and its about to be over anyway. Unless the christmas update is good, this game is dead, and only the market is keeping it up. And yet, people in the market are pulling out. Sorry valve. I put alot of time seen on my profile and unseen on two others that i lost. I loved this game, but all good things come to an end. Soz m8's. Times up, lets all go back to halo and cod and whatever else you guys play alot. Try out dirty bomb. Its aight."
Thanks a lot valve! Now I have to wait 30 @#$%ing minutes just to play casualy.   Bring back quickplay. DON'T FORCE MATCHMAKING ON US.
Rest In Peace old Team Fortress.   The new update is the definition of insanity.
Team Fortress 2 is the first reson why im in steam now   but now this game is dead  Overwatch didn't kill Team Fortress 2  Valve who kill this game    R.I.P TF2  2007-2016   NOTE:this review will removed after any good update
Game's not fun anymore. Competitive update killed the game. Just go play overwatch. 0/10
This game to me was the best and is the best!
"&gt;Created key binds that said 'Noob down', '#Banter' and 'Rektomancer strikes again!' &gt;Used them everytime I killed someone, usually in really 'noobish' ways. &gt;Caused more anger than Thatcher's reign. &gt;Sat in a cesspool of laughter. &gt;Infinite/10"
TF2 Is Copying CS:GO  Gg.   It Ruined My Life COMPLETELY xD
"It feels almost sad to me to watch TF2 now, sure it's still more of the same but I can't help but feel that the love that was once there isn't there anymore. This game is what pulled me from Xbox to PC so why do I just feel pity for this game running on for so long when I used to want to watch it become an unstoppable titan on PC with no end in sight? I think it stems back to what I'd call the 'peak' of TF2 (In my time of being around) which I felt was Love &amp; War because I remember how the game that was just becoming a little too stale got the biggest injection of life and fun with new taunts, weapons and all around great memories. However I noticed something off after a week or so, the community was becoming 2 factions and I had never seen this before, one side wanting to conga and party the other wanting a hardcore pub server every match. I kept on playing though. When a trailer named 'End of the Line' came out my hype was beyond containing and I thought up so many weapons I've seen that will possibly come to life on update day. I had so many thoughts of how this is the update to end the game, one last bang with everything and anything we could want or need. When Finally on December 8th we were hit with a crushing reality where this update that had so much hype for turned into a simple cosmetic update and I was crushed. I kept playing though. With a pit in my stomach the new update rolled out with quite a split, Gun Mettle. CS:GO skins in TF2 and people thought the world was ending and to top it off this update was a pay to play update to start the campaign. However I was loving every second of the new group tanut and the Snowplow map, not to mention I was in love with some skins. Like all good things though I was quickly brought back down to sadness when Invasion hit. It had sounded like there would be new weapons and a new game mode from all the hype. The game mode was average at most and the reskins turned my love for the game to anger and I left for Payday for quite a while. I returned midway in the Tough Break update when I saw a similar but different game. The magic was just gone for me at this point and soon enough other games caught my eye, mainly Overwatch. Where TF2 grew stale with me other people kept going. I full departure from TF2 was Meet Your Match when I felt as if TF2 changed so drastically to just compete with Overwatch's rapid growth in competitive play. Sure I've been reading and it looks like TF2 is back to how it's been for 9 years just with a different hat stacked on it's head again. I'm not saying you should quit TF2 because Overwatch is just better or anything. I just want to explain about how I broke away from this game and things I felt after 4 years on this game and many disappointments. So if you enjoy TF2 still then more power to you and if you hate TF2 with a burning passion then I don’t care about that either. All this review is for is to say my peace about TF2 before I’m done with it for good."
"This game is trash, that is why I've spent money and 1k+ hours playing it"
Was once a really fun and competitive game once  ♥♥♥♥ this update delete this stupid update pls   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=720088913&amp;fileuploadsuccess=1 
This update is probably made by the same guy who thought that mixing google+ and youtube was a good idea.
Try to find a good community server or have a very miserable time.
"Team Fortress 2, the game that I spent over 1,100 hours playing. The game that I enjoyed so much, and used to love is just broken. Stupid Competitive mode, skins and basically trying to make money out of everything instead of balancing the game, really Valve? I was even not bothered with cosmetics system, those who wanted to be cool would just buy stuff, and those who don't wouldn't just give a ♥♥♥♥. I was very tolerant with every update, I thought 'Hey, maybe they will see the point, maybe they will try to focus on game itself, not on game's income. But no, instead, they make unbalanced ♥♥♥♥ even more unbalanced. Weapon skins? No thanks, we don't need another CS:GO around. And it's really sad how Valve has forgot about game itself. And this competitive mode, which is literally broken, and everyone's unhappy about it? That's just enough.   Fun, addicting and really silly game, has been turned into another Wallet emptying ♥♥♥♥ with blurred future.  And not talking about TF2 now, I hate how Valve has became so ♥♥♥♥ing lazy, and selfish."
"$10 for a Competitive game if I don't have a phone? With that money I could just save to buy CS:GO, Overwatch, or even a ♥♥♥♥ing phone. And the wait time on the matches is so much longer.  Am I hating on the game, a little not gonna lie.  Do I think they made this game awful with the update as of making this review, hell yea.  Look Valve, stop trying to compete with Overwatch, or trying to make your game a little more like CS:GO cause if I wanted to play CS:GO I would, I play this game casually. (Besides the fact if I did play comp on this game I would still be told to die in real life or that I'm some sort of Disease/Illness by some 10 year old.)  Note: I do know Valve is fixing this, but they didn't need to do this to a game that had nothing wrong with it and didn't need a bad Competitive match. Also PLEASE DO NOT HATE JUST CAUSE YOU DISAGREE, it's my opinion it's ok if you don't like it but please don't hate."
"Okay, maybe I haven't played the game for too long, but I'll be honest now: Team Fortress 2 is simply the best FPS game ever made. It has almost no bugs, the characters have their own unique personalities and the game is full of humor and fun. It's a good game to play for hours (seriously, it takes FOREVER to have all the achievements or unlockables). My rating is 9.75/10. This is a must-have for every gamer."
after this new update it tolttaly ♥♥♥♥ing sucks cause we cant even create any servers anyomore wtfffffff this update 
"sorry for my bad english , because iam a vietnamese. Tf2 my favorite game is become trash because the new update, i join a casual ame and only see cheater . Pls vavle do some thing, i dont want my game become trash so remove those freaking cheater and able vote for me pls. :'("
"Was better a year ago. Now you have to wait like 5 minutes until you find a 'casual' match. I'm alright with the new hud, but the gameplay got really worn off. Why making someone wait to join if it worked instantly a year ago??? This got just BAD. "
"Can't recommend this game anymore after the matchmaking update. Before the matchmaking update it took me 10 seconds to jump into any Valve server. Now I have to wait 2-7 mins for matchmaking to get me in a server. My favorite mode was KOTH, which is usually a short 6-12 minute match. After a very short KOTH match I am forced to sit at the matchmaking screen for another 2-7 minutes. Community servers are also dead. It's unacceptable what Valve has done to this game.."
"Rocket flies above your head. Fire burns the surrounding. Grenade lies over the floor(it will explode any second). Bullets spam everywhere. People running around trying to hit you. Intensely feel that you will die from 1 shot kill. Nervous and worry about backstabbing. You have no way to escape except for doing the things above.  That's right. CHAOS!! One shall not simply stop! If you stop at the middle of the road, you die. If you jump, you die. You walk, you die. Yes. Every single move is towards death. All you can do is fightback! This game is extremely ENJOYABLE! What's so fun about keep dying in a game? Well, you can respawn and go for alternate way.  Do this game has replay values? Of Course. You must play at your own risk, as you may get addicted to it. You get to play every classes with different tactics. Therefore, you'll experience different kind of gameplay.  I'm afraid that this game will be dead and the server would be empty. Well, no worries, mate. Is Counter-Strike dead yet? No. TF2 is more fun than CS! Besides, Valve always keep this game updated with special event such as Anually Halloween Event(which is my favourite event).  This game provides trade system. Trading is another fun activity you can do in TF2. Due to the massive amount of items in TF2, you can trade to get your long-wishes item!  Overall, this is a comedy-filled action rpg-like multiplayer game. You will like it. I promise!"
"In EA's new hit title, Team Fortress 2: Band of Brothers, you play as one of nine different characters through gritty war scenarios that tell the tale of two PMC companies embroiled in a privately funded war. On one side is the REDfor team, a band of experienced Veterans based in Europe. On the other is BLUfor, a ruthless mercenary group based primarily in Russia.  From the minigun-toting cigar smoking character Ivan 'Heavy Weapons' to the cocky, accented demolitions expert Tavish 'Smokey' DeGroot, this game will provide a whole new level of immersion with characters you care for, realistic battlefields and vehicles, and over 100 real weapons including the P90, Mossberg, M16, and a fan favorite, the Gluon Gun.  For only $79.99, this game is what is described by reviewers like IGN and Gamespot the 'pinnacle of modern FPS's.' Pre-order it now and you can get two tactical maps of Teufort and Coldfront, a limited edition Gamer's Guide, and the 'End of the Line' DLC for free!"
"This is one of the best games i have ever played,I don't really care about the glitches,some of the are funny.I recommend"
A game that has gotten me through stress and hard times. A game that has stood the test of time. A game that has customization beyond belief. A game that has been through and changed many times. A game that has made its name in history.
"Team Fortress 2, those 3 words are what make up a big journey of mine that is still going. TF2 is a shooter game that isn't like those other ones. It has one thing that most other first person shooters do not. Have a guess, go on! It's trading! Currently in the halloween event for 2016, TF2 is well known for its trading, cosmetics &amp; huge variety of items and things to equip.   Having played this game for over 500 hours, I must say it's impressive &amp; fun. Since it's currently the Halloween event, the merasmissions are very fun but can also take a while for some who have not done them before.   TF2 isn't one of those games where it is really complicated and confusing. Nope. I remember my first match in TF2 when I went for medic and actually surprisingly did well. Even without premium, TF2 can still be fun with the MVM boot camp Co-Op and there are so many different things to do on the community servers too! Deathrun, Saxton Hale, different MVM modes such as story mode, and loads more. This proves that TF2 is a true game that has so many options to play and explore.  So if you're on Steam and looking for a suitable F2P game that you think is worthy of your time, give TF2 a try. I guarantee you won't regret it.  Thank you for reading this review, Emporius  "
"Phlog is the only way to play pyro, any other primary weapon is trash"
who makes this garbage??  it sucks. prob worst game ever. buy a good game like sonic genesis collection its better than this because it has more games it better than team gaytress 2
What the ♥♥♥♥ just happened with this game?
Just 2muchConga4u these days
A awesome game.
"A game for in between. Despite all this, a good game (:"
Anyone who plays soldier is a fat ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ who has no skill and should uninstall
Fun to play with friends
"I haven't played much of the game yet, but Team Fortress 2 is an incredibly fun experience that shouldn't be passed up. The game follows 9 mercenaries on two teams battling each other to the death in order to complete a certain objective depending on what game mode they are on. What really makes the game unique is that each class doesn't seem too highly overpowered like in Call of Duty or Halo. Each one has their weaknesses and relies on other classes to help them stay alive. For example, the Medic class is designed to heal teammates and occasionally grant them invulnerability to bullets at the expense of a poor arsenal. He needs to be protected by the class he's healing because he can't defend for himself very well. The Engineer class relies on his Sentry turret which can be deployed to wreck havoc on enemies trying to invade his base. Along with this, he can deploy a dispenser which grants ammo/health to his team and two teleporters (good for helping them get out into battle quickly). Although he can't be with most of the others fighting on the front line, he still helps them immensely with these inventions. Along with uniquely designed classes, the art style of the game is gorgeous in its own way, as it's not too realistic with a fun cartoon art style. The voice actors for each class are hilariously over-the-top which adds to the enjoyability of playing as each of them, and even if you don't like what they seem to offer they're still worth a go. I'd defenitely recommend this game to anyone. The classes are fun, the gameplay is fun, and the visuals are even 'fun', I'd say. This is probably one of the best multiplayer shooters you can come across - and it's free, too!"
"The new update for team fortress 2, as of 7/8/16 has made this game far less fun to play and the wait times are rediculous. I recomend playing the game after Valve fixes this, or play any game mode other than casual."
"I absolutely love this game. All for one or all for yourself, you can experience fun in any type of game play!"
TF2 2007-2016 rip in peperoni Last update killed the game
one of the best game ever and it is really a good trading game so play it
"The new interface looks nice. But one function sucks. In the old interface I was able to select the type of game I wanted to play and then go play it. Now, I can't do that. I can list it as a choice, but I'm also forced to allow the game to search for game types that I don't want to play.   For example: I like playing the manpower maps. Manpower is listed, but it never comes up as a choice. And if I don't like the map I'm on I can't just leave it and find a map I do like because if I do I'll be banned. That completely sucks. It's like steam is taking notes from microsoft. Utter crap. If this continues I'll just have to uninstall the game and call it good. Nothing lasts forever. Maybe this is the end of the TF2 I've come to enjoy so much. It happens.  But this inability to choose my game type after having become used to being able to do that just takes away from the fun of playing it."
TF2 was good the way it was before the competitive update. Now it's ♥♥♥♥.
"9 classes, hundreds of unique weapons, all lead to a thousand possible gaming styles. One of the best FPS games out there for casual gaming with enough depth and complexity. At first the graphics may appear cartoonish but with the great community and regular updates, who cares. 10/10 would play again!"
Fun to play.  Its very fast paced and there are many different ways to customize your classes to describe your personalty. From hats to weapons.
"Amazing fun, fast paced game for all to play."
"I liked this game, but valve ♥♥♥♥ed it over with the new update. Screw you."
"After not playing this game for years, it was good to see they added a horde mode called 'Mann vs. Machine'. IMO the most enjoyable feature of this game.  You can't take this game too seriously, with all it's crazy cosmetic items and taunts, just a game you play for a couple of hours a week for fun, alone or with friends ξ( ^‿^)ξ▄︻┻┳═一"
"MYM was the nail in the coffin for TF2 as it stands,  -Questionable balance updates that show the devs really don't play their own game -No more quickplay means the only non competitive style servers seem to be riddled with ads and mods -a series of unoptimized updates are continuing to kill FPS, forcing players to make their games look ugly to make them playable -Splits the community in half over fixes to two classes that both need them to be viable -More nerfs to pyro, the class that can be countered by most people with brains already"
"Plays over 700 hours of TF2. (Understanding I don't even scratch the surface of skill) Plays competive beta. Enjoys (for the most part) the beta. Meets cool people on beta. Gets much better at game due to the beta. July 7th happens. All hell breaks loose on all Valve servers. Casual mode, top-scores each time. Trys competive (Medic main BTW). Gets 3 gibus' on my team. Lose horrendously. Is destroyed by good team.  Next match, complete gibus team. Is destroyed by a 2 unusuals team. Tells them to go to pubs, 10 hours isn't enough to do competitve. GETS TOLD TO LEAVE BY A 12 YEAR OLD. Writes angry review of this trash game. Contemplates why I bought an unusual.  Thanks Valve, you really ♥♥♥♥ed up this game. I spent at least $60 on cosmetics and ♥♥♥♥, to get ♥♥♥♥ed over and over again by the pseudo-competitive and super broken competitive modes. If you want my help, and I know you don't care nor want my help, make the competitive mode more restrictive than 25 cents."
"You have to love how all the positive reviews are from years ago, and then Valve decided to destroy one of their best games.  I quit a week after seeing the destruction of TF2 with Meet Your Match. All the gameplay/mechanics, horrid cosmetics, maps. I stopped liking this game after skins really. With worse updates that don't help the game at all, what was the point of continuing?  To be honest, I feel really bad for everyone who loved this game and have so many hours in it. I hope everyone finds a new game to replace this.  Good luck to all of you and the community. I must remove any 'positives' I've had for this game.   ...All I do is trade unusuals, like a normal person."
The new update is ♥♥♥♥
Yolo
"Bring back quickplay for casual. finding matches take too long after the new update. also, i cant join my friends games through steam client. i HAVE to make a room with my friends first. and i got kicked from a team i was contributing to more than the no points. i am dropping this game for OverWatch."
"The new 'Meet Your Match' Update is atrocious. Great concept, horrible implementation. I've been a long time fan of TF2, but this update takes the cake for serious ♥♥♥♥. Unless something changes, in my eyes, TF2 is dead."
"This game was the reason to join Steam.  After all this years, they keep adding new content that can change the way the game is played or the way your character looks with a lot of HATS!!!  All the characters are different and you can be entertained by their voice-lines.  The gameplay can change a lot depending on the weapon you use. It can give you an advantage on the battlefield, but they will always find a way to balance that by using a different class or weapon to stop you.  The maps are very diverse and you have a lot of game modes to play. Except Hydro. Nobody plays Hydro.  This game was created with the whole purpose of having fun killing each other and, after all this time, it doesn't get old.  Even if you think that you still have to spend money on the game to have a bigger backpack, think it better as an investment. Because this game will give you more than just hours and hours of fun.  Mann vs Machine can be as cancerous as Dota 2. So you better play it with friends or else you'll be kicked because you didn't do what some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ told you to do."
"There's hats, and guns, and death."
"They've killed the game with the latest update, i've got nothing to say other than what everyone else's said already. I knew that TF2 was going to die eventually, but not by their own hand. This is BS.  TF2 Is dead.  Finally."
I like playing this game its fun
Who doesn't want a hat with fkn flames on it?
♥♥♥♥ your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Meet Your Match update. This game is hanging by a ♥♥♥♥ing thread. Do you know what that means? Seems to me like Valve is intentionally trying to make everybody quit to give them an excuse to shut down TF2 and work on some other project(s). Bring back the TF2 of yesterday you incompetent developers or quit your job and let real pros handle it.
What a masterpiece of a game. You could be pushing a bomb in this game while a person plays 'All Star' by Smashmouth over their mic. Truly a beautiful game.
"I didnt buy a hat yet. looks like i have a hat immunity. I will give a sample of my DNA to scientists to find a cure for this hat epidemic! forget ebola, hats oblitorated more lives!!!"
Has taken away my social life. All I ever think about are about my hats. 10/10
"As promised, Heavy will now lay egg in your mouth"
"I no longer reccommend or care to play a game where it takes LONGER to get into a match than it does to FINISH the match. What on EARTH was valve thinking when it implemented this update? Did they not test it out first to see if people would like it? No longer can you play in quickplay pubs, you must wait 30 minutes OR MORE to play on a map you may not even like. let's hope the huge amount of complaints don't fall on deaf ears over at valve, or the game will no longer be played by, what seems to be, the majority of players."
"Seriously, don't get this game until Valve fixes all the bugs and server delays in the Heavy vs. Pyro Update. Chooseing a low-ping server impossible. Choosing the map is impossible. Playing more than one round is impossible. Kicking AFK players and hackers is impossible. Getting onto a server in less than 2 minutes is impossible; try waiting around for periods of &gt;10 minutes before Valves chooses which map to play.   Valve has made enjoying this game impossible. Is TF2 better than Overwatch? That's now impossible."
"The new update is bad. I've played 4 games, each time we had at least 1 idler and at least 2 people leave before the match ends. I can't find a good team. Autobalance doesn't work at all, the other team had 4 more people and nothing happened. In one of the games my team gave up the first point before setup was over. Frankly, removing pubs ruined tf2 almost completely. Honestly, unless you really want to play casual don't, you will be extremely dissapointed."
This game is absolutely excellent for anyone who likes FPS games.
"It is a game,If you are REALLY Intelligent this game is Frickin' Awesome.But if you think this: Hats are everything,i can go to work and get at least 200 dolar per week and i buy hats. I am premium.What now?I have a set for Medic(Or anything else)!Now i gonna just play with this. Another guy:Do you haevnt got another hats? Who need this?Pfffff. I am F2P.I just wearing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gibus and a pyrovision s**t.I am a worthless idiot. Well,please,im begging pleeeease leave the game or understand.This game is not for accesories,This game is for premium's accesories.Hey Premium's!Go and buy hat!F2P's!Go and have fun :3 But...You must buy hats with trading,NEVER with Mann co. Store.Think the real world goodies that you can buy with one unusuals price.This game AWESOME,but if you are INTELLIGENT.I will want to help the 'Richs' That spending money in a 'virtual' game.This game is awesome,but if you are have to spend money good.  Some Comments From Our Friends:   This Was Frickin' Awesome While I'm Crushing Skulls And Beating Peoples Face!-Scout I Used This Mann co. Shovel While I Playing This Game And My Opinion,I Would Do Again!-Soldier Mmphphphpmmmphpmh!Mmppphmmmphhhmmpmhhpphhmmph!-Pyro Lads,Blow Up People,Jump Like A Bird,And Play This Game!-Demoman I Like This New Weapon,This New Sandvich And This New Fists!-Heavy Think Like A Man,Shorty.-Engineer Danke My Hard Hatted Friend!-Medic Thank You Doctor!-Heavy I Love This Game!-Medic Is This Another Skull Fracture?No,its Headshot.

TF2 is the greatest multiplayer game ever made.you can get craft hats make weps and amek friends :D thats only i have to say now :D
This is the best free to play game ever!
"If you enjoy shooting drunk scotsmen with a ♥♥♥♥-gun, this game is for you."
9 Classes for a huge variety of play styles. Multicultural characters for a colourful experience. Humorous dialogue from a skilled team of voice actrors. Comical animations. Vast community influence. Constant updates and holiday events. Many game modes including tdm styles and Co-Op.  This game will amuse you for hours and it is free... WHY WOULDN'T YOU GET IT?!  If you want more it can give you more.  If you don't want to get swept in the hype you wont be punished for it!
spent $100 to paint all hats pink. 10/10 will play agian
Ruined the whole ♥♥♥♥ing Valve with the new update
"I'm honestly not sure why Valve thought this update was such a good idea.  If nothing else, why disable voting? You've basically encouraged hacking since you can't votekick anymore. Also, yeah, autobalance may've been annoying, but it's nowhere near as annoying as being stuck with horribly unbalanced teams."
I was actually considering hosting my Server again.  Then the new update came out.   Never again.
"Awesome gameplay, BEST community, and steep learning curve. A game that hopefully will live forever. "
It's the most fun game I played for so far.
"I downloaded Tf2 in 2011 and it was one of the best games i had ever played when i first started playing and it has stayed amazing through the years up until valve became a greedy money pot and quit caring about the quality and orignality of the game, the game has just in 2016 alone became a Complete rip off of CSGO just because valve wants extra money. I used to love this game with a passion but now since its become TFGO with the weapons and skins just to fit in with all the other big names I feel like TF2 has sold itself out and lost everything it once stood for, This game has been ruined and almost completely transformed into just another boring first person competetive shooter instead of the fun game i once knew"
"Volvo fix this ♥♥♥♥ that TF2 is now. Just bring quickplay back, Put class and weapon restrictions in competitive, and reverse the jumpers skin (they look like ♥♥♥♥ now)."
"An Easy game to get into, Multiple classes add for better game play, and being able to pimp load outs is amazing c;"
this game has destroyed me and everything i stand for. pls play it
Where are my pubs?!
I agree
"I bought this when I first got Steam, but originally didn't enjoy it. Between having an old computer and a terrible internet connection, the game was practically unplayable.  But about 2 years ago, I upgraded both. A couple of months ago, I decided, on a whim, to give it another go.  This game is a lot of fun. The balance between the players is fantastic, with the short-range (but very powerful) Pyro to the far more tactical demoman, you can find what suits your flavor of play."
"Team Fortress 2 Is a free to play game. Its fun and has many great communitys. Theres two sides of team fortress 2 competitive and trading. Both sides are great and have their ups and downs. Team Fortress 2 allows friends to connect while being able to play together and having fun along with other gameplays tf2 provides (MvM, Plr, Ctf, Ect,). Team Fortress has been a wonderful game to play (and still is) and not to mention the creativity and customizing that can be shown in the characters. I recomend this game to everyone as its fun and enjoyable!"
I don't have much to say about this game just play it. ITS FREE!!!!! ITS AWESOME!!!!! you will enjoy it.
"Valve screwed the game big time with the new update.. say goodbye to quickplay and welcome the new 'Wait 30 minutes for nothing' meta. But what bugs me the most is how the 'Casual' gamemode is now ranked?! Wtf were you thinking Valve, seriously.."
-1. 08.07.2016 this game was killed by developers. R.I.P.
"you can poot a hat... over a hat ! 11/10 would make a hat tower any time  On the serious note. I have heard of this game back in 2009 and when i heard in 2011 that it's now Free 2 Play on 2013 i got the chance to play it, since then i keep spending hours and hours in it for being such a fun game especially if you play it with your friends."
Meet your Match update destroyed the game. Not worth playing until they fix it.
Valve needs to fix this.
"I was supposed to give this a thumbs up but WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ IS THIS UPDATE??!?!! ITS CANCER    Switch it back to Team Fortress 2, not ♥♥♥♥ing Counter Strike:Fortress Defense"
I hate this game.
A kid told me to go f*** a cactus after dominating him as sniper. 10/10
"[Insert yet another outstanding review for tf2] Wait no, don't.  Not anymore.  Not since the Halloween update gave us no new bosses, infinite appearances of Merasmus and an event version of the worst map in the game.  Not since the most hyped update EVER turned out to be, surprise surprise, just more hats. 10/10 scientists would confirm EotL is worse than Robotic Boogalo.  Not since Smissmas gave us 7 festives instead of 9, and crappy festives at that.   But before then 20/10 would spread my wallet wide for Gabe."
TF2 RULES! LIKE AND GET THIS GAME ITS EPIC! :DDD
"look up, airshot, get ♥♥♥♥♥es  ???   profit "
"This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels.  There are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'.  Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objectives for both teams to achieve.  'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, 'Mann Up', gives rewards upon completing a 'tour'.  In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available.  In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co. Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them.  The game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play. I have been playing since November 2007 and I still return to the game on a regular basis."
"Ive been playing this sense a couple months after it came out with the orange box, and still to this day I love it! With the exception of idiots that every multiplayer game has of course.."
"Look, I'm still going to play the game. It's just THESE that I hate,  -Removed quickplay and thought that the MvM matchmaking style was better. -Still haven't nerfed pholg. -Quickfix was nerfed too hard. Should've been 20%, for a nerf. -Can no longer join steam friends because of the update, and now has to use a MvM style lobby creator. -The previous also disables 'House Call' completion. Really, I mean really annoying things like this, and having to pay for competitve."
The best cosmetic simulator I've ever played. 10/10 would dress up again.
Hats are the Gameplay... 10/10
"Well hello, my name is Esau (ryhmes with seesaw). Ive been playing games for a while, wether its been console or pc or handheld. But there was one game that stuck out for me. It was Team Fortress 2. This game literally made my life what it is today. I downloaded it and booted it up and immediately fell in love. So far ive put over 2k hours into this game and ive made such amazing friends that its hard to believe its a video game. Rayne, Jade, Fluffy, Krys, Reindeer, Walrus, ♥♥♥♥ing noir, and Gawd. You guys in particular have made my life so god damn amazing. Thanks.  But now i have to leave this game. Ive played it for many a good time and i think its time to pack it up and move on. What will i replace it with? I have no idea. Maybe ill fall in love with Overwatch. Maybe ill start playing Indie games, maybe ill go full time CS:GO.  But whatever it is i want to thank this game. It literally morphed my life and i plan to take advantage of the things its given me. I now have a love for my friends and gaming. So yeah. Thanks. Bye."
Its a good game but a bad community and VERY few good people along with it. it is a fun game. but uses a lot of cash.
"Yep. I totally recommend it. Really fun game to play with your friends, but please call it the Hat Simulator. 10/10."
"Now, I see how Valve has made a mistake with the recent update of Meat vs Match, but, (Not to be a Valve fanboy) I'm sure that it'll be fixed, or quickplay will magically come back. Which I doubt will happen, but, The community that is still here is liking the new update."
"This was a very fun game to play until its recent updates that changed a lot about how the game use to be. Either way I am neutral in that regard, but I am giving up playing this in the future because of the changes in time. Happens to every game and every gamer out there. It has the right Free To Play feeling, worth investing time in playing for new PC gamers who have just downloaded Steam. It can have good and bad moments, and it is meant to be a comical, fun and funny game. I respect it. That is why I am putting it on the shelf with a very positive review to this game, but be warned, its a game that everyone plays on PC, there for you will get just about any flavor of gamer out there. Whether mean or friendly, this game is still a fun piece of Art made by Valve for anyone to play. With practice and patience, teamwork and experience, this game is easily a very popular and competitive one out there for anyone to play at the cost of nothing. In-game items are always nice to earn and you never absolutely have to pay for anything. It is earnable, so be warned, patience is a virtue with playing Team Fortress 2. I am sorry Valve, but I wish you hadn't changed the UI interface, and made this game almost just like CS:GO. Either way, the change is not for me. My thanks to you Valve for the awesome moments of team work and accomplishment from this game, it really was a blast to play it. It is for anyone out there wanting to get anything for next to nothing."
"As you can tell from the amount of hours I have put into this game over the years, it gets a HUGE GIANT RAGING HARD ON FROM ME"
"Valve ignores their community entirely. Oh, Heavy is underpowered? His bullet travels 3 feet and then becomes useless? Let's nerf him again! The Phlog is causing a problem? Let's buff it into the heavens! Wow, those are some nice custom weapon skins! Don't mind the amount of work the user did on it! Let's ignore it all! Should we test the update before we launch it? Nah. That'll fix itself. The prices on the TF Market are too high? Who cares! If it gives us money, we're happy. People are outrageous about the matchmaking, saying that one team is filled with F2P gibuses and the other team is with P2P's with thousands of hours! Should we add some kind of balancing/rank system? Naaah, unbalance is fun! Hey, let's put the weakest character in the game (Heavy) against one of the high tier ones (Pyro) and see who people like better! That way we can nerf Heavy even more and make Pyro even stronger! It's balanced, right? People are saying that the VAC system sucks, since it takes 3 weeks - 2 months for a single hacker to get banned and sometimes it doesn't even work... Should we add a new system? Nah, the hacker get banned eventually so it doesn't matter. The community is demanding more weapons from us. Let's add pointless reskins instead!  You need to stop right now. Look at you, sitting in front of your computers, with cheetos and money all over your shirt! Valve, you're dirt to me! Stopping the development of games and doing nothing about CS:GO was painful to me, but ruining this game was the last straw. IT'S TIME TO STOP."
"This game used to be amazing, then someone had the stupid idea to remove public servers, and replace it with a half-♥♥♥♥♥ matchmaking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. They should have just added competitive matchmaking, and kept the rest of the game how it was.   Valve, don't try to fix something that's not broken."
"I've played this game for about 4 years now and I can tell you that this game is one of the best Free To Play games out there but it sucks your money out and you can get scammed really easy,I've been rich in this game once it felt great but it was kinda boring but then I got scammed and I were poor and started it all over it is fun and I'm still trying to get rich(that will never happend but whatever) Now back to the game,It haves a great gameplay and its a team based game,You've to work as a team to win. But be warned if you're new to the game and if you earn the free hat called gibus you will be insulted and be called noob 24/7,No one will like you."
"TF2 is a really addictive and fun game. It's a cartoony sort of shooter and is a must have for any pc gamer who enjoys a good First Person Shooter. It's not serious, like it's counter part CS:GO, it's just a game to relax and have a good bit of fun.   The fast paced action of the game keeps you hooked in enough so that you're paying attention, but not to much so you can sit back and have fun with friends. If you're looking for a serious game where you can try-hard your little panties off, than head over to CS:GO where the rest of the try-hard community (myself included) will welcome you with open arms.  The downside to the game is that not all weapons are available to you immediately, you must either find the guns or buy them from the shop. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE IN-GAME ITEMS, YOU WILL REGRET IT.   Overall I would give this game a 7.5/10 :D"
Nice game with friends :3
"Great game, and it's free so download it. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE?!"
Always worth to try
This new update is terrible. I was in matchmaking for more than 10 minutes and then gave up. old TF2 &gt; new
The new update killed pub games. I can no longer play tf2 'casually'. It's 'casual' mode is literally just competitive with no rewards. I think I will finallly quit this game.
"If you would have asked me yesterday, I would have told you that TF2 is the greatest game of all time. Sadly that's no longer the case. Since the update you can no longer connect to a match. You're just constantly searching. Even if you could connect you can no longer pick what match you join, furthermore you don't even have control of what game MODE your dumped in!! This is a huge step back for TF2. I hope they fix this and recover but I doubt they ever will. Goodbye TF2, it was fun while it lasted."
TF2 WAS A GREAT TIME.... BUT THEN CAME MEET YOUR MATCH #TF2ISDEAD
"Dis is an amazing game, It's a high action blood pumping thriller ride of war. Or... It's a mess of trade servers hats and taunts. Depends on your playstyle."
I can literally describe the Pyro's life.  ~Sun Shine ~Rainbows ~Lollipops  HANDS DOWN. Pyro is officially my favorite. Now Lets go give them some RAINBOWZZ! FEEL MY RAINBOWSS FEEEEELLL THEM AS THEY BURN YOU TO DEATTTHHH ♥♥♥  I would totally recommend this game to anyone who love Burning people with rainbows. :D
Please rename to Hat Collector Sim™. Thanks!
if you havent played TF2... you must have a life.
the best free fps
This game has guns. Obvious rip-off of Call of Duty. Except this game doesn't have care packages       give it time
"After 600+ hours of tf2 ive finally got the time to review this game. Tf2 is a fun game that me and my friends love playing. I recommend tf2 to anyone.  Edit: After 1,700+ hours of tf2, I still recommend it to anybody. Although the recent updates of tf2 have not been nice to some, it still is a great game, after all, it is 9 years old. Don't forget the nice gamemodes like passtime, dodgeball, slender fortress, smash brothers, tf2ware, and many more! There's more into tf2 than you already know."
Don't doubt trying this game since it's for free and awesome! Why are you still reading this review?? Go and play :) 10/10
"I wish Valve would consider working on their own game.  As of now, the game lacks RESPECT for the long time players. I also wish their 'updates' wouldn't all rely on community made stuff, but they do. 99% made from Steam Users, 1% from Valve.  Also, having a broken Halloween event with crap made by the community and last year objectives (which didnt even reset on my end) is not good. Why even bothering making an event? Just because?  As of now TF2 is cool to afk a bit, get stupid drops, smelt metals and trade for stuff of other games or just other games. For the rest, too much aimbot, too much screaming kids, and very little work from Valve.  As always, will update when I feel the product has changed.  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  "
"Competitive seems really cool, but casual mode is really wonky right now. Keep in mind, though, that that we're still very early Meet Your Match update, and Valve is listening to the community and changing things as the update goes along.   I'm very glad that they've removed the time penalty for leaving in casual mode, and that they've cleared things up regarding the ranking system and being able to choose your own maps.   However, am I the only one that thinks that having the timer in casual mode is really odd? I don't know. I just want to goof around on Gravel Pit, not play watered-down comp."
It makes me fap everyday! 72/9.1 -IGN
"The game used to be fun. After the recent update, Valve has divided the game into competitive mode and casual mode. It ruined the overall gaming experience. We have to wait for a long time to join the game unless we play in the community server. Hope that Valve can solve this problem. Otherwise it cannot attract others to play TF2."
"Having played this game for over 6 years now, which 4 of are years in which I played the game competitively, I can't say that I regret anything. I've had thousands of hours of pure fun with friends doing the weirdest and most enjoyable things this game has to offer and I won't forget those times. Being a game that I could come back to whenever I wanted just means that it's worth some respect. Even though Valve didn't fully support the game it hasn't directly influenced my fun(exploits excluded), however even that had it's charm. I have to say that the community in this game was amazing, Valve did exploit it but if they would've released all the updates themselves I can't imagine having a community as it is now. I know people have mixed opinions about the game because of how Valve treats it but when it comes down to it, it wasn't that bad. Playing was fun, trading was fun and everything else related to it was fun, what more would you want of a game?   The only thing I have my doubts about are why random crits are still a thing, it was disabled in competitive, for obvious reasons but in pubs, next to 'helping' new players it made no sense at all. Not for a team based fps like this. I'm pretty sure a lot of people in this game died not because of lack in their own skill but simply because of random crits. Yes, we did get a crit here and there ourselves but most of the time I felt rather guilty than happy.  Anyway, thanks Valve for developing a game that I could enjoy for so many years and the competitive community for changing my life. It truly has been an amazing ride and I hope we can keep going for many more years.  (Made this for the Steam nominations badge :gng:)"
"thanks tf2, that was fun"
"This is long overdue for me. I have played this game collectively for approaching 5000 hours, an unbelievable amount of time (That's roughly 200 STRAIGHT days of this game, yep) and while I am not the best at reviewing I will do my best to give my two cents.  Surely most people will be aware of Team Fortress 2's existance, whether it is in the form of advertisments, artwork, community, the game, Source Filmmaker (SFM), Garry's Mod. But for the selective few who haven't I will try my best to catch you up without any 'spoilers'  Team Fortress 2 is the second installation in the Team Fortress lineage. As of present there are no further games or installations beyond this, however the story is not the main focus. It is the successor to the popular mod for Quake, 'Team Fortress Classic' or just 'Team Fortress', continuing and further developing the lore and gameplay. It is a first person shooter with a charming Cell-Shaded-Like artistic style that makes for a timeless look that has helped the game remain relevant for over 9 years.  While the game offers many modes, such as Casual, Competitive, Horde Styled 'MvM' missions, and many many community made maps and gamemodes, the main gamemodes feature two teams, Red and Blu, fighting for various objectives that each team must complete to win, or stop the enemy completing at any cost.  The core 4 gamemodes that TF2 offer are King of the Hill, where both teams fight to hold a single control point for a predetermined period of time; Control Points, where each team fight to capture the next control point, while defending those they already own; Attack &amp; Defend, where red team must defend their control points and stop blu capturing them for a predetermined preiod of time; Capture the flag, where each team must secure the enemies intelligence from their base, and secure it in their own base, as well as defending their own intelligence; and Payload, where red team must stop and defend from blue team pushing an explosive cart to their spawn and winning.  These gamemodes are made interesting by the choice of nine different mercenaries that the player can chose from. Each mercenary has a different role and stats that can be used in more or less effective situations to benefit each team.  As well as these classes, each gamemode offers a unique playstyle, which is complimented by Team Fortress 2's vast inventory of weapons and unlockables. These items can be used to change up playstyles, create tactics, and allow for countless combinations of items. Each item is carefully tested and proven to be effective, while not so much as to dominate any other weapon, keeping the game well balanced. Combine this with fairly regular updates, even to this date, and any issues are rapidly fixed and patched out.  Alongside the various weapons and items are player cosmetics, which can be used to customize and personalize each players design. There are over 1000 hats, shirts, shoes, glasses, mustaches, beards, badges, helmets, wings and many many more cosmetics in the game that offer next to unlimited customisation, without hampering the ability to play the core gamemodes.  Finally, the game has been supported by many great communities, from small group servers, to large competitive LANs and Events that gather the entire community of TF2 together to recognise the brillance of this game. I could continue talking about this game forever however I hope I have sold you on it already,  If you have the time I would highly recommend trying this game. Even after nearly 5000 collective hours in this game I still find a new way to experience and enjoy this game every time I click play.  Thank you, Dominic 'YouWish' Masters."
The game is fantastic and I can't see myself ever stopping playing it. I play it for the core gameplay and not for the cosmetics and hats.
Team Fortress 2 sets a brilliant stage for its signature brand of class-based multiplayer mayhem.
"The last update literally killed this game for me. The removal of the official public servers together with the embarrassing new Casual mode removed all the fun from it. Now you have to wait five minutes or more in a queue to play a unbalanced match that will also end in five minutes. Unless Valve fix this mess, TF2 will rot in my Steam library."
"Met a lot of great people on this game. Out of all the gaming communitys I've been involved in, this one is my favorite."
i loved this game until the meat your match pyro is already op and he dosent have any bugs from what ive seen heavy really needs an update for himself he has like only 2 taunts by the way he needs to be fixed also i didnt like that meat your match existed it should never have existed i didnt like meat your match update for TF2 will die before 2017 its pretty bad now its updates has been good until meet your match in casual almost nobody knows how to play also its so unbalanced the older days of TF2 was better mvm also has to get another update it has been left behind since its release also i would like valve to release an update for mvm again mvm is ded mvm has to be revived sometime.. well the game was fun until this point also valve GG it was a good 9 years of this game it was some of the most popular games until now well its time to say goodbye to TF2 valve it was good until now..

Gameplay is horrible and poorly made. COD blows this out of the water. The only redeeming quality of this game are the hats. Nothing like scamming 12 year olds out of their virtual headwear and shiny weapons that they bought with their mom's stolen credit card.  11/10 would recommend.
"This game is one of the best games of all time! But Valve is messing it up....  Pros: + many different classes to choose from + many game modes to join + different weapons with advantages and disadvantages + beautiful maps and graphics + cosmetics to design your player + earn steam currency with Team Fortress 2 workshop items which you made + competitive is challenging + humour and funny taunts! + F2Ps are the Holy Grail of TF2 (safe the F2Ps)  Cons: - Valve broke the waiting time for matchmaking - Spycrabs aren't safe anymore - a few glitches and bugs are still ingame for a long time!!! - Valve had to fix some gltiches multiple time to return TF2 back to normal (these cons somehow turned into Valve's cons, sorry) - the TF2 community is angry because of the TF2 Dev Team (fixing the fake bug that The Righteous Bison can hit the player multiple times, do you even play your own games, Valve? )  Phew, that are some high waging cons! :c I'm still recommending the game, but watch out: Valve ruined TF2 with Meet your Match Update!  Thanks for reading my review for TF2!"
Try playing tc_hydro    10.1/10 would confuse new players again
its probably 2nd in my top 5 games of 2015
"Good game really good game,not that addicting and bored for me,but i recommend to play it for everyone who enjoys FPS genre games"
"If you have ever played TF2 on the Xbox, forget everything you think you know about the game. This game on PC is 100x better. It plays better, has more activity, and lets not forget about the items. Those sweet, sweet items that add a whole new level to the game. 10/10 would recommend."

"Team Fortress 2... This game was my life a couple of years ago. The game was booming, the weapons were fun, and the gamemodes were good. But now, oh god. Valve completely ♥♥♥♥ on almost ALL the weapons in tf2. Many vets like myself quit the game at that point. However when valve stated that competitive was coming, everyone got hype. When tf2 comp finally arrived, it was the worst update ive ever seen, on any game ive ever played. You can't choose certain maps, only game modes, comp is a joke, AND to top it all of you can get banned in casual. This game used to be great but now its complete and utter ♥♥♥♥. Hope valve fixes their mistakes. As of right now I do not recommend this game"
"Competitive Mode Matchmaking is    NOT    competitive at all. It's pretty much just a pub which finds 5 idiots to match you with so that you lose XP, and it always tries its best to match an unorganized solo-queued team of 5 Fresh Meats and you against an organized high-ranking team that queued together. I'm not even kidding, I have been matched to crappy teammates for 7-games-in-a-row, it's ridiculous.  Really, the RNG of dumb teammates in Competitive Matchmaking is far harsher than the RNG of random crits in Casual Mode.  If you actually want an enjoyable experience in Competitive Mode Matchmaking, then you are   required   to have 5 friends to queue with so you could enjoy farming XP from unorganized solo-queued low-ranking teams. If you have no friends who play TF2, then tough ♥♥♥♥ing luck."
It's like that one movie where two guys try to make a dead body look like its still alive and well.
10/10 Would fellate random men for cosmetic items again.

Great game! The most fun I've ever had in a multiplayer game. You are always updated with new releases incredible 10/10.
Thought This Game Was Cool
"The epitome of multiplayer FPSs. Free-to-play with a huge emphasis on game balance. However, this game is incredibly difficult to just start playing. There's a steep learning curve that lies within the classes themselves and some unfamiliar game mechanics. The main thing that sets this game apart from, well, any other game in the genre is the classes. Every class has their own unique abilities with only one notable class that I'd consider good all around, the Soldier. However, he has some drawbacks, he's slow to reload, his movement speed is the second lowest. There is no definitive 'best class' or 'worst class'. Each of them have their own important roles and often become less useful in large numbers. The huge variety of weapons is incredible and, in the same respect, can be kinda confusing.  I truly can't recommend this game to anyone who isn't willing to actively learn about it first, as it can be frustrating to not be able to understand the opposition and constantly get called a 'gibusvision f2p'.  Knowing is, in fact, half the battle."
i did this for the sick 'cheive
Can't stop playing it because this game is awesome!!!!!!
Just a game about dressing your character up. There's a hidden shooting mini-game included as well.
"Team Fortress 2 is the perfect Steam introduction game; if you already haven't been pulled in by the fact that this game is no less than zero dollars then let me persuade you. TF2 is filled with clever humour, wacky hats and weapons and hundreds of hours of online play. Even without a premium account you can enjoy all of the weapons bar a few promotional items and have access to any server you choose. There is a class for everyone; whether you like capturing points and intel as the scout, building sentries and dispensers to aid your team as The Engineer or remaining disguised and unseen as the Spy, Team Fortress 2 can provide this along with much more. There are 8 gamemodes in total including Mann VS Machine; not including several spin-offs and countless community generated content. The community holds considerable power in TF2; almost all of the latest updates have been under a strong community influence; including items and maps. Get TF2. Now. You have nothing to lose and I can almost guarantee that you'll have a great time."

"This game doesn't really need any review, it speaks for itself for almost ten years and gets only better with time! Whether you want fight enemies, trade items, capture points, open crates, push carts, wear hats or even create your own stuff, there is a place for you! So, if you're still outside of the most fun you could possibly have online - it's time to join!"
"The game was good, there are items that give you good stat and effects, you'll need to spend/trade to get good item."
Really entertaining game and the Valve team is always making it better with constant updates. Many different game-types for everyone and its all free! I recommend it.
"It was anti climactic to say the least, instead of a thralling game made up of an abundance of original content, valve decided to use the crutch known as the 'fans' for items and cosmetics ripped from other video games."
The best emulator caps
"Truly a timeless masterpiece, no matter how badly Valve tries to kill it."
"Back then it was the coolest game ever, with fantastic character design and art direction, fun and balanced gameplay. I had so, SO MUCH FUN! Cool server mods, awesome community, lots of depth, and a lot of servers actually tolerated micspamming music and dank maymays! Now it's age and evolution have destroyed every bit of enjoyment you can get out of it.   Cheaters are all over the place, grouping up with alt accounts manned by bots, using spinbots, clearing server chat at every frame and namespoofing other players in order to get them unjustly kicked or banned.  The matchmaking system put community servers in a chokehold. Now all there is left are 12v12 'matchmade' casuals ridden with cheaters, premium community servers with pay2win plugins that give actual cheats to whale players, servers filled with cancerous mods and plugins and manned by power-hungry moderators/admins (a surprisingly high amount of them being kids) who ban randoms for whimsical reasons and have a tendency to abuse their powers.  The art direction got completely ruined by cosmetics. What used to be an insane, warmongering, badass soldier now wears pink, flaming rabbit ears, a pink santa beard, a spartan hat and a golden rocket launcher with christmas lights around it... And can also ride a magical broom... Oh dear.  The crazy amount of unoptimized meshes added by playermodel cosmetics gave a lot of weight to the game files and made tf2 run no more on older machines which used to run it flawlessly.  Even after so many years the game's overall gameplay hasn't changed that much. Random crits are still there (unless competitive play, for which you have either to authenticate yourself with a phone (no thanks), or pay (even if you have bought the game when it wasn't f2p ... ♥♥♥♥ move.) Also note that this was done in order to prevent an influx of cheaters and smurf accounts. Needless to say it didn't help at all). The game is still oriented towards zoning, making explosives so powerful that the only mechanic that manages to really shake a game is the medic's übercharge. It now mostly boils down to 'spam a choke point, wait for medic uber, attack, rinse and repeat'. Casuals are a blind spamfest (12v12 in rather small maps, which is way too many players) where tf2's long respawn times kill your enjoyment. Competitive is much better though.  MvM is tons of fun for a while, then quickly gets boring.  And let's just not talk about class balance.  TF2 was the best damn game I had played for a long time. It's first big updates were steps in the good direction, but valve suddenly caved in to greed and added a cash shop and trading, which started the game's downfall..."
"TF2 Died few years back, VALVe were trying to revive it, and to adapt it to any player able to use a mouse/keyboard.. now it's F2P, full of kids, and full of overpowered classes... couldn't find any kind of fun playing it anymore..  VALVe is out of idea, they're picking every single gamemodes they find around and are letting the community do anything with their game like adding new items which have nothing to do with its time line. (was supposed to take place around 1970)  Hope you can still have fun with this game... if you are a kid sure you will... but to me, TF2 is no more TF2, too bad..."
It was good while it lasted  Thanks valve for makeing me leave for another game with an actual good dev that interacts with the community and never did ♥♥♥♥ up the game Now it's just all ♥♥♥♥ing ruined
"The 'Meet Your Match' update is going to kill TF2. At the moment the game is ranging from unenjoyable to unplayable.  Valve, why are you committing suicide?"
Valve's not listening... maybe they never did to start.
"Bring back quickplay mode, quickplay mode is one thing that keep me to play this game. Now with this matchmaking its harder to find a match, have to wait more than 5 minutes to play, even sometimes after long time waiting i got in the server that my ping is more that 200, so i have to quit and queue for more than 5 minute agian. Team fortress is not about winning but about fun, but with the casual and competitive mode its not about fun anymore. you should keep quickplay and add casual and competitive mode instead of replacing quickplay."
"This game was the dank, you are no longer dank. RIP TF2 2016, I am now a happy Overwatch player. Gabe Newell can suck my ♥♥♥♥.  P.S: I used all my earnings of TF2 to buy Overwatch."
"I bought this game when it released as a part of The Orange Box back in 2007-08. I still have the physical copy of the game. I liked it so much for the fact that it lightened my mood as I was not looking for a hardcore competitive shooter. Since the Meet your Match update, it's really hard to play it as this update has taken the fun out of the game. TF2 is not a unique casual game anymore. I cannot join in whenever I like anymore, I have to wait for a long time just to play it. It's really annoying what Valve has done with the game in this update."
"So what can we get from tf2 after the years its been out ?  Hit detection still sucks weapon balancing sucks Hackers still everywhere (cant really help that) optimization still sucks class balancing still sucks voice api still sucks did i mention hit detection ? half the community seems to consist of meme lovers and 9 year olds Also Valve in general for every stupid decision they have made for the game , anyway to milk the cow ey fellas ?"
"  Everything in this review comes from the subjective view of someone who spend nearly 4000 hours in this game.    I know not everyone will agree with this, read some other reviews after this.      If you are looking for a fast paced competitive shooter, look somewhere else.  If you hate unavoidable deaths in an FPS, look somewhere else. If you are looking for a complex team based tactic FPS, look somewhere else.    Note:  I don't hate this game. It is quite fun at the start.  Look below (to the after rant part) for what I find are the highlights of this game. Just don't go into this game, expecting that your time investment will pay off; It is not worth mastering this game! There are other games to master, which'll reward you much more (CsGo or Quake for example).  If you already started playing this game and wonder why I would say this, let me explain:    1.) The core gameplay is extremly flawed and (at the moment of writing) the matchmaking system is utterly broken.   I won't start listing that stuff here, it could and would fill pages.   2.) Valve's staff working at TF2 made the game less balanced and less enjoyable over the years by:   a.) Removing key features like spectating matches on Valve servers, easy and fast drop-in into running matches, vote   scramble and much more...  b.) Adding some new weapons which are straight downgrades compared to other weapons,   with their only advantages being that they are easyer to use and more annoying for other players.  c.) Their balance is clearly based around the casual base, not the competitve league.   Good skill isn't as rewarding as it should be, since the game is balanced in a way to help out new players.     2.1.) It has been this way for over 7 years now, it will most likely stay this way.   Yes I know they added their own comp. and started to work on it,   but they didn't look at what made community comp. work...   3.) The game is very old and you feel it. From poor optimization, to clunky hitboxes (*caught* huntsman *caught*), to year old unfixed bugs.   You will notice this a lot in your games, the longer you play the more it will start to annoy you.  This game needs a Source 2 port, which it will most likely never get.  /rant  What is positive about this game?  It's base design is unique and getting good at all the classes is fun.  It has a lot of good Community Server, with fun gamemodes. A few examples are:  -Deathrun (you might know this from other valve games) -VsHale/FreakFortress (One player becomes a boss and has to fight everyone else on the server) -Tfdb (the db stands for dodgeball, it is quite like that, if dodgeball would be played with an ever accelerating hoaming missle,  that can be reflected, and only ever resets or slows once it blew something up.) -Mge (fast paced 1 v 1 action) -6s/Highlander (Community Comp.) -Many more...  It also has trading (if that is even a thing after tradeholds) and (atleast in the past) everyone could start from nothing and trade their way up... [Warning: haven't traded for over a year and a half, this could be wrong!]  It has a nice Community, well some private servers have.  The Community on valve servers is just as someone who played other f2p games in the past would imagen it."
"Valve makes the game So bad and this will hurt the company i mean The players could find another games to play and Valve will lose many players because team fortress Was/is famous game, Valve you don't think That if you made tf2 looks like overwatch it will be better because tf2 is cusual game, NOT competetive game,  If we made compare 2010 Version with 2016 version you know Which one is the best :P  So valve please Respect Players :P or You will lose them"
"  If you call this fair, balanced and fun, then I'm Wilkie Collins"
I loved this game so much fun. But you kinda ruined the fun for me with this stupid matchmaking. You have to pay 10$ to get into a competitive match to make your team go up. That's stupid #1. STupid#2. IS your matchmaking. ITS RUINED IN MY EYES! Seriously. It was perfect before. I loved that way! It was fun and simple. (BTW I hate the way MVM did it) NOw you made the simple matchmaking this crappy MVM matchmaking system. So yeah. THat's mainly why I don't like TF2 that much anymore. So please bring back the old matchmaking I loved that way. Now it's ruined. Goobye.
"cool game, smooth gameplay and has a great back story"
The game went terrible after the meet your match update. This is stupid. Listen to the community input for a better game.
"This game will make lightning shoot out of your pee hole.    You like shooting people?  You can make someone’s head explode!! Nine classes each with their own way to make someone bleed.   Don’t like shooting people?  You can become a virtual haberdasher and get eRich from selling the ♥♥♥♥ out of hats and accessories.    Playing this game will make your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ day turn on its back side and beg for the D. (Domination for you noob F2Ps.) Play this game today, or don’t, I’m not your dad.  "

"It's ok. game is 9 years old and still going strong, should win the Test of Time steam award."
I didn't have much time to play it but it's alright i guess
Best game ever to play for free. I played the Xbox version and fell in love with it then I moved to PC and found there was more things to do and get. By far the best Free to Play game in my opinion.
The balance and fun of this game is unbeatable. Who can resist it?

"Team Fortress 2. A game with a lot of history and one of the crown jewels of the shooter genre. A game that introduced us to a cast of characters as they fight across the world against each other. With tons of weapons, maps, and fun game modes, TF2 has been the go-to good time game in almost every Steam Account.  However, in it's current state, I could not recommend this game. THe Meet Your Match Update: the hyped update that could change the game for the better, fell woefully short upon release as it removed the valve servers and made everything outside of a community server match making based, and that is broken at this moment in time. Think of it as a crappy version of Call of Duty's matchmaking system except you leave the matchup after every game, hackers more uncommon than before, and bugs that can de-rank you if you do well. Unless Valve does some major damage control and return casual gameplay to what it was before the update, Team Fortress 2 will die as the fans it created will leave it forever.  -This review is subject to change by the creator-"
Writing this while restoring connection to TF2 Game Coordinator.
'Do they make those shirts for men!?' 11/10
Super typical. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ is OP. The pyro is autistic. The heavy is a fat commie. The medic is a nazi. The soldier is the class everyone mains. The spy likes scouts mom. The scout is 6 years old. The engineer is an IT guy. And the sniper is always the newb tf2 player who just came from COD
Best game ever. Ruin my life.
TF is life. Simple as f*ck. Since TFC.

"Team fortress 2, a game that removes all of my stress.  Team fortress 2 is a game that is as great as the portress. You play on various maps, no matter what I always find it hilarious. You play as one of 9 mercenaries from different countries, on each map there is no gap, designed tactically so that every class can be able to kick some ♥♥♥ equally.   If you want you can go scout, to double jump about. With high speed, to fight hard with good dodging, and making them bleed! You can distract a sentry with a chug of bonk from another entry and with one konk from a mate that sentries fate is decided. Or grab the intel and run like hell has broken out in the area for fun.   If scout is annoying and you want someone with a louder shout, you could go soldier the man who is as scary as a boulder, armed with a rocket launcher the results are grandly stauncher! You have multiple banners an trumpets, each with different manners of effect to protect your allies, or boost them to the enemies roost. Or if you're bored, get out a shovel and pulverize the enemy like they've been hiding in a hovel.   But if you want to be a drunken scott, you certainly can and its as fun as being shocked by 1000 electrical watts! You fight with a grenade launcher and a bottle, or a blade if you want to add onto the throttle. Pull out the eyelander and charge'n'targe to pander to your sick barge. Fight your best to destroy whatever pest is attempting to melee fight, because clearly they weren't that bright to fight a drunken man who can stomp you like a tin can.  Or if you want to dawn a gas mask for my favourite class, the pyro spewing fire to change enemy attire into ash, while you laugh and dash in to smash their heads with an axe. A psychopath who doesn't hesitate to unleash his wrath upon the map. Charred and scarred bodies in burning coal mines, which is probably costly in fines. But with flare in hand do you dare to land a critical strike, and extinguish your cohorts while they're burning like a shrike.   Or to easily kill a tankier enemy just become a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, with the sniper a foot blowing heads open from the root, of where you stand which I find very grand. The satisfaction from their reaction and watching the brain matter patter to the ground. You have a smg and a shield to help protect you in the field, but if that’s not enough you got a machete for when things get tough. Or if you're normal you can be very formal, with jarate in a jar you chuck from far soaking the enemies in urine.  Better yet do not fret, pick up a minigun and have a lot of fun. Mowing down the opposition with destructive suppression, enjoying a sandvich whenever you find yourself cornered in a ditch. Though it'd be wise to use it to help heal allies, cooperation is a major key to the enemies destruction. But if angry, break out a tangy steak, and go break an enemy’s face with your fist, each hit spilling so much blood like a huge mist.   Or to become near immortal and quite vital to your teams survival, you could become the medic an interesting pick. You stay close to the group not wanting to stray, with a medigun in hand you run with your crew to ruin the enemy like a bad bowl of stew. With an ubercharge you make a huge barge. Critical strikes or ubercharges for real, which are very analytical when they deal true damage. If cornered don't get bothered get your ubersaw out and cut the enemy like a cat paw, use a crossbow when you need to allow for long range heal. A medical vow which Is very high brow, to do no harm but I laugh while making a human limb farm.  If camping is what you prefer pardner, than look for farther. Be smarter and barter with sentries a lot of kills which fills my heart, watching so many die to my sentries like pennies on the sidewalk. You can help your cohorts with some teleports, teleporters ready to help steady the fight on the front which I'll be quite blunt, is wasted often because someone became somewhat too soften. Building them five steps away from spawn, a major thrive to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ swan. To aid the fight an supply the braid of the team, a dispenser can help condenser the teams health. But again it is wasted like a pasted chain, kept mostly beside the sentry to guard an entry instead of make a fight quite tight. But if its a bore grab a mini sentry and even the score, get in on the combat being as threatening as a gnat.   But if you want to be subtle like a cuttle, pick up a watch and attempt to botch the enemy’s defenses, forcing them to hesitate their offenses. Disguise yourself and chastise the enemy for trusting you, before busting their spine with a fine knife to the back. Go through an odd entry, and sap the engies sentry. When he charges aim your ambassador, like a bally matador and headshot them right on the spot. Before cloaking away to enjoy more smoking while choking the tactics of the enemy.   Gameplay is far from all but let’s stray to a plot, which is quite an unexpected clot. It's very comedic like my relation to a Hasidic, in the form of comics on their website which are very great to some peoples plight, and I enjoy whatever they write, the fact the plot is good is an extra to be stacked on the many pact reasons to love it. The characters are just perfect like a group of barristers.  And with trading that is never fading, you can get other material like games an such which I love a bunch, without it I don't doubt I'd have no bout with any other games to play.  That aside I play it competitive as well I find it hard to get repetitive.   To drop the rhyme for a moment, I have to be honest. Without this game, I'd of been bored so often. And I've met some of the greatest people, and my best friends through this game. No matter what I will love this game, I may have arrived late to the party only joining a few years ago, but I will always be happy to be a part of the team fortress 2 community.    Otherwise can recommend."
"It's the best teamwork-based FPS in the universe, what else is need to be said?"
I like this game.
"Update - Search for game 100 h, lose and uninstall game."
"Damn what the hell happened? I took a brake from this game and i come back to this... dissapointing. Since when was Team Fortress 2 such a strict and grounded game. When i play now i feel like someone is breathing down my neck the whole time. You know i really enjoyed the freedom this game had, before this recent update. I guess things change..."
Had to give up before it broke my life
"this game has rly gud characters dat dolan liek le fast bostonian man le usa army man le schrizophenic burn man le drunk black spiky ball detonator le overweight russian man le engine build man who make shooty gun le german evil doctor man who heal overweight russian man and usa army man alot le outback austrailian man who throws apple juice at other mans le french transparent balaclava business man   and dere is hats also my fav man is fast bostonian man  regards, unkel dolan"
It's perfectly sized to fit in my ♥♥♥♥ for ultimate pleasure. I therefore give it 2/10.  Pros - Anal toys are fun - I can beat my kids with it as well - Tastes like sushi  Cons - I am now forced to wear diapers due to extreme anal tearing and stretching making me ♥♥♥♥ my pants frequently.
Bought this game with the orange box before it became F2P and has to be one of the best multiplayer games I have ever played. Would recomend it to any gamer!
This is a fun game
I hate this game so much  10/10 I play it every day.
"Hats. hats and more silly hats! But on a serious note, this is the best designed shooter this far. Unique characters and playful color scheme makes it easy on the eyes, yet has some skill level one needs to gain not to get murdered over and over again."
"The game has died due to every single weapon being nerfed to the point of being obsolete by the whiny, ungrateful community. Plus the fact that trading (which most people played it for) has gone to ♥♥♥♥ due to the Zimbabwe-esque digital economy in this game. The game has not had a good update since 2012 and the few that it gets are usually a storm of bugs and crappy cosmetics. It's only really fun to play with friends or by yourself on occasion but it has really fallen."
The new TF2 is absolute garbage. This new update has destroyed everything that I loved about TF2 before. I'm so disappointed. Ya'll really know how to ruin a great game... :(
"As of writing this, it has been one year to the day that I started playing tf2, I thought it appropriate to finally write a review on this wonderful game, as a mile stone of sorts. In one years time, I've accumulated a little more than 3,000 hours. More time than I have sunk into any other game so far. The re-playability of this game is something you rarely see in an average First Person Shooter, and its charm is something that has kept its fanbase happy since the games release in 2007.    Some of the things that set this game apart from its rivals is its unique brand of humor, and its beautiful art style. In interviews with the games creators, it was explained that in development, they drew heavily from the art style of beloved American illustrator, Norman Rockwell. In this well thought out game, there are 9 classes to choose from, each with their own unique weapon arsenal, strengths and weaknesses, and personality. Scout, soldier, pyro, demo, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper, and spy.  Scout being a very frail, fast class with burst damage output at close range, he can also capture control 2 times as fast as the other classes. Soldier having balanced health and mobility, comfortably played in all situations. pyro being of lesser health, and balanced speed, allowing him to flank enemies and ambush them. Demo man with overwhelming damage output, lesser speed, and a fair amount of health. Heavy being the bullet sponge of the game, massive health, slow movement speed, and decent damage output. Engineer with the ability to construct buildings that will help allies, and hinder enemies with area denial. Medic being able to heal team mates back up to full health, sending them back into a fight. Sniper having the devastating ability to pick off enemies from a distance, but having the disadvantage of low health, and normal speed. And lastly the spy, able to become invisible, disguise as enemies, and one hit kill anyone, with the major disadvantage of low health, and close range combat.  When it comes to gameplay, this game is about as balanced as it gets. You start out the game already owning all the best weapons, and you slowly earn, or randomly receive items with different stats, better in one area, worse in another. The fact that everyone is given the most balanced weapons from the start, make this a game heavily based around skill. The hilarity of slapping someone with a fish, a ham, or a frying pan make the game enjoyable for more casual players, where as the mix of good art style, balanced weapons, and numerous tournament modes make it enjoyable for more serious players.   On the topic of serious game play, there are competitive gaming leagues from all over the world hosting tf2 tournaments and events. All with special objectives, rule sets, and banned item lists, making the outcome of each game different.  There are several divisions of skill, so even the best have something to work toward.  The economy of the game is something that has a controversy surrounding it. Although this games target audience is mature, young adults, several children find there way in. With so many children actively participating in a global scale open economy, it can lead to unbalances, unfortunate, and sometimes hilarious circumstances. Hats are what make the TF2 economy go around, everyone wants to find a hat that showcases exactly what they want their character to represent. Finding just the right hat, with just the right color, and possibly a special particle effect, can be rather expensive, making most people pour more money into pixelated headwear than is reasonable.   In the end, this is the most interesting, quirky, an beautiful game I have ever had the pleasure of playing. I recommend it to any gamer, and will continue to enjoy its charm for years to come."
The only games that makes me spend money on something that grants me a 1% chance of getting hats that are on fire
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEj81b3kH30 
it traps you in a vicious cycle of killing idiots who just installed the game and feeling good about killing idiots who just installed the game so you do this for six thousand hours and realize you've plateaued and that in the time you've been playing this video game you could have done something good with your life but you're too addicted to the endorphin rush of killing idiots who just installed the game and you've thrown away so much money into a dead game with legit one of the worst online communities there is that you just keep playing even though you know how damaging it is until one day you finally get sick of it and uninstall and give away your entire inventory and you feel nothing because you haven't enjoyed this game in months or even years  but the damage is done and you're never going to get that time back
"Team Fortress 2 is a prime staple of a First-Person Shooter that balances 'casual' and 'competitive' gameplay very well. Since game sessions are fairly short, you can always drop into a game and play even if you only have a short amount of free time.  If you like FPS games, different team roles, random item drops + crafting, and fun, action-packed gameplay, then you will really enjoy this game. As a Free to Play game, TF2 is one of the best of its kind available, and you can play without having to spend any money - it gets very tempting though, especially the more invested you get into the game.  The aesthetics are fantastic, the character models are very well-done, and there is also a lot of detail in the environment. There are a multitude of different weapons and cosmetics (ex: hats, outfits, etc), allowing for huge character customization; however, most of these things must either be purchased with real money or traded (if you don't want to rely on the random item drops). The sound effects are good, and there really isn't any music, so I just play my own in the background. The character taunts and dialogue are great and comical.  The controls are very straightforward and the learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with FPS games. There is a coaching option, where players can volunteer to train new players, and new players can be matched with any available coaches. This is a great option, considering that there is no real tutorial and playing against bots does not compare at all when playing against real opponents. Understanding the different character roles + equipment configuration (different loadouts can change your playstyle considerably) can take some time, but I personally find this part to be very fun. For example, you can equip the Demoman with a melee weapon (each character has a primary, secondary, and melee weapon), and give him a shield and special boots for his other weapon slots - this will effectively turn him into a whirlwind of melee death, so long as you are able to close the distance between yourself and your opponents (swords will give him a charge ability). This differs from his default loadout, where the Demoman can use his grenade launcher and also set up trigger-able mines.  The gameplay is extremely fun, and there are a number of different game modes available - territory control, capture the flag (briefcase), and push the cart (get your cart to the other end of the level) to name a few. The different character types and equipment make for high replayability and can also make each match different in its own unique way. I strongly advise you to try out every character type at least a few times, as each class can be very fun (and complementing your team makeup is always helpful).  The cosmetic items and weapons are fun to craft, and you may be very tempted to purchase a few things (basic items are very cheap on the market). If you don't want to spend money, there are frequent item drops that happen while you play, as well as achievement items that will be unlocked when you fulfill certain requirements.  Overall, this is an excellent game that you should try if you are interested in multiplayer and/or FPS games, especially since it is F2P. If you aren't into those type of games, you should still try this out, since it is much easier for people to get into than say, Battlefield or Call of Duty (again, the perfect blend of casual and competitive elements makes this game very appealing for all types of gamers).  Highly recommend!  Cheers, DJSF  @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "
"THIS WAS MY FAV GAME EVER.  I HAVE INVESTED ALOT OF TIME AND MONEY INTO TF2.... I had a 500 USD backpack, with unusuals etc. Im now selling them as valve ruined tf2.

Hat hathat 2
"This game will steal all your money and ruin your life. From experience, I have clocked in over 1600 hours and spent over $100 dollars on this game. I don't even play it anymore. 10/10"
It gets REALY boring after a while and the competative update made everything worse. sorry :C
Very fun and just great game overall &amp; it's free! Nice one Valve.
This game is really addicting its also really fun.
Funny game and well wroth playing in short just completing somethign to lvl up my Steam Account c:
"Honestly, with the recent Meet Your Match update, the game has only gotten better. Granted, there was a bit of a rocky launch and there are still some teething issues with the system, but to Valve's credit, they've been listening to the community. They removed the Stopwatch and abandon penalties from Casual. They've balanced the Crit-A-Cola and the Quick-Fix, two weapons that were considering massively overpowered in the competetive scene.  The recent influx of negative reviews should not deter you from the game, as with all game changers, there will be some issues that crop up. Considering how much has changed in this update, issues like these should be expected.  Is this justification for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pratices like Ubisoft? No, because the difference between releasing a standalone product and updating a near decade old game with a strong fanbase should be obvious. Valve have made mistakes with this update, and we have seen changes to the game that have reverted some of the updates. Hell, it could even be considered a lifeline towards community servers, as now there's a massive audience of pubbers who miss QUickplay. Now we just have to wait for the rise of pubs via community servers and everything will be hunky dory.  Anyhow, play the game, judge for yourself. I recommend it at least. You can trust me."
Nice game but after last update (Meet The Match) is community dying.  Best cosmetic items and maps are from Halloween. Halloween cosmetic items are displayed only during haloween or full moon which is not often.  My recommended map is Event/Haloween Payload Race map version of High Tower.

Yes Before Quick Play Was Removed No After Quick play Died So... This is what happened I joined a game Then after losing just 1 round of koth.. I lost 4 members on quick play team..

Casual mode can stay but Bring back quick play or add an option like in comp If someone quits the server Everyone can leave peacefully Not just lose multiple time and get your kdr ruined by unfair balance

"I am a Steam user. And this, is a game I play. It took 9 years in development to complete and has countless number of players from almost every part of the world. It costs absolutely nothing to play this game for over 9,000 hours.  Oh my God, the server crashed. WHO CRASHED MY SERVER?!  Some people think they can hate me. Pfft, maybe. Maybe.

"This game defines the Free-To-Play genre .It should be by all means the standard go-to example for any game developer out there that aims to make a Free-To-Play game and profit from it . In any case...the actual review :    The aesthetics in this game are greatly done and the colour pallet is so carefully picked that it creates a unique if not beautiful visual experience. The music really immerses you in the kind of atmosphere the game tries to offer  The gameplay itself is great and it covers any kind of play style you could possibly ask for with the nine classes : the Scout for fast passed shooting , the soldier for tough all purpose defence/offence play style , the Pyro for close range ambushing kind of play style , the Demoman for the indirect play style ,the Heavy for all-out-offence reckless players,The Engineer for strategists , the Medic for the laid back defensive players (though it can be an efficient offensive class too), the Sniper for picking off key targets from great distances and finally the Spy which gives a unique stealthy gameplay to this First Person Shooter .   The huge pool of weapons that exist and are still coming for each of the nine classes makes it all the more interesting and fun .With all the possible combinations of loadouts you simply can not get bored of this game.  There are numerous classic game modes like King of The Hill , Capture The Flag , Control Point and Arena to name a few but the game has a lot of unique and fun game modes like Mann vs Machine (essentially a swarm game mode) and Special Delivery.  There is a lot of content done by the comunity like cosmetic items and very well done maps that encourage exploration and have multiple ways of tackling a challenge .  Putting all these aside the game is very welcoming to new players and very rewarding plus with the implemented weapon drop system you can essentially experience everything the game has to offer without paying a single cent   By all means it isn't perfect but it strives to be and that makes it great .  Over all awesome game ,I passionately recommend it !"
"Almost every time i get bored of it, no matter what i find myself coming back to it. Yes, tf2 the game. Its good, awsome stupidly fun and has alot of things to do and comeplete! So to sum it up, iz a gud'in so install this. BTW ITS FREAKIN FREE AND THERE ARE FANCY HATS"
"Playing since 2008, awesome multiplayer game. 10/10"
"TF2.. One of the best F2P/P2P games out there, its addicting and it hooked me into playing it for hours on end. There are so many things you can do like fight robots, push carts or even collect hats!"
"A great game ruined by being made F2p. It went from a great example of how class-based teamwork is a great thing to a bunch of idiots going around flaunting stupid hats and overpriced taunts. I just played a game of MVM where instead of preparing for the match, they spent the whole preparation period dancing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ conga dance. Every few months I forget why I quit playing this game and it only takes half an hour to remind me. In 2008, I would have suggested this game to everyone. Today? Not a chance."

"This Game Is Tottaly Same As Drugs  You Get Addicted To It And Ruins Your Life But Whoever Addicted To Drugs, He Must Love Drugs Same As Team Fortress 2 THE BEST GAME EVAR BTW : Wastes All Your Money c:  *Sigh* 5 Stars"
"♥♥♥♥ you valve. I have spent thousands on this game. Hours and dollars.  Gun Mettle was really mettling, and I got nothing past a civilian grade skin, and never got field tested or better. I have only had ONE HAT DROP ever. and it was a ♥♥♥♥ing pocket knapkin. I have gone through three computers to even play this game. This computer I'm on can run Payday 2 perfectly at 135 FPS at max. TF2 can barely run for me with everything on LOW. Overwatch runs better for me on max than TF2. A game that's not even a year old, not even half, runs better than something that's nearly 10. The 'Team' that is supposedly only 5 people right now, can't into balance or bug fixing. It's almost like they don't play their own game. The Gunslinger had a glitch where you could punch your team mates twice and hitting the third hit would be a crit. This is intentionl for gunslinger if you're hitting your opponents. But this glitch made it to where you could also STORE a crit and get one hit in on almost any class and kill them instantly. This went unnoticed by Valve for 5 years. Exactly Five.  The Demoman has always been really busted since launch. The man cannot be nerfed. Otherwise he'd be as bad as Medic, who I think is the worst class in terms of how well he is at combat. Healing's great, but have fun defending yourself when you do at most, 20 damage each second while others can off you with 100 damage with each shot.  Oh yeah, and they buffed spy by giving him more speed. WHAT. THE. ♥♥♥♥. Who ♥♥♥♥ing warranted this? Who approved this? Who is testing this ♥♥♥♥ and saying 'looks good to me' and stamps it and ships it with the update?  On top of all this, MyM is what is making me quit. Quickplay is totally gone, and they also removed a bunch of old and useful things like Field of View settings. Quickplay being gone resulted in five community shutdowns and skial, one of the biggest pub providers, to cut down on their own servers because of a lack of players coming in. Hackers are incredibly rampant now despite LMAO Box being gone (oh wait, no it isn't, the top comp player is using and advertising it as we speak). CSGO has better aimbot banners than TF2. TF2 has never had good VAC.   Finally, something that only a few hardcore TF2 fans like. The comics. We were promised a bi monthly updated 6 part comic series, completely new and original and not tied to an update. This was in August of 2013. The second update was in December of the same year. 4 months sure is bi monthly. But of course I could excuse that. There were a bunch of updates that they had made.  But then the next update came up and it was in April of the next year. Then the next update was 7 months later. Then the next update came in 10 MONTHS LATER. Now they're gonna break another record with nearing 11 months within the end of July 2016. They have never given an official and valid reason as to why the comic has not updated. People will excuse it by saying 'what about the other comics? you got those!' Those are guaranteed update comics that are drawn and written by a seperate team.  ♥♥♥♥ TF2. ♥♥♥♥ Valve. ♥♥♥♥ meet your match and the obviously one sided voting system that works worse than Splatoon Splatfest (and even then, everyone gets rewarded for what they do) and ♥♥♥♥ all the recent updates they have made. TF2 is dead to me."
THE BSET GAME EVER
"Hats, and congaing. That's all."
"'tf2 is dead, it's not casual anymore, this update destroyed tf2' i hear stupid people say this becuase he latest tf2 update had a rough start. so what happend-   tf2 got a new major update, with bug fixes , weapon blancing, new maps, a new war and competetive. so why is everyone angry, becayse they have 200 hours on tf2 and think they are pro or something and that quick play is gone is destroying the game, and now have casual mode.  casual mode WAS broken in realase that can i say they have right, but it was broken in the first day, after the realese valve sent a blog post about they know the issues of the game and everthing that happened have they fixed or fixing.  but why is people most angry is just they can not play any map they want and just leave (valve have done you can leave causual mode any time in the 2nd day), but this guys that have less than 500 hours in the game does not know community servers that this update saved, some point aginst community server i don't know any good one, that you can only ask sombody about and 2 point they don't like ads or pugins, every comunnity server does not have.   why i hate everybody hating is because this happened on the first day, people does not time to just wait to tommrow"
"Since 2014 and every single update was a slap in the face ,, and this last update .... Oh man I'm freaking speechless!!  were they serious ?  * tactical facepalm *  Just . ... Just go work on source 2 and make L4D3 , TF3 and HL3 already!!!"
"Want to play with a great community and skilled economy. Play TF2! The game where you could level up your stranges unbox unusuals and even yes even, taunt kill. Yes in this game you can die with style with the medic's ubersaw kill he literally impales you in no time at all. You thought i forgot about this but no i didn't Heavys finger blaster. PRepare to be fingered by the heavy and it will blow you away wit ha stunning killcam. Now i know what your thinkin. 'Your crazy this game cant be that good.' Oh but it can with the infinite number ofhats and taunt you can be the ultimate pokemon master..... wait wrong game. HAT MASTER!!! Also use backpack.tf when in trading cuz it could come in handy in trading. Team fortress 2 is the most updated with over 300+ updates and has been released since 2007 and is still on the top 3 list and is compatible with almost every computer (exept 98) Also the game has an abundance of classes to chose from to suit your playstyle. Scout the team postage stamp everywhere and anywhere, as long as you have aim and bonk atomic punch. Soldier (recomended for newbs) is a rocket launching General and was kicked out of the army for being 'stupid' and has a rocket launcher a shottie and a shovel to dig your grave in. Now for a favourite, the pyro a flamewielding alien with no soul and has 3 weps (flamethrower, shottie, and axe) also the afterburn is op so use it when spies are around. Now for the Demoman an overpowered drunk scottish man with only one eye and can shoot grenade and sticky grenades. Also if your nice he would share a drink with you. with his beer bottle as his melee. Now for the Pootis.. i mean heavy with an abundance of humor and lack of chorus he will sing you to laughter and with his minigun if your mean, also he carries a shotgun and his fists as his melee to beat you down. Now for the engineer a texan who doesnt tell much about himself other than his close relationship with his machines (sentry, dispencer, and teleporters.) he likes to chill and drink beer while his sentry takes up the defendin the point/intel. MEDIC! MEDIC! MEDIC! here we go. this man lost his medical liscence and is a crazy doctor with his bonesaw, medigun, and his syringe gun to support his team. Everyone needs a medic support the team! Now for the sniper the hired assasin workin for the army (sort of) he takes out his sniper rifle and takes out enemies from across the map to sure his teammates safety. He carries a jar of 'jarate' with him to reveal spies in the area so the team is aware or the sniper can take him out with his knife. Finally we have the Spy a man who knows secrets nobody knows he carries a knife and could make a costume party if he wanted to. He can be you or me, he can even be *BOOM*. The spy comes with a knife, pistol, disguise kit, and a sapper for enemy buildings to take out their defences. As a spy you need to stay low so the enemys are unaware of your presence. Just watch out for pyros. Anyway thats my review i love the game nearly put 1000 hours into it and one more thing. MANN VS MACHINE is the zombies mode for tf2. That is all that needs explaining for now i just wrote a book and if you read all this congrats. IF you thought my review was helpful or you want to meet me friend me we can talk about it Thanks for reading!"
"Since the f2p update the game has gone downhill. The latest update shows how much valve cares about making the game even more demoralizing.   A quick rundown on what changed.   - You can't join community servers anymore. - Valve's own servers are having huge ping issues.  - You're basically waiting 30 mins to get a game which gets dominated by one side and ends within 5 mins. - Making new items and getting more $$$$ is top priority. - Gameplay changes seem to be just added into the game without any testing whatsoever.  I once loved the game, everything before the MvM update was just fine but since then I cannot recommend this game anymore. Hopefully the community will bring a wind of change so valve gets their heads out of their (with money filled) asses and do something to get the game into its old state."
"I blew bubbles at people, then I realized that they were NOT bubbles..."
Great game. Tf2 is love. Tf2 is life.

"OH MAN, THIS GAME. OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOH MAN. I GET TO MAKE 10 YEAR OLDS CRY WHILE WEARING FASHIONABLE HATS. WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT."
Ruined my life 10/10
"This game is no longer the same. I remember the good days of getting on TF2 back in 2007, the early mornings, and late nights of just playing on the fun Orange_X and Mario_Kart servers, and there was no competetive aspect to it. You got on to play, have fun. You kiiled each other, you start a rivalry kind of thing with those people, and you just go back and forth for hours. You weren't getting mad, neither were they, everyone was just playing for fun. Just all the precious hours I had put into this game by jumping into a community server are always going to mean a lot to me, but now I find it hard to have feel that same nostalgia playing the game today. Last year I had no problem with the first intro to the comp mode, but that's also because I didn't play it, for I saw no point considering that's never how I played or wanted to play the game, and if I did, I would just go to CS:GO. However making the decision to get on today, was a very upsetting one. Booting up the game not only to see that the old menu has changed, and all the quick play, and servers choosing options were gone, but to see that the whole game itself has become one big competetive mess. I found my way into a normal server, and even then the 'let's have fun' aspect of the game was gone. Most of the old servers I used to play on that I mentioned up top are dead, which is understandable, but I can't help but be so much more than disappointed with the way this game has evolved over the years. I want the old TF2 back."

"Great game to play for free with friends or if you're bored. I don't play it often because I honestly suck more than hookers on the streets. (If that doesn't make sense, its simple. Don't invite me to games and don't send me trade offers. It ain't happening)   I only play if bored or if close friend/family invite me. Buut, if I were to be serious about this, 8/10."
"I used to adore this game holy crap. I woke up for it almost everyday, i could just hop on and press play and id be greeted by really, really, unique people. Plus the fun times after school id just get on and play ctf with my friend and we would just go engineer and ranger relax and watch the enemies vaporize as the turrets destroyed them lmao. Its all gone now, Its not special in anyway anymore. Sure competitive was long overdue, but casual matchmaking? Come on. It feels exactly like csgo and not its own game now. It used to be a game where you could just mess around with the other team and have a hell of a good time. What happened man? Sadly cant play this game anymore. Nor recommend it to anyone looking for a game to play on a normal basis now. OR anyone looking to just relax and have fun."
"Yeah when I play heavy, a lot of stuff goes over my head too since it's such a complex class. A lot of people think it's just an easy class where you hold m1 over the enemy, but they don't understand that m2 allows you to spin your barrel but not fire, which can fake the enemy out. In fact one of the most exciting meta games in tf2 is watching two heavies duke it out, since a lot of times it's really not about aim but about the sheer determination and willpower and how badly each player wants it."
After the update (now it's 8 june) this game is worse then ever.... Takes so long time to join a game... Been playing for 1700.......................
"This game is now 7 years old By rights this game should be relegated to the dark dank corners of the internet played by only a few die-hard geeks with fond memories of the days gone by Instead its now the internets premier hat collecting game, spawned a trading system only slightly less complex that a wall street derivatives trading unit, and added far more weapons, maps, and silly items than anyone can shake a stick at. Yes the game has its faults..... but I've never found any (except arena mode) and its cheered me up on more occasions when I've been down merely by enabling me to set fire to people without the risk of another long jail sentence"

"So now valve isnt trying to make TF2 CS:GO, but it just did. ♥♥♥♥ this, pubs were the one thing that kept me playing."
Got kicked from a game for being in the top 5 scores on my team as a medic because and I quote 'Zeke is going to cost us the game because theyre bad at medic'.  Turns out they lost after kicking me and the kid who voted to kick me got the 2nd to lowest score.  11/10 would be gud again and get kicked to hear team failed without me.  P.S. if you want an awesome medic add me and invite me to play. Im a beast at healing everyone.  Dear TF2 community.  You cannot stop the Putt-Putt.  Putt-Putt is eternal.
"One of the best games that exist ,i never had so much fun online and because when a new major game comes out on Steam, if you preorder it you usually get bonuses for Team Fortress 2 that means it will always be active."
"Okay, I know that I'm late to the party, but the removal of quickplay ♥♥♥♥ed tf2. Casual mode feels more competetive than actual competetive because people don't wanta bad 'grade' on their waiting screen, because they have to stare at their kill/death ratio for 20 minutes. This causes people to go all soldier or heavy so they can get the 'perfect KD' because they cannot reset it. Also you only get to play 1 round before it boots you out of the server, but with quickplay you could find a server on a map you wanted and play for as long as you like. And if you wanted to switch maps, but have most of the same players you could vote for a new map. But to wrap it all up, before MYM I would give tf2 a 8/10 but now it's a 4/10. It's still fun, but valve is making all the wrong choices, no one wants to work on tf2, they don't listen to the community, and no one at valve even plays the game."
Best Hat Simulator on the market. Buy it.  1337/420 - IGN
Good and fun
"All I can say is this. Really? I mean valve, you are catering to only one group of the huge ammount of people who play this former great game. Now I understand that the competitive community has been crying out for this update but do you really have to surender everything that made this game great to achieve this?  Pretty much this update is telling everyone who just plays game for fun to find a diffrent game, because now we're an 'competitive' game and only take serious players who define how good they're depending on a rank in a game. Sadly if that is what you really want there is CS-GO for that.  Now, if you're an competitive person then this game is great, but for the rest of us who work at an office/station/kitchen or wherever and who want to come home, play a game, and have a great time this game is not that anymore.  They're almost punishing the casual players by giving us extremely long loading times and punishments for leaving a game that is consider to be a casual play and not competitive? Where in whoever you belive in did you though that was a great idea? Or lets face it, you where too lazy and just copy and paste the Competitive to Casual and just forgot to code in new codes.  Now, this review is geting too long so i'll sum it up for those of us who are bussy.  Don't Get this game if: 1) You are looking for a fun experience without the worry of ranks, just want to have fun messing with people, or if you want to lay back and have fun. 2) If you are wishing to or even thought about geting CS-GO (Competitive wise it's better according to friends) 3) If you belive games are ment for fun and not for a sport.  Get this game if: 1) You want to face off agenst other players in a organized fashion 2) You have CS-GO but want a competitive experience diffrent from it 3) If you have been in the competitive feild for an long time."
Great game until they made it free
"''Consider yourself dominated, you Scot son of a ♥♥♥♥♥!''  After I heard this line of dialogue from The Soldier, I stopped playing the game. This is the first game ever to offend Scottish people in such a manner. As a longtime Demoman player, I will not stand for this Valve...  Not until you ban The Soldier from the game or give Demoman infinite health, 10x damage multiplier and an unlimited supply of beer. That is all."
New update.
4 years ago.......there was a fun shooter called team fortress 2 and now..... there is conga fortress!!!!!it's like skyrim with hats ~~IGN
MAYDIC!
"TF2 has been going downhill with every update being more reskins and more bugs. With competitive broken along with every other game mode, valve simply doesn't care about fixing tf2 as long as there's money to be made from the 7th reskin of the rocket launcher."

"I used to enjoy this game. But recently Valve has just stopped caring about it. They don't make updates themselves anymore either. They just take some community ideas, Slap it in the game and ask money to have access to it. Halloweens, the best thing about tf2 are just copypaste of previous years aswell now. Exept you have to pay money if you want any of the new cosmetics or missions. Good game went to trash. Sad to see this game go down the way it did..."
"Team Fortress 2 has one of the Best Multiplayer Experiences and it free, it's definitely a must have for your game library."
Bloody BRILLIANT!!!  I thinks thats all i need to say
You can shoot memers and Trump supporters down.

The best prolly
"  Pros:   1. Friendly community  Tf2's community is very friendly, you can easily find people to play and hang on with.  2. Different classes  The difference between the classes is another thing which makes the game as good as it is. You can either play on attack or on defence which makes the game more interesting.  3. Servers methods   One of the reasons for why Tf2 is my favourite game is the amount of the servers and the game methods that you can find in the game. You can either play on a rocket jumping servers, 10x stats servers, Control points servers, Dodgeball and much more!  4. Huge Community  Tf2 is one of the games which has the most groups on Steam if not the one that has the most. You can easily find the right Tf2 group for you by going over the Steam Tf2 groups. You can join a Tf2 community, Tf2 trading community, Tf2 Giveaways group and so on.. Tf2 also has a big YouTube &amp; Twitch communities which allows you to learn from different players and to get better.  5. Team Fortress 2 is Free to play  One of the big advantages that Team Fortress 2 has is that it's a Free to play game. You can easily download and try out this game for free without thinking about the amount of the money that you will be paying for it and if it worths it.   Cons:   1. Team Fortress 2 is getting old  Team Fortress 2 is my favourite Steam game. However, it's been few years since it released a new character. Team Fortress constantly creating new maps and new weapons. However, it's not enough to keep people interested in the game after a long constant playing in it.   Total Rating:   9.7/10 I would recommend anyone which is interested in a multiplayer shooting game to check out this game, you have nothing to lose as it's free to play ;) "
"Always on the first favorite game on my library, First time trying pyro class and got stuck on it! Awesome game for try our Teamwork to win on battle, And have been returned and got bored on pyro class ,head over my pointer to try scout class with killstreak gun and and its my favorite class till now. You can't just go soloing on the arenas, you need a great Teamwork to get in the good place like in the game title. Highly recommended this game at all first person shooter sequel, would try and should try this game! The first thing that you must know from this game is, This game was fully for free to play, doesn't valuable player can win at once you can just start with item drop to be the great one at battle but i'm not.  Let me tell some deep thing about this game, the grapich and texture on the game already at the top points and depend on how far you can handle it. There are two team you can join that is Red and Blu or Blue(mostly called it Blu). Many class that you can wanna be like Sniper, a burner, a medic, an heavy man, a spy class, or as a scout bring deadly itself small shotgun and more class that make you into the core. Many awesome map made by community and official creator, a Crowded server by player and official server make this game more enjoyable for in random gamer community. An stats detail about your gameplay to beat in some records, as much as achievement to unlock beat the average players and meet stranger and be a good team, all is about shoot and some teamwork require to win i need to say again. Few fun mode that you can play, the game always updated, so don't be minded is this game was old and bored, like in other day i check up on SteamCharts, almost got 70K player everyday! An active player every hours! don't think you're lonely, you can start your own story and friendship by just playing this game and be a good person, all will accepting you well. Grab your favorite class and combined item and start chillin with your friend for more fun!"
"A really unique twist on the classic First Person Shooter franchise. The mechanics and how the game plays really is different from other games and is what either makes you love it or hate it. Would definitely at least recommend to try and since it's free, there is no reason not to!"
High levels of Autism.
"TF2 has been going downhill with every update being more reskins and more bugs. With competitive broken along with every other game mode, valve simply doesn't care about fixing tf2 as long as there's money to be made from the 7th reskin of the rocket launcher."
I definitely recommend purchasing this game.
List of outcomes:  Choose Scout: Rekt by heavy Choose soldier: Reflected by pyro Choose pyro: Rekt by hoovy AGAIN! Choose demo: THE DUCKING W + M1 Pyros! Choose Hoovy: Rekt by gibus snipers...&amp; backstab massage Choose Engi: Spys murdered your toys Choose medic: Targeted by all hitmans Choose sniper: Again the ducking spy! Choose spy: SLAP MY A$$ xD
"Gotta love TF2! But my thoughts of the latest update: 'After 9 years of existance, finally you killed the game'   RIP good old TF2 10.10.2007 ~ 08.07.2016  Okay, jokes aside, it does looks cool, but it just killed the original feeling of TF2. TF2 is a place for Hoovies, Spycrabs and Gibus-Engis and i do like to play the actual gamemodes and not only ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting around, but forcing all to play competetive (that is a fact, the casual gamemodes just look like all i have seen from competetive so far, just with more players) is just wrong. Even the XP-System makes it more of a game for Tryharders, who want to show their crazy CoD-skillz in our amazing cartoony-world. Once TF2 was unique and great, but it's adapting more and more to the standards of more modern FPS's which usually don't tend to last long and just die after a year or 2.  Valve, this game has been running really good for a long, long time, don't go the wrong way with this amazing game, i beg you.  Edit 2nd day after update:   Besides all that, the games has now become too easy! I mean just look at the payload gamemode, winning just by pushing the cart further than the point it was hold off at before, makes it way too easy and quick. Valve how could you missunderstand us that much?!  We don't want quick games which are over in just a few minutes, we want long term fun for at least 10min in one game. I mean seriously where is the challenge now? Righ, it's gone for the attacking and the defending team.   I used to trust you valve, for being only the gamecompany that didn't ♥♥♥♥ed up yet. Well done, you didn't just killed TF2, you also killed my trust. (because I doubt that you will bring us our beloved pre update TF2 fully back)"
This game teaches you how to be badass.
"This game is stupid, you can only wear 1 hat at the time."
"This game is my favorite hat trade simulator, the FPS part is kinda lame though (but better than all others)"
"Wow. Even silly old me, who is, like, the most pessimistic, despicable, and downright uncomfortable person to be with in all of history is amazed at how cancerous this game and its community have become. Good thing that you can find out people's IDs via consolecom status and then BLOCK THEM.  Also, great job at microtransactions, Valve. If only you could use that money to, I don't know, fix stuff?  Numerous models and animations have errors or inconsistencies. The engineer still inserts the magazine of his pistol the wrong way. Holding many special melee weapons still looks completely wrong on ALL classes. Grenade launcher still hasn't been updated for the new ammo count. Do I have to say more about the 2-barreled grenade launcher that miraculously holds 3 grenades? Clipping occurs, and is quite visible on the Awper Hand. Lord ♥♥♥♥♥wain's NMCAP:Helmet does clip with ANY other hat. World models of non-stock-weapons are sometimes held incorrectly. Until recently, the red-tape recorder didn't reset its animation correctly - for at least 6 months. Quick-Fix or Vaccinator plus any Medic backpack = Eye cancer.  The netcode has become a mess, which is largely attributable to aforementioned microtransactions, and the incredible amount of content that came with it. Due to this... AddOn-frenzy, the game's code is a very interesting ecosystem. Prepare for two more bugs if one is squished in a patch. Also, lag compensation seems to have become sporadic, and so it seems off for both the giving, as well as the taking side.  Game balance, which was already flawed in the original build, has been purged completely since mid-2009. Rockets don't feel like the long-range support they should be, sentries knock you into the nearest orbit, and the multitude of mediguns destabilizes the game even further. It is IMPOSSIBLE to balance such a content range properly, and attempts to do so have mostly resulted in a fiasco.  Microtransactions/Drops/Trading are stupid, although it impresses me that Valve managed to create a functioning, fictional economy. One with uncontrollable inflation, but an economy nonetheless. Crates and the likes are the final addition of insult to injury, as not everything can be achieved by solely playing the game. This would be a moot point, if keys could actually drop, even with a minimal chance, and if any tickets could be achieved via crates, or as drops. The latest 'improvement' is the addition of skinned weapons, which bring absolutely nothing new to the table. While strange weapons still had some kind of appeal, the megalomania of skinned, customized, killstreak-enabled, collector's weapons is baffling.  Speaking of which: The visual style of the game was very appealing. 'Was' in the past tense, because the art direction has changed for the worse. In-house graphics take on outlandish designs, as seen in MvM, and the inclusion of community created content has led to such things as the... 'Potassium Bonnett'. This completely undermines the original concept of focusing the player's attention on the opponent's held weapon for quick, tactical reactions, and instead causes missed shots and visual clutter in general.  The score is good, if not excellent.    I can NOT recommend this game AT ALL anymore. Not in its current state. Of course you could download the game for its music, but the size of the download could discourage you from that."
"ruined my life, 10/10 would recommend"
"Don't listen to the negative reviews. They're very misleading, and are mostly made by bandwagoning players who sit in spawn and contribute nothing to their team.  The Meet Your Match update may have had a rough launch, but it has become a wonderful, long term improvement to how the game is played. The TF2 community is the only video game community where people complain about people trying to win, it's absurd. But over time this will improve, and TF2's community will definitely be a lot less toxic after the heat dies down.  If you come from competitive shooters, or just want to mess about, you'll absolutely love the new TF2. It's a wonderful blend between competitive and casual play. Several classes are great for casual, careless play, while others have high skill ceilings that make competitive play much more enjoyable.  Hands down the best competitive and casual play out there. My hours say enough."
What's the point of reviewing a free game anyway?
"At around 3000 hours you're too bad to go pro, but too far gone to ever get a girlfriend, so you have to sort of sit there and wonder what are you doing with yourself?  This isn't even fun, it stopped being fun 3 years ago, I'm just playing this stupid 10-year-old cartoon shooter computer game because my activities are limited to crying and masturbation, underage drinking coupled with chronic procrastination to escape my sad, dysfunctional life. I let my life crumble around me and my suicide is only guaranteed as my innate self-hatred eat away my self esteem, and sniping idiots on 2fort numbs the pain ever so slightly.  One day my self hatred will grow strong enough to propelle myself off the top of a building, but until that day comes, I'll be playing this ♥♥♥♥ing game."
"Don't waste your time :/   Kills me to say this, TF2 used to be my favorite game"
"Don't waste your time :/   Kills me to say this, TF2 used to be my favorite game"
"The only game on steam that I have 380+ Hours on....... But when the sh'itty community came, and taken over, then I stopped playing since I was annoyed by little bi'tches. This game was fine until trolling di'cks had to come, pf. I recommend this if you can handle out the pressure with kids... with 7 year olds.. then this is great with you.  LOL.  Rate: 9/10"
"       About this game   Before:   Now:       Performance   At least 30 fps in fights on medium configuration.   Steadily declining performance over the years so I had to gradually lower my settings after each update, as a result 15-20 fps in now pixelized fights.       Load times   Press 'Connect' to hop onto server.   I can brew a cup of tea and make a sanwich while it is connecting me.       Mann versus Machine mode   I have to pay to play with decent human beans, but I can get pro ks or an aussie drop in MvM that I can sell and get my tickets' worth back?   More than 50 tours done, $4 per tour, not a single aussie dropped, all other drop was sold and still I'm down like  a lot  after buying all those tickets.       Community servers   There are some servers in EU zone where I can play with skilled players and mediocre ping and there are few servers in my own country, where players are not so skilled, but still it offers me a sense of team play with good ping.   All community servers I used to play are constantly empty. EU servers get players after it's like 3-4 am in my place.       Valve public servers   I can hop onto any valve public server with ping&amp;map  I  chose and play there for as long as I like. Little to no team play, though, so good luck playing anything except power classes.   I am forced to wait few minutes to be connected to a valve  not-so-public  matchmaking server which will have one of many maps I chose, but I cannot choose just one map because I'll have to wait like 40 minutes then. And I can't set maximum ping, so I'll have to quit few times from 250+ ping servers this thing kindly offered me. And no scramble voting or auto balancing, enjoy being rolled. Oh, and I'm forced to quit a server and stare at 'searching for a server' screen again after playing few rounds. 'Competitive' mode crashes my tf2 constantly and it has only 6s mode, no 9vs9 or HL mode.       Is fun to play?   Depends on the server but overall pretty fun since I either stomp pubs with power classes or play on community servers with decent players.    [salt]What the ♥♥♥♥ is my team doing? Why did my pocket stopped to reload in the middle of my uber? That medic is pocketing pyro and none of them extinguished me while I was afterburning to death in front of them. Badwater defence 1st point, why I'm the only one holding cliff? Badwater offence 1st point, why is my team tries to push under uber from the right side when enemy cliff is literally empty? Am I the only one spy-checking here and I'm not pyro? Why does our medic casually walk through sniper sight lines like it's not big of a deal? [/salt]  Is not fun.     "
10/10 full of racist and offensive people It ruined peoples life I laugh at them
"Infested with Weeaboos and Bronies, would recommend not playing unless you deal to associate with these types of people  Edit: I forgot about the furry population DO NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THESE PEOPLE, THEY WILL SPAM YOU WITH FURRY PRON"
"I have a lot of time and effort put into this game. After 6 years of playing, and how I experience games these days... Wasn't worth it. This game, in my opinion, is horrible. Many people are addicted to it, but if they saw what I see, many would agree. This game is poorly balanced and developed. The only way to possibly have fun in this game is by being those players with tons of expensive items and infinite skill with top-notch computers. Usually these people also take advantage of cheap flaws in the games as well.    Soldier, in my opinion, is the most absolutely over-powered class. I say this because it's always that class experienced players play, since Soldier has pretty much no downsides when played well. Nothing can touch them. Then there are snipers that never miss, sporting their unusual and professional killstreak sniper rifle. Sticky spamming demos that taunt after every kill. Combo pyros, demoknights, so on and so forth. Now everyone can agree that these are a part of the game, but they get rediculous.    The only way TF2 is fun, for me at least, is by actually being able to be successful. Unfortunately for me, I have ADHD and stuff, so that makes it much harder. Especially when there are servers full of unusual-wearing players who absolutely destroooy everything and take advantage of public servers full of learning players. It makes this game unbearable and kills any aspect of fun when instead of doing a role or playing for fun, all you're doing is trying to out-war that one player who is ruining the game. Lately, for me, MvM seems to be the only thing I can consider always fun about TF2, however you have to pay for a rewarding experience. That wouldn't be so bad if free MvM games weren't dead or full of people who haven't yet learned the rocket jumper deals no damage and such. While on the topic, I feel like Mann Up should have tour match ups, so players with few tours only find games with players with few tours, and the same for people with higher tours, since MvM is basically kicking that no tour pyro who's using the degreaser.   I used to have sooo much fun with this game, and I was addicted. Sadly I feel like this game has become nothing more than a money harvester for Valve, since you see things that give profit to them get added 100x more often than something the players have fun with. I understand maps and weapons have to be tested and balanced, though. (Although I feel many weapons have failed their tests and were added anyway.)    My main reason for this review was that I wish Team Fortress 2 was about just what it's called: TEAM Fortress. Instead it is 'Free-to-Play team carried by advanced players' Fortress. At the end of the day, the only people who have fun are the ones who are beyond professional and Valve. Being professional takes time, but some people can't catch up to that point, and it's not fair for new players or those who struggle with the game. I only wish the game was more balanced for newer players and had more about the game itself, and less about hats and Valve's profit.   I miss my old Team Fortress 2."
"I love Team Fortress 2, i really do, but im sad to see that the updates are becoming less unique and turning TF2 into a wannabe CS:GO hat simulator. Every update i supported but now that i have played the game for so long, it just lost its touch of being very unique in a way. Don't let this review keep you from playing the game, but honestly, the newer updates drove me farther and farther away TF2, now every update is about weapon skins and little campaign coins that mean nothing to you, I wish i could say TF2 never gets old, but after a long time of playing, trust me, it does get old seeing the same thing week after week. See you later TF2, you were a good game to me for so long, but now im going to sell everything and go.  EDIT 5/18/16: Mayflower update only came with a case, this is what i mean by 'getting less unique'"
"This review is my opinion only, and should be taken as such. The views held by me are due to my experiences with the game.  Don't bother spending your time in this game. It's unbalanced, has terrible net code, and the community is one of the worst because they can't take any criticism of the game.   I played in all forms of competitive, casual, and everything in-between and the experience always left me feeling hollow. It's not fun to die because a pyro walks at you. it's not fun to die because of sudo-RNG. It's not fun to try and do work for your team only to discover that you are the only person that's not a sniper or spy.  I used to enjoy it but it has grown to the point where it plainly infuriates me. If you don't have any other games, go for it, but your time would be much better off spent on a better game."
"Gun Mettle was ok. Invasion was meh. Tough Break was also meh. Meet Your Match was trash. Hitscan is still garbage. Competitive MM is an actual joke. (Even after spending months in a ♥♥♥♥ing beta...) Valve are still lazy ♥♥♥♥s only motivated by money. ...and VAC is still a ♥♥♥♥ing meme, despite doing its job slightly better lately.  Somehow this poor game has survived a decade even with the most hopeless possible devs. I do not envy the people who still try and legitimately enjoy this fun little shooter. But honestly, it was fun while it lasted. Rest peacefully, TF2.  Oh and last but not least:  ＧＥＴ ＧＯＯＤ, ＧＥＴ ＬＭＡＯＢＯＸ ⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻ ╔═══╦═══╗░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  ║▒▒▒║▒▒▒║░██░░█░█▀▀▀░█▀▀▀░  ╠═══╬═══╣░█░█░█░█░░░░█░░░░  ║▒▒▒║▒▒▒║░█░░██░█▄▄▄░█▄▄▄░  ╚═══╩═══╝░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ ⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻  10/10 would cheat with a $600-$700 Sniper load-out again :^)  Stupid badge making me do this garbage."
Probably one of my favorite games of all time
"Very unique fps shooter, Provides hours of fun, and also has the best hats than any other game."
AMAZING GAME! You dont even need a good computer to run this game. ive had almost 190 hours on this game and i still am discovering more and more to this game THIS IS A MUST HAVE!
This is great game the Grafics are awesome and its he only thing I do on my computer (apart from homework)
Good game  BUTT  U need Money to get full exprience
Old But Gold
One of the best Free-To-Play's i have ever played
"What I think of the Game: Its alright I guess, I mean there are some flaws like hackers and such. But its not bad really. Its basically for anyone. To all the destructive people out there play as the Soldier or the Demoman or the Pyro. For all those people who love to help out to be the team player, play some Medic or Engineer.   A little story I wrote for Team Fortress 2. Once upon a time, a little boy named Jimmy had finally got himself playing some 'Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2' and he said to himself. 'Gee, I wish people aren't so mean and hateful of other people!' and so Gaben flew into little Jimmy's window on a unicorn with laser eyes with armor made of Chuck Norris Beard hair, and so Gaben took little Jimmy on an little adventure into the world, of Team Fortress 2. He showed him ctf_2fort a magical place to live (if you are a maniac who has a barn full of guns.) and he showed him the magical-ness of Team Fortress 2. Little Jimmy couln't believe what is going on so he fell asleep and the next morning he gathered all his lunch money and bought himself so many hats he became! A hat lord! Something truely amazing!(Not) So he went on and bought even more which made Gaben very happy. The End  Basic Steps: Launch Team Fortress 2  Get on a server  Buy hats  Buy even more hats  Rename Team Fortress 2: 'Hat simulator'  Give it the 'Game of the Year award' fifty times  Eat  Sleep  Play  Anyways, to be mature about this.  Team Fortress 2 is a wonderful game which players can interact with each other. Either by relentlessly murdering them or just giving each other high fives. It has many game modes like Capture the Flag(Briefcase) or Control Points. It really gives players control over many things. There has been other things like custom community content or Mann vs. Machine. It also has many abilities to make players smarter. Each class requires you to play differently everytime. I would recemend Team Fortress 2 to many people. But I don't have that kind of communication. Although you'll first end up as a Free To Play you'll soon invest some cash into the game. Word of advice: If you get the Ghostly Gibus, Throw it away. People will criticize you for it. All of all things enjoy the game don't just mess around, time will fly way past your head if you do. But you might find yourself addicted to it after a while.  That has been my review hope it helped you!"
"The only game that if you are terrible at it, you probably always will be. Love it so much.  Everybody must be squealing with delight about the fact that it is FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 10/10"
Amazing just flat out awsome.
to cool 
Tf2 is a good game( if u like 1st person shooters) becuase u have all these different verieties of classes and weapons  I do recomend this game to peope who like to play 1st peron shooters. 
10 out of 10 game
Spectacular game. Reccomend it for everyone
dis game is dickbutt
"I don't think much has to be said about TF2. If you haven't played it, you should! It's f2p after all so you have nothing to lose. Besides, no one can resist the most hyped hat simulator ever existed! ;)"
"Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is one of the most popular games ever, especally in the FPS (First-Person Shooter) catagory, there's 9 Classes to play as, all with diffrent playstyles, peranalitys, weapons, or something funny to say, in genral, TF2 is a must have, if your on a computer you own, there's absolutely no reason to NOT own this game."
"heaps solid game, lovin life at its finest"
I highly recommend it is a beautiful game :D
this is hat simulator more hats than weapons in call of duty and battelfield has weapons and its all about the hats and the golden frying pan and this game is aweeeeeesome the best fps game eveer
An absolute amazing game to play with your friends. a 10/10 for me.
"I love playing Team Fortress 2. The amount of items you can get, customize your characters, find strategies to defeat the enemy team, and acton-packed fun! It's like Call of Duty, but way better! Also it has a great cartoony texture!"
Cool Game!
Best free to play game ever. 'Nuff Said.
!
The best FPS ive ever played
"After over 800 hours on this game, I still go back to it all the time. Both being free-to-play, and easy-to-run, Team Fortress 2 has been the game that I grew up with in both FPS's and video games and general. There are so many different gamemodes, so many different things to do, I will never get bored of this game, and reccommend it to absolutely anyone."
"Spent all my money, lost my house, wife, and kids. now living under a bridge feeding off of McDonalds WIFI. 10/10 would do it agian"
A game where you can shoot and taunt at your enemies at the same time.  Where you can wear hats that will define your level of skill hats =/= skill
"This game is no question, my favourite game of all time, in the universe. And it's easily, the best Team Based shooter, ever to be created. Will you enjoy it? Don't let me be the judge of that, this game is 100% FREE. Go ahead, download it and try it out for yourself! Hate this game because the graphics are 'unrealistic'? To me, that's why it’s so lovable, and contributes to why its survived for so long. Micro-transactions from the Mann Co. Store aren't necessary, and items like Hats, Australuims, Unusuals etc- aren't needed to be good at TF2. I'm not to dis trading however, it's something you can use to your advantage and profit hundreds, if not thousands of dollars, I certainly have! And you can utilize the Steam Community Market to get Funds when you need 'em."
"This game is 1 of it's bests and so I will like it. Why?  1) It's one of the best F2P(free-to-play) games ever created, because the concept of this game itself is just great.  2) This game is not as PTW(pay-to-win) as any of F2P games that I have yet encountered.  3) It is really a game that is build on cummunity and is great to play with friends, really... almost every item here from now included is made by community.    I hope my comment to this game 'Team Fortress 2' was somehow usefull, if you think I was wrong at some point please contact me. Have a nice day. Bye.  THANKS FOR READING"
This Game is so gud &lt;3
"Great Game, Fun, Interesting, and also great to meet new friends."
Catching Game! :D
"A very nice game with silly stuff, cartoony graphics, lots of things you can do and just general fun! 8/10"
"This is a great fps game. It has a cartoony feel to it which is not very common among most first person shooter games. However if you have played games like COD or other games with guns, be aware that this is nothing like those. It has specific classes with set weapons, all classes have weaknesses and strengths. Not recommended for people who like to play offline either as the training games are not the best."
Tf2 is a fun and enjoable game it gives u options what to do on it Play the game or trade i like to do both but mostly trading.
i highly reccomend it
This game is soo fun and i cant stop playing it.
this game is so much fun with friends 
Motherf*cking Hats!
I played very little time but enjoyed all of it. 100% recommended :D
this is awesome game everyone should play this and if you make a new one that would be great
This is my favorite game above all others. Get it. Play it. Wear hats.
"Excellent game. Allows for accurate gameplay with low graphics settings. Plus it's free, so anybody who is unable to afford a high performance computer can enjoy this gaming just as much! 10/10"
A lot of fun Nice customization  MORE SKILL!!! MORE KILL!!! HATS FOR THE HATS GOD!!!
Its an Fantastic made Game full of Amazingness And its very addictive
Spent so long on this game over the years never gets old
reall fun i recommend this game hope you try it out 
This is by far my favorite shooter EVER.
Best Free to play game to date.
"Don't even get me started on this game. I was introduced to it back in 2012 and since then I have never looked back, unbelievably addictive. Team Fortress 2 is one of the most well optimised, consistent performing and superbly balanced games I have ever played and has no Pay to Win aspects at all.  A person who has had FPS experience on computer can pick up the Sniper on the first day of playing the game and come top scoring in a pub, this game is so simple and complex at the same time which is why it is so much fun!  If you don't play this game more, and have passed it over as another of Valve's ploys for money, seriously think again because unlike what most comments say this game is MORE than just hats.  TF2 has teamwork that is unlike any FPS I have played and puts COD and even Battlefield to shame as it is ALMOST impossible to lone wolf in this game. Even the pro snipers can get crowded by sphees or gibus scouts and get killed... nobody is perfect.  GIVE THIS GAME A GO THOUGH, just... don't go full ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and at least learn what things do by watching videos before playing. Don't be that spy that stabs the sentry ;)  Also, PLEASE GO MEDIC IF YOUR TEAM DOES NOT HAVE ONE!  10/10 :D"
Very fun. Its an amazing game. Even better when you play with friends!
"oh man!, Team Fortress 2 is an amazing game! so many different weapons to find an unlock and find. cool easter eggs and secrets. the achievements, all 500 or so. all the amazing servers and people you fight or kill, some will even friend you or trade or give you gifts."
It's okay. I hate Soldier the most.
I recommend this.
"this game is awesome. you can trade people for more weapons, work as a team, find items or just enjoy yourself! even if your f2p (free-to-play) you can get a lot out of this game. 5/5 stars no doubt."
"The only game you really need on steam. It's also free to play? Wow, can't get any better than this."
"Easily the best game ever made. What it lacks in finesse, it makes up for in stunning graphics and high-stakes, tactical gameplay."
"REVIEW OF 2015: 2015 was a good year for TF2. It was a good recovery from 2014, which wasn't as good, with its Halloween and End of the Line updates not being top notch, and the Smissmas update hardly adding anything. 2015 brought Contracts into the game, where you get given 2 missions every week that you must complete, and you get loot as a reward. Most Contract Campaigns required you to pay up 6 dollars, but it's totally worth it. It gives you something to come back to the game for. Also, they added at least 4 new maps with every major update, whereas last year they didn't give us any maps. 2 of the maps included were left out of previous Community Updates (End of the Line and the more recent Invasion update). This year also brought a lot of balance changes, and the game is almost completely different now. You can also pick weapons off of the ground, which you can use for the rest of your current life. Also, of course, weapon skins and weapon cases were added. You can inspect weapon skins in-game and you can also get them in Strange and Unusual qualities, with a new stat clock on the Stranges and new Unusual effects. You can also unbox Strange Unusual hats and weapons, which are worth hundreds of dollars.  In my opinion, the most lacking update was the Invasion update, but that doesn't mean that it still added some cool features. It added a bunch of new special weapon skins with unique models, and 4 new alien-themed maps. However, 2 of the 4 maps were not added to the normal servers' map rotations, because one of them was a new gamemode and the other was an old gamemode that doesn't run on Valve servers anymore.  The best update was the Gun Mettle update, which was the first update to have a contract system. While the skins weren't as good looking as the later Tough Break skins, it was still worth it to try and get them. This update also included a lot of balance changes, and the ability to pick up weapons. It also added 4 enjoyable maps, 3 of which were made by the community: Borneo, Suijin, Snowplow and Powerhouse.  And also, the rumours of Matchmaking. Now, Matchmaking is currently in Beta, but last year it was all the gossip. Lots of hidden files were being added which gave info about Matchmaking.  Overall, I give this year 8/10."
Pabu is very adorable  Pabu likes this game  Pabu thinks that you should play this game.
"I hate my friends for getting me into this game. I thought, 'Oh, good; a free game. Perfect for a broke college kid.'   I've never spent more money on a game.   Need those hats, man."
"Well..I bought the game years ago when it was sold on a disc. i was like in elementary school and i enjoyed the game. But then i kinda stopped and lost the activation code for it. so i couldnt play it. But Lately I saw it was F2P and was quite excited. To see that VALVe has kept a F2P game up like this, is impressive and is one of the reasons why VALVe is my favorite Game company. This game is great and will be for the years to come. Thanks for the great game"
a good game with cool graphics
gud game but the update that just happend was teribble
It's a okay game I suppose.Some people like to joke how the futhure of Team Fortress 2 will just be a Dancing Simulator 2017 but...well actually that MIGHT happen. But if you like FPS games and you have no money...it's a great game.
"Fun game, God awful community. Definitely worth playing, just ignore the riff-raff."
"When I got this game, I swore I would never spend a single penny to buy anything and just be content with the loot drops. But then I thought 'maybe I'll get something worth a couple cents just so I could get a premium account and have more backpack space' and later on, 'Damn I have a lot of crates and I need to purchase a key to open one. Maybe just one. Or two.'  And now I'm an active trader and have bought a bunch of keys for metals and taunts and weapons and most importantly hats."
Very nice game :)
"This is a good game, Hats, Guns, Classes, You know.  But The Scream Fortress Update Has Been Quite... Bad To Put It In A Polite Way.  The Halloween Transmute Is Neat And I Like It, But The Merasmissions Are A Pain, They Reward You For Going Off The Team. Honestly, They Are Bland And Boring.  I Have Also Been Getting The Exact Same Mission But On A Different Map, Kill  100 People Basically, It Is A Pain In The As$ And After All, You Get A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Hat. The Taunts, Hats, And The Boost Of Unusuals Is Quite Neat.  This Is Just My Opinion, Bye."
"Alright ♥♥♥♥ lets talk some serious ♥♥♥♥ right now at this point at the state of team fortress 2  I have been playing tf2 for nearly 6 years now and i can say out of all the putrid, garbage updates that valve has decided to ♥♥♥♥ out, 'Meet your match' takes the ♥♥♥♥ing cake at being the most autistic hundreds of lines of code that has ever been typed by a human being  Devs think this game is a competitive game when it isnt. They've basically dropped the tard hammer on this game and taken out the casual part of a casual game. Probably the most barbaric worthless ♥♥♥♥ I have ever seen be dumped onto a game, and that's saying something when diarrhea such as Rockstar's customer service desk exists out there.  If you're looking for a casual game, you're like a vulture late to the party. Everything has been picked clean and it's just a carcass of a game now.   Too bad i missed playing this game. Hope Valve understands their autistic decision and reverts it back to an earlier version."
It's Ok Game.
"It was really good, when I first played it and it was a bit addictive as well. Sure, there are minor things that either don't make sense (like the recent damage increase to the Widowmaker) or negative ones. But in the long term, this game is about strategically completing certain goals and, unlike other shooters, encourages people to either go or lose with the crowd.   I definitely recommend it."
"A very fun, very original, very breathtaking, Hat simulator."
"U have not got this game? UR ♥♥♥♥ING INSANE! It's the best FPS shooter i've played, ever in my life. The only downside it's starting to become moar of a hat simulator than FPS, but I dunt care. Whatever, It's free, but I am not so keen on it. Overall, IT'S JUST SO AWESOME MAN, ♥♥♥♥ING SHAME ON YOU IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS GAME GET IT NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW!"
i play this more than i sleep
Pretty decent point and click adventure. Needs more ducks.
"Okay Here we go.   After a long time having the worst review in the world for TF2.  It is finally time to make a better one.  Team fortress is in my opinion a great game. Although i got a bit tired of playing it so much. So i got into trading more and more (which is also quite fun and challenging). Now this game has become sort of like an endless fashion day. Letting people see how much stuff i got and of course telling them how much it is worth is a real gust of happiness. (Although i have to fight/trade f*cking hard/much to stabilize my income and loss(F2ps copy these words into your mind : Earbuds,keys and refined)  My favorite gamemode: Mann Vs Machine. Why you ask?   Well i've always loved games where you can upgrade your weapons + It is a lot more teambased (You must work together at any time. In a normal gamemode like payload people can just go out on their own and randomly try to kill people and do nothing for the team.)   Tip for the newcomers: Try to find out how you can talk during game. It will save you a lot of kicks and deaths.  Thanks for reading.  -Cantreon"
IM ADDICTED TO THIS GAME
TF2 is BY FAR the best hat simulator in the world
The most fun you can have on Steam! First-person shooter (sometimes Third-Person!) Craft items! Get 7-17 items every week! Trade with people! Make Friends! It's all here for FREE!!
"Time eater but you know...good rounds with friends ,some tech actions ,etc. :)"
"It is a very good game- Violence, humour, variety, hats, Guns and multiplayer matches! Only downside is that it can have very poor connection and crashes frequently. When you are connected, it becomes fun, fast and fantastic- 8/10 Stars "
ive spent about 2 years on this game had a blast wont be playing it for a while tho it became my most played game/most loved game to a game i might uninstall soon it just got really bad i mean really really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the new update is a ♥♥♥♥ing nightmare went in saw the new update i got so happy that i was going ♥♥♥♥ing insane go in and i see all this new looking ♥♥♥♥ that got me even more hyped check whats going on i start to get a little bit concerned than i get angry then mad then i go ♥♥♥♥ing abshit i try to calm down for a little bit i wait 20 minutes im starting to get angry again i stop searching for a normal game go to mvm wait 20 minutes than i decide im gonna ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ gabe then kill him i hope everyone who made this update gets a rusty nail up there ♥♥♥♥♥ valve you ♥♥♥♥ed up you ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ed up you ♥♥♥♥ing morons until the game has gotten a GOOD update ♥♥♥♥ this game
"A true shadow of its former self. Tried and failed miserably to create a competitive scene for the game while removing the pubs and replacing it with competitive lite mode. It's like if you tried to mod an iPhone to run Android, you just end up with ♥♥♥♥.  Bring back pubs"
Im so glad this game was on sale for the 2016 steam summer sale I have had my eye on it but it was to expensive but now I can afford it. THANKS GABEN!
"i love this game it is my favourite game at the moment, i would strongly recommend anyone to go ahead and download it"
I love turtles. I like this game. That should be enough information to persuade you into getting this game. Goodbye.
amazing and very addictive definatly recommend 
Even after 7 years of playing the game still remains fun! Must buy for FPS lovers.
"Ok so, TF 2 ...... What I can say about this game..... just few think... I LOVE IT . You can play it on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computers. There is a lot of a new modes. Like medieval etd.... Good community ( 50/50 ) . Good variety of weapons, classes. A competitive mode coming to this game ( Official version ) .... Its a great game, and every FPS player will grow in this game ..... But they dont add a new weapons ( New weapons are actually hard to balance. But you can give a time and do it ) New updates including map fixing, fixing bugs... Sometimes a little nerf to weapons ( Weapon changes and Maps coming only with a BIG UPDATES. Like Tough Break etd.... ) . But most of a new updates just including cosmetic items, cases.... And if u wanna have some weapons as a free player. YOu need to 'grind it' and dont worry. IF u will pay for a premium. You will get a chance to drop a hat. Thats all..... BUT HACKERS. In this game, valve dotn give a ♥♥♥♥ about hackers. Yeah, they ban big hack named LMAO BOX. But that hack was UP 2 years ? And they fix it NOW !   Pros +  +Good community +Tons of playstyles with weapons +Funny game, dont take this game srsly +If u asked somebody for help, they will help u  +U will learn in this game, how to aim. Its good for a start + There is a tons of pros in this games..  + Funny game events, like halloween + Good coop mode, its really FREE TO PLAY GAME + You dont need to pay to this game to have same fun as a premium players + Friendly peoples, you can see. Enemy players playing heavy, they will give u sandvich and taunt with u . JUST DONT KILL FRIENDLY PLAYERS + A lot of moded servers ( The UnderWorld of TF 2 )  + A lot of maps are created by a community + The community is not that big, because OVERWATCH.... But still, its a HUGE + This game is not just 'community created' game +Funny videos, all meet character videos are great + This game dont take anything srsly. And thats great. Its just a joke, EVERTHING IN THIS GAME IS JOKE + Some hilarious bugs, like ur arrow pierce enemy to wall. And stuff like that   Negative -   - There is a lot a skill players, and two peoples who just coming always with u. One with medic and one with soldier. They will destroy your fun on a server if u are new - Sometimes, you cant say if that player cheating or he is good - You need to grind, some weapons ( You need time, to craft it , and stuff like that ) - If u will start to playing this game, you will lost a life - The most curse of this game are try hards , like M1 + W pyros with bb and stuff like that - There are peoples, who killing friendly peoples ( that try hards ) , RUINERS OF FUN - Developers adding just hats,skins etc. No free weapons, modes - Bugs, there are a maps. Where u can get under the map without problem. They dont fixing it - If u wearing a free hat ( Gibus ) nobody will likes u. Everybody will call u gibus idiot etc. And thats true, every player who have gibus is a BIG TRY HARD - No real balance, there are still OP weapons , what dont need skill ( Force a nature, Huntsman ) - Random crit system. it is positive but at the same time negative. There is a chance to get 100 % dmg boost for a few second. Its RNG . If u are friend with TF 2 GOD GABEN. You will get non stop random crits - A lot of maps are by community, not by developers.     I dont say everything, there are a lot of + and - . But I highly recommend this game . ITS A GREAT, YOU WILL LOST LIFE BUT WHATEVER. If u wanna start playing FPS games. Its great for start. Every FPS player grow on this game. And me too. I know , I have only 841 hours. I know, But I have my life. And I will say... YOU NEED THIS GAME. Its a great. So rating ? 8/10 Why 8 ? Because, OP weapons dont getting nerf. And if they do ? It take years , before they will nerf it..... And not a new concent. Few new maps, changes . But not a new modes. Like for medieval, do more maps . I concent is from a community. What is not bad. But just, developers. Do something too, you just doing balance changes. Whats not that easy I know. But still .... I will get massive hate for it, because I am giving 8/10. Its a BIG 8 , nearly to 9. But this think are just really stupid. And cheaters are really big problem. But I think, I am giving this game a year and It will be 9 or 10 .     "
Creative yet simple. A different fps. One of a kind. Definitely one of the best fpses ever made... maybe even one the best games ever made. Plus it's free. Highly recommend it for anyone who wants to make the most of their game time.
Great i play when ever i get the chance this is truly a good gun game
"Great fun, great community, and truly addictive. Varied gameplay and unique game mechanics make it in my eyes one of the best  free-to-play  games ever made.  Honestly, when I first saw this I thought it was a terrible cartoon shooter, but 500+ hours later, it's amazing.  If you don't have it, get it.  NAO"
"-Hone your skills in both PVP combat, and PVP economics!  -Master the art of the rocket jump!  -Use broken hitboxes to decimate your opponents!  -Grab your friends and form your own elite team in 9v9 Highlander!   Pfft yeah right, I have 3000+ hours in this game you really think I have 8 friends?  "
"Really fun and addictive game, simply a classic."
This game is pretty epic! Its cartoonish look is great and all the characters are great i pretty much recommend this game its really nice. 
This Game is super amazing for a free to play love it so much
"A fun, casual game with some aspects of competitive. The addition of casual and competitive game modes really added this to the game. I personally play on other game modes including surf, jailbreak, and other modes that I believe really add fun to the game play."
Very fun especialy with friends also it free to play and runs on most hardware so love it
"Ah. Team Fortress 2. Team Fortress 2 (or tf2 for short) is a cartoony shooter game. Now don't judge it like that. The outside may look silly, but the gameplay is pretty big. There are 9 classes in the game. Each class is diferrent so you probably have your own favorite. Most of the game is playing game modes but there are also fan servers with fan-made gamemodes such as deathrun, randomizer, and prop hunt. Thats not all. The weapons are all different and are very well balanced. Thats not all. For advanced tf2 users you get to start entering the world of trading. I'm not going to get into that. Tf2 is very addicting in every way. I will recommend it to anyone. Try it for yourself!"
You will have a great time!
Probably 1000000 reviews on this already but... Fun by yourself and even more fun with friends and dont get me started on the complex trading system
Its one of the best games in steam!
A very nice and fun game! Might even give us community to have a chance at making nice submissions :)
  10/10 Unique from other shooter games.
  +It's really Free-to-play +Many different classes +Lot of weapons +Easy tutorial for beginners +So much cosmetics +Good gamemodes +Community updates and servers +Support for players  -Lot of cosmetics are very expensive -A small selection of weapons - 8.7.2016 Meet your match update* -Some bugs  *Fixed
"  I'm playing a round of pl_upward and I'm on the Blu team, maining the Soldier. We're easily capping the first couple of terminants with the third giving us a bit of a struggle before we take it over. As we reach the final point...  I get instantly killed by a Gibus Scout who got a random crit, get autobalanced onto the red team with 60% of the opposing side sitting AFK in the spawnroom and the winning team I was just on win the round and slaughter everyone including myself, who was still trying to catch up on what just happened.  On the plus side, I found the Hornblower, so I guess that pays off."
this is good game ever ^^
TF2 is better than Overwatch B)
  This game is very op if you want something to entertain and do not ask many requisios I recommend this game besides the minimum requirements are not much to speak my pc is worse and I do well in the game I recommend this game to pass the time or to fun
"It's good, the community should create more content then publish it :P"
10/10 Easiest way to make money off a game
I love TF2 so much! I thought it was a dumb and stupid game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphic and dumb characters but i gave it a chance and regret everything bad I said about it. I have fallen in love with this game and look foreward to each match I play in it! The community around the game is also very friendly and helpful and just over all amazing!
No wonder why i got no gf's...
"Very well made game.  TF2 is a quite unique FPS game that is hugely made for the idea that you play as a team,as the name suggest as a matter of fact,this game truly is just addicting for its 9 completly different classes and not to talk about its maps,quite a few gamemodes,weapons. I completly reccomend this game for it seems to just pull me to play it every day.  And hats,don't forget hats."
"Hellow people,  This game is a realy nice and AWSOME GAME. its funny you build up Skills. you meet awsome friends. There are incredible nice hats (i dont have one yet :( ) the classes are good too. If you dont know if you wanna download this game. JUST DO IT ! Its totaly worth it, i got over 800 houers and i still love it.  If you wanna know more about this awsome game just send a friend invite and i will help you.  JUST DO IT !   Sya guys later, and have alot game fun,  BlockBeamer"
"Waddup, your boy LeX, comming atchu with another review for this fantastic game...  SYKE!   Alright, now that you are here, you might as well just continue reading.  Alright class, we are here, now learning how to... yes you've guessed it; today, we will learn how to make a Classic Spaghetti Carbonara dish.   Ok, let's go ahead and get started! "
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"Hat Simulator 2 is a great game, that - ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Let's focus on TF2 here. TF2 is not your traditional FPS, it can be compared to Counter-Strike or CoD, but in reality, it is completely different. TF2 is more complex in a sense. Every single class has a complex element to it. There is no class that is considered the absolute best, because each has their own strengths and weaknesses. Good examples would include:   Scout is fast, but has low health and has to get in close to do real damage.   Soldier is strong, nice health, but is somewhat slow, however rocket jumping brings in a lot of mobility, at the cost of health.   Pyro can deal afterburn, is very balanced, is excellent support, but it really lacks any long range combat. At least a scout can go in, and go back, staying just out of another class' reach, but Pyro lacks this.  Demo has the highest DPS in the game, but he lacks hitscan weapons.   Heavy has massive health, but is incredibly slow, easy to snipe/stab as sniper or spy respectively.   Engineer has a good level 3 sentry to help him out, but he takes long to set up, and without his sentry, he is weak, with low health.   Medic has a decent health pool, can heal teammates that is massive help to any class, but he lacks firepower.  Sniper can pick off classes from a safe and a far range, but Sniper has a low health pool and cannot reliably fight off enemies from close range.   Spy is stealthy, sneaky, and can eliminate any class no matter high their health, as long as he get a backstab, take out sentries, but he has to play smart to do any good. (Has to cloak to get through mid, and backstabs require the enemy not checking.   ----------------------------------------------  After talking about the basics, let's talk about the 3 main things people do in TF2.   1. Playing TF2 on Valve Servers (known as pubs). 2. Trading in TF2. 3. Playing competitive.   ---------------------------------------------- We already talked about class compostion, now let's talk about pubbing. Pubbing is just playing TF2 how Valve wants you to do it - play on their offical servers, complete the objective. Ie: CP maps, capture the point, CTF, bring the flag from 1 side to the other, etc.   There really isn't much to talk about this, pubbing is simple, fun, and relaxing. New players will almost always start pubbing.  ---------------------------------------------- Trading in TF2 is relatively easy.  The key rule is buy for less, sell for more.   When you start off, you should start by selling weapons for a scrap each, and buying 2 weapons with that scrap.  It is a simple and easy concept, and eventually you will get enough to be able to buy cosmetics, and trade those.   To check the prices of everything, there are 3 majour websites to look for.   http://backpack.tf    http://trade.tf   http://steamcommunity.com/market   Backpack.tf is simple, just type in your item, and you can find it. You cannot find killstreaks, skins, and some misc. items.  Trade.tf has a spreadsheet where you can find the prices. Personally, I feel it is outdated, and not that accurate.   The latter, SCM, is harder to understand, basically you will need to convert the key value in the country, divide that by the item you have. Some items cannot be put up on the market. For example, in Canada, keys are 3.29. I have a tour of duty ticket worth 1.35. 1.35/3.29 = about 0.4-0.5 of a key.  Then, when you get to Unusual trading, you can buy unusuals. Unusual trading is complex, you can find info about it elsewhere. However, when you get to this point, the rest of the trading advice doesn't matter.  --------------------------- Competitive is something in TF2 that I have not gone over too much, therefore I can't talk too much about it. However,  http://playcomp.tf/  is a great to site to go to and learn about competitive. There are also videos on YouTube on it.   ---------------------------  TF2 is definitely a great game. It however, has some bugs and glitches, that Valve takes a while to fix.   Rating: 9/10.   Definitely a good game, you should try it. Free, and easy to play."
an awesome fps game
"If your looking for the game to ruin your social, economical and educational life, then now is your chance to play this ultimately serious and highly competitive game. It includes: - Original update ideas like the gunmettle update - Good looking skins - Good looking pixels which happened to be arranged in such a way that they looks like hats - Many interesting gamemodes  Be the one to play 3200 hours in two years.  No, wait, thats me."
"Holy Jesus, this game has stripped me of social life. I have spent HOURS playing this game and being more professional (owning hats and such) and has become in my opinion the must have game on steam, it's free and it acts like it is $60. This game doesn't have the stupid competitivity that CS:Go has that ruined the game for me. The community is also fun, with their sense of humor and all the fun internet trends that were inspired by this game (Pootis for example). All in all, GET THIS GAME its free, fun, and it isn't annoyingly competitive like CS:Go has become. 11/10 would sandvich again "
If you don't have this in your library then get off steam now
I love this Game!  I recommend it. 
the first server i played on had a spray of a pen15 in spawn.  was the best day of my life
i played for a bit.
"When you think about Fps, most first reaction is: SNIPER, MLG, TRICKSHOT, ect...  In this game you learn that some kind of the fps's stereotype are now DESTROY. Why ? Team fortress 2 is just a fps with a cartoon style mostly based on FUN, with differents classes and differents weapons, you can easily change your gameplay like your sexual orientation and continue to have this adrenaline of FUN ;) Different kind of games and events, Team fortress 2 seems like a porno web site with so much possibilities and categories !!!  BUT this game is not so EZ, you can have competitive players, tryharders, friendlies, Newbies, Killers, Drugs dealers, scammers, hackers, and more !!!    This game is really addictive Becareful ITS ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME ALRIGHT  (this text is really pervet if you look from another angle)"
"Team Fortress 2 changed my life, This is a game that triggered a spark of curiosity in me, more than 4 years ago. Until this day I more than love playing this game, due to the constant deviations of play style made possible by unique classes, exotic maps and a large variety of competitive gamemodes. This is a game that can be played in times both happy and sad, when it is sunny or when it rains. Even after over 2000 hours of gameplay, I get nothing but fun and happiness and so can you if you want :)"
i like the cosmetics 
10/10 sniper is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t class
This game is a great success to ALL fps shooters out there
"Not gonna lie, Team Fortress 2 might just be my favorite game ever. Normally, first-person shooters aren't my thing. I never was really into big bullet drop systems, realistic graphics, advanced bonuses and perks, all that stuff. Team Fortress 2 however, solves all of that. It's got everything I like about a game, in FPS form. Fun, quirky weapons that all have their bonuses and downsides. A ton of really cool maps and gamemodes. A fully fledged economy. 9 different classes all with completely different playstyles. And most of all, hats. (although i personally prefer shiny guns).   The overall gameplay is fast paced in most places, but can be given a much different manner based on the class you play. Even the weapon choices define the way you will play.   This game is 100% free, and there's no real pay-to-win aspect to it. Only pay-to-look-really-good. There's basically no reason NOT to buy this game. Get it. Now.  'Thanks, and have fun.'"
"I really enjoy this game! It's Fun, Funny, Epic and a bit Intense for people. Playing as all nine of the wonderful classes is something you can't even get your hands off of! Really Enjoy This Game! GET IT Now!"
There is something so great about this game that i cannot describe.  With competitive coming to this game soon i think you should give it a try.  I have over 1200 hours at the time of this review and I still love it!
Bought too many hats Still not good at this game 12/10
Okay so  team fortress 2 right  so its a game the most fyun game get it have fun W + M1 Get a gibus have fun get vote kiciked join another server have fun get a start hat trade that hat for ahat then get more hats so hats then get pro.

"I like hats and I like this game. If you like hats too, you should try it."
this game is AWESOME.. if you are not downloading it right now.. go ahead and do so its a cool game with multiplayer and trade servers to have fun and play with others :)
"I am poor I am homeless i live in a tent near a coffee shop, to get internet I have no life Nobody loves me But atleast I have a lot of hats and skins, and stranges GabeN is love, GabeN is life "
My first game on steam. This game has a very strong community. 11/10
"Everytime i feel down, i just open up TF2 and play it for a bit. it really makes me laugh, smile and forget why i was upset :) It's also just fun to play with friends, all the different gamemodes, weapons, hats ect. It's really fun if you're not a tryhard COD player (crying kid).  TF2 is love, TF2 is life ~ Yilk"
"Best F2P game I've ever played. Year-round events, drops, and so much more. Turn the tide of battle by equipping unique and wacky weapons, each with their pros and cons. Gr8 game, would bang."
"One day sitting at my computer playing minecraft i thought to myself, theres got to be more games then this! then gaben smashes through my window with a 3 in one hand and tf2 in the other one and a unusual gibus on his head, he handed tf2 to me and flew out the window into the clouds above... I looked down at the majestic tf2 logo it started to levitate and float toward my computer and in a flash of lightning it was installed... i was astonished at what lay before my eyes THE BEST FPS EVER and ever since that moment i have been sitting here playing tf2... trying... to get... every... hat..."
it's free to play and very replayable. doesnt take much space and i've had fun with this for years. rarely had any significant lag problems. i recommend it.
The ultimate money-and-life-waster. The community is massive and isn't toxic. And there's SO much more to this game than the shooting.
9/11
"This game, you should download it, now!!!"
"75% off, what a great deal. Don't miss out on this fabulous hat hunting game."
Will give you a boner so unconfortable you have to tell your mom to suck you off.
This game is amazing! I would definitely recommend it to anyone willing to try it. Just be patient because you are going to die a lot your first few games.
1000 Hours of my life wasted on Hats. Im proud of my self.
"I cannot think of ANY other first-person-shooter which you can:  1. Dance the Conga. 2. Wear a fairy tutu. 3. Hit someone with a fish until death. 4. Chuck milk (and a suspicious yellow liquid) at people. 5. Eat a sandwich. 6. Try and get aliens drunk.  You may be thinking you know shooters, but TF2 is compleatly different and the most creative shooter there is. And it's free. Get it. Now."
I LOVE THIS GAME!! i always play it since that is the only game i have
"It's really fun, and the most advanced F2P game on Steam. But. just don't be a F2P, as you can see people will critisize yiu."
"Team Fortress 2 is a extremely fun FREE 2 play game. I strongly recommend you play TF2 if your into first person shooters and fun strategic games. TF2 offers a massive variety of game modes to choose from, some of these great modes include capture the flag, payload (push a cart to a marked area) control points and the list goes on and on. Whilst TF2 has many game modes it also offers 9 classes with special play styles. The classes include, scout, soldier, pyro, demoman, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper, and spy. Personally, my favourite class would be the sneaky Frenchman spy. The reason behind this is because the spy offers such a different play style compared to the other classes. For example, the spy can disguise as ally and opponents, can cloak to become invisible, instant kill people with a knife from behind and can sap enemy engineer buildings. All classes include a fascinating story line and have hilarious personalities. I strongly believe that all first person shooter lovers should play Team Fortress 2"
"Team Fortress 2 is one of the best class-based shooters out there. The classes are all unique, but you need all of them to succeed. The variety of gamemodes and maps means you'll never get tired of this game, as well as the large amount of weapons included in TF2. TF2 is all around and an amazing game, and I recommend it to anyone and everyone."
Pays 18$ For A Pink Beret In Game. Pays 12$ To Make My Gun Shiny. Spends 2$ For My Gun To Count Kills. Wastes 3 Days Of Life To Get A Head On My Gun. Spends ( INFO REDACTED ) On Hats. Blows 7$ For A Reskin Of A Default Weapon. Spends Entire Time Listening To 7 Year Olds. Loses Hearing From Mic Spam. Plays On Trade Servers Due To Lack Of Variety. Breaks PC Equipment From Rage. Donates 10$-25$ To Servers For Godmode.  This Isnt 'Hat Simulator' This Is 'Cashgrab Fortress'  But I Still Put 700+ Hours Into This Unbalanced Deathmatch.  EDIT: They Added Weapon Skins...  This Isnt 'Cashgrab Fortress' This Is 'CashStrike: Global Fortresses'
this is my drug :3
its ok
Great game it was really fun the community was a little bleh and my last point is HATS!
"Would reccomend. 10/10 conga, hat, trading, fortress simulater 2015."
1293493238/2 - IGN ♥♥♥♥ game its not worth the amount of money you could spend on this seriously i spent all of my money on this and now im dead because i forgot to buy food
'I am prepared to give you five hundred dollars for that drink hat.' - Some random Sponge Bob episode  This is all you need to know about TF2.
It's TF2
"10/10 best hat sim, best russian simulator, and best conga simulator.   But in all seriousness, this game is amazing. The perfectly crafted mix between satire and seriousness, the humor that Valve put in, and all of the hats? Pretty amazing."
do you like dress up games? well this is the game for you.
(ง ͠° ͟ل͜ ͡°)ง ( ͡o ͜ʖ ͡o) 8/8 m80 180 ign would play again rated to many doritos ( ͡o ͜ʖ ͡o) (ง ͠° ͟ل͜ ͡°)ง
"its a game that u can get soo many items,hats, and much more.its a nonstop first person shooter!!! (or third person)"
"Day 1278, still getting rekted by w+m1 pyros in valve servers,  10/10 game is balanced"
"Well I think its time I made an Actual Review for this game.  Team Fortress 2 in my opinion is one of the most team based FPS shooters asides from Counter Strike and others. It has 9 classes with a wide range of strengths and weaknesses but together as a TEAM they can overcome their weaknesses and use their strengths to acheive a certain goal. Though you could destroy entire Valve servers by your self without the use of teamwork (AKA Pubstomping). But wheres the fun in that?  As of typing this review Offical Competitive Matchmaking is in a Beta and only currently has 6V6 Which is one of the competitive modes I will go in to further depth in the next paragraph. But normally competitive TF2 is ran by the community who give up their free time to let others play Comp TF2 (They the TRUE MVP'S)  The following are competitve formats:  1. 6V6 usually teams are 2 Soldiers 2 Scouts 1 Demo and 1 Medic but offclassing is done sometimes. This one is my favorite tied with 9V9  2. 9V9 is one of every class on one team which I think is great because ALL classes can bring something to the table which makes for great games.  3. 4V4 is 1 Soldier 1 scout 1 Demo 1 Medic I don't take much interest in 4v4 though it is a very fun and interesting mode because its like 6's but with 1 less scout and 1 less soldier  4. 2V2 Ultiduo is 1 Soldier and 1 Medic I have played this a few times as both medic and soldier and it is a very fair and fun gamemode I don't play it often but sometimes I grab my soldier friend and play it (or I play soldier cause they can't protect a medic for ♥♥♥♥)  5. 1V1 (MGE) 1v1 or MGE is not something that I have played a lot only twice as a matter of fact. Its any class I think and usually if you wanna be 'competitive' both of you will say for example play sniper to see which one is 'better' usually first to 20 wins.  Every format is played on different gamemodes to suit that format. Example Payload is a staple of the 9v9 format. King of the hill is played on both 9V9 and 6V6 (I think 4V4 and 2V2 Ultiduo too but not for sure) 5 CP Is a staple of 6V6 4V4. 1V1 is played on an empty map but with no objectives other then to defeat your opponent.  As of this review these are the following gamemodes:  1. CTF (Capture the Flag/Intelligence)  CTF has been apart of TF2 for a long time even the Grandfather of maps 2Fort is a CTF gamemode map. On offical Valve servers first to 3 flag captures wins the round. This gamemode is not really played competitively but does have the potential too but when it is its usually played by 6V6 or 4V4  2. King of the Hill (KOTH for short) KOTH is a great gamemode played by lots of competitive formats. At the beginning of the round the 1 and only control point (the hill) is locked but after a few seconds it will become neutral and available for capture by either RED or BLU. One team must hold the point for 3 minutes to win the round. This is played competitvely by 9V9,6V6 and I think 4V4 and 2V2  3. Control Points (5 CP) Ah 5 CP as I mentioned before it is a staple of 6v6 format and 4v4. At the start of the round both teams have 2 control points locked and owned to them leaving the middle point Neutral for both teams. Capturing the middle control point is important as it unlocks the next point for you to capture. If all control points are in your teams possesion then you win the round.  4. Payload Payload is a classic for 9v9. Just like 5 CP is a staple of 6v6. Payload is a staple of 9v9. At the start of the round RED team has about 1 minute to set up defences and prepare to stop the BLU team who are pushing the cart to the RED base. For RED to win they have to hold off BLU for however long they have to (5 minutes before they capture the first point if RED loses a checkpoint BLU gains time to push). For BLU to win they have to push the cart all the way to the RED base while capturing checkpoints along the way to gain more time to push. Payload is mostly played by 9V9 5. Payload Race and Arena Mode and Special Delivery The reason I put these 3 together is because Arena mode is basically dead so is Special Delivery and Payload race is not really a good gamemode for comp (so is Arena mode and Special Delivery) lets start with Arena Mode. Arena is any class and any amount of people fight to the death there is no respawning in arena until the next round starts. If both teams are still alive by a certain time a control point will open and whatever team captures it they win no matter how many people are alive thats one way to win another is just to kill the entire enemy team. Payload race is just both teams have 1 cart and they have to push it to each others base. First team to get the cart to the enemy base wins. Special Delivery is basically 1 flag CTF both teams have to take the flag to one point of the map whoever gets it first wins the round.  None of these gamemodes are played competitvely.    6. Attack and Defence (CP) Attack and Defence is like Payload but with Control points its usually played by 9V9. RED team has 1 minute to set up defences to stop BLU. BLU has to capture all the controls points to win but everytime they capture a point they gain time. For RED to win they have to defend for a certain amount of time ranging from 5 to 20 minutes. This one is weird because maps such as dustbowl are not played competitvely but maps like Steel are.  This game does have trading but the economy is kinda ♥♥♥♥ed at the moment (Check Backpack.tf) but hey Hats are cool amirite?  Overall Team Fortress 2 is a great game I love the game and it is my favorite of all time. I suggest if you don't play it to try it.  If you read this far may Gaben bless you."
"Great Game, King Of The Hill, Payload, Control Points, Even Multiplayer! Weapons, Fighting, Explosives, Sentry's! A Great Fighting Game!"
"Best FPS game ever played,never get bored. And you can even trade awesome stuff with each other! Lots of different fighting you can think of. This game is awesome!"
"Bread, Hats, Weapons, What more could you want? It has food, decoration and explosions, just like a party (with murder and death)"
"Okay, okay. I had back then a review recommending this game. Then a review not recommending this game. And now I'm back to recommending this game again.  But why?  Okay, here is the thing. TF2 is no longer as good as it used to be. Atleast to me. One part is also because of nostalgic feelings as I played this game for 4 wonderfull years with my friends, who all left tf2 and eventually left me.  But this game is still fun, especially when you have the right community. I love the TPF community. TPF means Team Play First and I learned about it from Mr. Paladin. So yeah, this game is fun. Loads of different classes and playstyles with them. Different items which enhance your palystyle in any direction. Different gamde modes and loads of costum maps and servers.  But you have to watch out. Some servers and communities are bad. Where people only insult. Or where you actually got a Pay to Win system. I call them 'premium servers' and you can get legal cheats such as more movement speed, larger clip size and/or faster firing speed with just donating money to the server, or typing !premium in the chat to test it out for like 15 minutes or so. I hate them to the bone, I never play on them. Just. No.  I also hate the trading system. I just don't leike it. Most people try to scam you. I also don't really see the point in all this trading stuff.  Anyways.  This game is fun and play it as long it is still alive. It is true, tf2 is dying slowly. Maybe it lives for one or two more years. Maybe for five. Depending how long Valve will keep this game updated with fresh content.  But until then, have some fun. It is free. It is worth it."
An EPIC game free 2 play and lots of fun kill your emany with all kinds of ways back stabs and headshots and other ways to you can play with your freands i say you sould go and play it if you dont got it you need to get it!! and see what you can do and a fun time :)

"Another valve 3rd party game, the game is good. The development team is bad. I remember playing this game in 2012/2013 with good fps and nice game updates."
10/10
"5 Star! One of the best games I've ever played!  The gameplay is fun and kenetic, the music and SFX are cool and funny at the same time, and TF2 is one of those rare awesome MMOs that continue to set the bar higher and higher for itself, well surpassing what it once was.   Especially loving the MVM mode!"
"Wasted hours of my life on this game.  You will, too."
"The best game where you run around and shoot people, make fun of gibus+pyrovision+merc noobz, accuse people of hacking, play on le volvo servers or play some messed up server suferring from admin abuse, spend your life earnings on shiny guns and hats and overall enjoy yourself. O_o"
Nice game.You should play this if you dont have it :3
I love this game with all the weapons and stuff keep up the good work valve! 
"Get this game right now, install it right now! Play it right now! Worth every second of your life! 10/10"
"People say that the Pyro and his weapons are unskilled, but I say this isn't true. If the Phlog wasn't skilled, I wouldn't score top player with it.   69/10 Salty W+M1 Players"
"Looks like Valve no longer really cares or listens too the community, it was fun while it lasted but I think I'm done with nothing but disappointment after disappointment. It's not the the game is 'Bad'. Though I admit the last update has defintiely made it a lot worse. It's just that the updates, development, optimization and promise breaking is what turns me off. Good bye my sweet it was fun while it lasted."
"If you enjoy ♥♥♥♥♥♥ updates, waiting way too long to join a 'casual match', gaining 0 xp if you waste 30 min of your life playing competitive and someone leaves the game, hackers, 12 year olds, atrocious community servers, greedy and deaf devs, thousands of wannabe exploiters, this is definitely your type of game"
"played this since 2007. community is terrible, game runs like crap, competitive is a joke, there have been unfixed bugs since beta and all valve cares about is milking this game for more money by catering to the traders. how about that bug where all weapons are visible at once? been almost 2 years and they failed to fix it.   tf2 was good in 2007-2010, now it's just being milked until the small 60k playerbase dies. the playerbase is full of kids who were in diapers when this game released, cheaters and their alt accounts are everywhere since the game is so old, bot accounts for trading and making servers look full also exist, and another chunk of the playerbase are just traders who love staring at their virtual items with particle effects they paid hundreds of dollars for. 17k people were vac banned when a certain cheat got detected, even i'f im generous and round that down to 10k, to account for alt accounts and people getting vac'd in other games(3k appears to be the average each day last i checked), that means 1/6th of this playerbase are cheaters. this game can't even push 1k viewers on twitch.   overwatch is better."
"Ok Valve you have somewhat redeemed TF2 (What an achievement)! By that I mean even after they pretty much ruined pub servers they somehow found a way to make it better again. One major way they fixed matchmaking is now it doesn't take like 10 minutes to get into a game. The least I wait now is maybe about a minute and that is a HUGE improvement. Also they allowed people to be capable of joining in the middle of a match (Bye-bye 5 v 12 team advantages!). I see why they added the matchmaking gimmick to begin with: the little snobby brats from Overwatch came over to TF2 and where nagging about how Overwatch is better in every way, and Valve stood there like 'Hmmm These people are talking about the hip new game so they must know what they are talking about!'. So if your gunna blame anyone, Blame the ♥♥♥♥ing Overwatch fgts for TF2 matchmaking. Now honestly since they fixed the matchmaking bugs I can't help but enjoy it. It is pretty damn good on pub servers without idiots constantly team stacking to the winning side, noobs joining spectator and joining their original team after getting dominated, ect. So maybe it isn't AS perfect as before but it can be considered better in alot of ways. Thank you from the bottom of my heart Valve for trying to keep this amazing classic-of-a-game alive and (nearly) well. &lt;3 P.S. SCOUT HAS A BETTER BUTT THAN TRACER CONFIRMED!"
"Alotz of content, i love the classes, and also the HATS "
I'll be honest... I used to love TF2. Then this update. WHY!? I don't know. Valve managed to destroy my whole love for the game by ruining the whole meaning of 'Casual'. Now even the standard servers are filled with tryhards and rage-quitters.  Think we could get a Casual-er mode?
"After the Heavy vs. Pyro update, this game became unplayable. I'm sorry to see this happen, as I loved playing this game. I never had problems with finding a server, but now Valve forces people to stop playing the game the way they played it for 9 years. Unless they go back to the way things were, I'm afraid they lost me as a player. I hear Overwatch is nice this time of year. :)"
"I heard a patch/update is in the works to fix the bugs and unfortunate decisions Valve made on the MYM update. For now, since the game is unplayable on my end, I'm gonna leave it a thumbs down. Come on Valve! Let's Make TF2 great again!    http://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=22797 "
"I've been playing this game since the date it was released. I can honestly say that even some latest games can't compare to the good old Team Fortress 2.  Why do I recommend this game? + A lot of different game modes (official game modes such as payload or you can also try unofficial: surf, deathrun, etc.) + A lot of fun, even after playing for long periods of time (I've made many smaller and bigger breaks from this game but I'm still coming back) + Trading &amp; Virtual items (I think I'm capable of talking about this for hours, I've traded from Unique Flaregun to a Golden Fryingpan and many more unusuals, sadly I got hijacked and lost ~5000€. Valve denied to give me items back, however I started trading again but in CS:GO rather.) + Funny and enjoyable game (I keep getting back to this game every once a while)  What I don't like about this game? - FPS Drop (I'm that guy who needs at least 300 fps to be able to play game at its finest. My computer is more than decent to run it, for ex. CS:GO at 512 fps, stable in competitive matches. However in TF2 I'm getting huge drops, sometimes from 400 fps to 60 fps. There isn't problem in my drivers or os updates. Many people have fps drops aswell and are forced to run the game at it's lowest settings (I had to use so called Chris CFG for achieving the wanted frames - 512 stable). - There isn't anything I would like to change, however I would be glad if Valve would listen to their community and what they want more."
"Im pretty sure everyone knows about this little gem, and anyone who owns steam has probably played it at one point or another so Ill just say this....   WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ WOULD YOU GIVE A GRENADE LAUNCHER, STCKY FRIGGIN GRENADE LAUNCHER TO A SCOTTISH BLACK MAN AND THEN SEND HIM OUT WITH AN UNLIMITED SUPPLY OF BOOZE (or whatevers in there)? Then again their medics a mad scientist who had his license revoked, the Soldiers so stupid i dont even know how he knows to work his rocket launcher, and pyros......just......see for yourself....    10/10 ruined my life in every way and I still cant put it down."
Hats. I like hats. This has hats. Hats are good. Hats...? hats. We can agree? Hats.
Team Fortress 2 is one of the best games I have ever played in my life. First time I started playing this game was when I was a kid and I play this game to this day. This game is awesome for good players and good mood on servers. Costume mods are one of the best thing on TF2 like Dogeball and Saxton Hale. You also can play normal mods like attack/defense. Attack/defense is one of the best in my opinion. TF2 is my all time favourite game and everyone can play this game because its Free to play. But who want to buy in-game items you can buy them in Mann co. or community market and become Pay to play.
"TF2 is probably the best game on steam, hands down. With a vast community, ever expanding set of weapons, styles, and playstyles, its hard to get bored of it! 10/10"
&gt;Downloads TF2  &gt;Opens  &gt;Joins server  &gt;Picks Soldier  &gt;Shoots a random crit at a lone Pyro  &gt;Gets it reflected back   &gt;Cries
First time playing: *FreeToPlay*  'Pretty cool game. Though why would you pay for virtual cosmetics? How silly.'  Now: *PayToPlay*  'Darn.'
"Team Fortress 2 is a game that surprises you, even after hundreds of hours of gameplay. It is prized for its comedic value and no-try-hard gameplay, as well as giving you one of the most exhilierating experiences you will ever have. No matter what skill level you are at, you are guaranteed a great time.  But, just remember, TF2 is not an FPS. It is a hat simulator."
Why should you play this game:   1 - FUN  2 - FREE   That's it. It's fun and free what more do you need. Now stop reading comments and play the game.  GL HF :)
Start playing at 6:00  Play for five minutes  Look at clock  Is 8:00  Get confused  Play for 2 hours  Go outside  Human race extinct   10/10 would time travel again
its ok
"TF2 is a well formed FPS for every age. The multiple ways to combine weapons to make the ultimate DMG combo is fantastic desinged. Sadly there are too many Gibus F2P CoD kids who are sometimes ruining the game, but sometimes the best ways to laugh A LOT. Sadly some of my favorite weapons got a nerf but at the moment the phlog got a buff, which makes you with a little bit of skill nearly god like. A in all it's a good skill based game"
"THIS GAME IS FUN,COOL, AND PERFECT!!!"
"It's ok, Gets boring really quick though."
Nice game for new steam suer
"10/10, Easily the best game I've ever played. I've gotten more hours out of this FREE game then I would have a $60 one!"
Awesome Game ! Worth premium :) loving it :D thank you valve for making this game :D
Damn good and damn free game for teamplay ^^   We have lotsa fun there .   Come and join us .  
Fun To Play And Trade With Other People! Also A Very Competitive Game
"Can't stop playing , I invested 90% of the money on this game  11/10"
It's alright.
"First of all, I want to start out by saying that I am not the most experienced player, but TF2 isn't a game where experience really matters. I have around 1500 hours, but I am a decent trader and have come pretty far into trading. What I mainly want to review is the stuff I know about: Competitive and Trading. Perhaps the most well-known aspects of the game, yet the most fluctuated (in terms of rating or liking).   Trading  Trading- unless you are extremely experienced- revolves around two things: Luck, and Patience. Although you do need some other skills (Price checking, negotiation etc.), you hardly ever get good deals unless you are trading with some 10 year-old whose mother spent well-earned money on a virtual game. Sometimes I do get good deals (good in TF2 trading terms means profit) on some decently experienced players, but it is rare.( For Me!)   Competitive  From the TF2 servers I've played on competitive can be good, bad, or of course just normal. Why? Because in one game you might be absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the asses off the other team, but then 'You have been switched to the other team due to auto-balance'. Another example: One team might have a player wearing a Burning TC, yet the others are fresh out of installation, roaming cluelessly around with their gibuses on. Well, that's my review, this was just all my opinion, and I respect every one elses Bye!"
You can fly around and whack people in the face with a folding shovel. What's not to like?
"Best Hat Simulator Ever!    Just Kidding, still a hat simulator. An amazing game made by GEBAN and its all about team work. Great game. Rate 10/10!    GABEN  By the way,  I like deh booty ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
It's ok I guess....
It's good I guess
This game is awesome! No matter are you f2p or p2p!
"Al my friends have made a review so me too!!! Sorry for bad england! sometimes there are russians but only sometimes! I play it to collect hats, but you can play it as a fighting game too!"
I had fun with it.
Love this game so much. It just my fav game of all time
"Yeah, I can't say that this game is bad. It's fun. It's addicting. But, sadly, it's getting worser and worser. Even the new competitive thingy... Is not competitive enough. You'll probably get bored of it after ~800 hrs of playing. But I recommend it, if you're new to it.  Don't forget to buy hats "
Bad awesome game. 's not like I wasted 1600 hours of my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ useless life in it. As well as money.  I regret nothing.
"'Team' is in the name, and if you aren't a team player, you will hate this game. There are many people you'll meet who won't fight, but instead will throw sandviches at you!"
"Never played the game much before the crap update, but I most certainly will not be playing now. Sat for 20 minutes trying to queue for a got dam casual match, and it didn't find one for me. Will not be playing this game until it is fixed."
"When I heard competitive TF2 was a thing, I was psyched, ready to go back to the game to enjoy some pubbing, and instead I find myself in a game I'm no longer familiar with, it feels like TF2 is trying to follow the Overwatch formula, while it's not bad in it's own, trying to get into unranked matchmaking takes forever, and the teams aren't really balanced, random crits are STILL a thing, and you get penalty for leaving a CASUAL game, the new update really killed the fun of what makes a CASUAL game like TF2 fun.  I mean, launch the game, hop into a server, enjoy and pub for about a bit, and that was it, yet it was pretty fun regardless.  With the new update, I can't be arsed to wait 10+ minutes just to join a casual game (which replaced pubs) only to find myself feeling frustrated as I can't play the maps I specifically want, the gamemodes I specifically enjoy nor enjoy a full game of payload, not having the game getting cut off just because the other team made it significantly further than ours in the previous round  At first glance, Overwatch felt like it's copying TF2, but it turns out the game plays so much differently with the use of abilities and ultimates, but right now, it feels like TF2 is copying Overwatch's competitive formula.  I don't really enjoy the formula in Overwatch, nor do I enjoy it in TF2  I'm hoping Valve brings back pubs, or at least bring improve the whole casual/ranked formula by making waiting times shorter, improving the gamemodes, allowing custom HUDS, etc, but for now I think I'm going to wait and see if things get better, if not worst  On an unrelated note, TF2 right now seems to be running absolutely terrible compared to the previous updates"
This update made the game pure ♥♥♥♥. I almost clocked in 2k hours but now I'm heading to other csgo/overwatch and not looking back. Unless valve gets their ♥♥♥♥ together and deliver on what they promised then I'm done.
"Please, please just let us casuals have our place and play in peace. I just want to pick my map on a Valve server with no crappy plugins or ads or jerks on alltalk and have a good time. The latest update went a long way toward fixing what was broken but WE NEED VALVE SERVERS!! Also voting"
"I kind of joined the tf2 scene late. I didn't really get to experience community servers as they used to be. But my experiences in tf2 all come from pubs. I met some of my best friends on pub matches just having fun. It feels like something that has been a nearly daily occurance to me isn't there anymore, and that makes me really sad honestly. I loved this game and I sincerely hope that Valve brings back pub servers. I'm not a competetive player by any means and honestly if i want that I will go play a game that feels like it should be based on that. Not a wacky 50's style hyper violent black humor game."
"I cant even get to the match. The searching screen is endless. This WAS one of my favorite games, and now is ruined. I really enjoyed the classical casual game and now is gone. I guess I'll go for overwatch and no this bad competitive mode imitation. Thank you very much valve."
"Tempted to cash in my items after this train wreck update.  Thanks a bunch, volvo."
-Fun game -Many ways to play it -Good concept -Funny bugs and exploits :D -And MORE!!  I recommend this game!
Go back to cod this game is not for filthy casuals like you.
"Skin Update: 'Aw ♥♥♥♥'  Tough Break Uptade: 'Awwwww fuuuuuuuck'  Competative U[date: 'THEY ♥♥♥♥ED IT UP TOTALLY' Valve used to be good, come on, what the ♥♥♥♥ is this ♥♥♥♥."
Uncel Daen iz verly goud sentry men
Pretty dank and old game spend all ur money on ur moms credit card and youll be set
Team Fortress 2 makes people laugh and that the reason i play this game
a Great Game If you're a richass
Played it for a few minutes.  its a pretty ♥♥♥♥ game tbh
best game and always been fun to play
Team Fortress 2 will always be in my heart &lt;3
I played it for a little bit. Pretty good.
"Very, very bad game."
" TL;DR ---&gt; Sadly, Team Fortress 2 is killing itself. (Sorry for possible bad english)."
"PROS: - Hats. - Free to play. - Strong community. - Graphics and caricatures. - Bunch of user-generated contents. - Lifetime support and updates confirmed (it is Valve.)  CONS: - Hats (sick of them.) - Lack of tribute to id and Quake. - More players means inevitably more kids and toxic players, too (statistically speaking.)  'RECOMMENDED'"
"Okay, let's take a look 'ere. We all love TF2, before this update made it like ♥♥♥♥. We've been doing QuickPlays, having fun, doing ♥♥♥♥ stuffs and all. All of sudden, Valve adds this ♥♥♥♥ update now, and they changed our amazing QuickPlay to that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Casual 'search a ♥♥♥♥ game and lose'. I still love TF2, but it already has went to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because of this.  11/10 - You made TF2 horrible, Valve 'Till then, it's not Recommended, but there are other good gamemodes."
It's funny when you forget that the Pyro's flamethrower doesn't work underwater and you get murdered as a result.
"Before the MYM update TF2 used to be a mess. A somewhat enjoyable mess, but still a mess.  Now after the Meet Your Match update I doubt if the game is going to be enjoyable again.  If you want to play this game, think twice and maybe choose something else."
"With its powerful artistic style and blazingly quick, yet accessible gameplay, it's enough to melt the icy cynicism imprisoning the hearts of even the most jaded among us. That being said, it's not the most complex shooter out there. Buy it, load it up and let loose. It's near-impossible to be disappointed. Also another shooter Overwatch is an even more incredible achievement in multiplayer shooter design. It bobs and weaves almost perfectly between being the quick-fix adrenaline hit you might want after a long day of work, and the thoughtful, strategic multiplayer experience that becomes the center of evening-long binges with friends. It might not have the most exhaustive list of maps and modes, but it provides nearly endless opportunities for exhilarating, coordinated play, and when you’re the one at the center of it, it feels like nothing else. Anyone that has played Team Fortress 2 should check out Overwatch, Team Fortress 2 is a great game, but honestly its 10 years old now, updates cant change that."
There is so much to be said about this once loved game. In a nuttshell. LITERALLY and i mean LITERALLY everything has been ♥♥♥♥ED. to put it in teh simplsit terms. Valve promissed changes. They made everything worse in the MYM update.... Thanks Obama.
Best cartoon game ever played
"Team Fortress 2, the best hat simulator 2013-14-15 whatever.  This game got me addicted and still haven't stopped playing ever since I stopped playing Garry's Mod.  This game has many things to do like Control Points, Capture the Flag, and many more.  The number one thing about this game is hats. Yes, Hats. Valve released an update I think about 2011 maybe? Which added crates and keys. This update made it possible to get the 'Unusual hat' An Unusual hat is a rare hat you get from a crate. It's a 1% chance to get one. For myself, I got one on my other account on Nov. 22, 2013 I think.  On the otherside this game is fun to play as all the classes. If you plan to stick with one class it's alright.  Okay, ignore what I said above this game ruined my life. 11/10 Hats &lt;3"
"One of the coolest games ever! The Multiplayer is amazing and the way they conerted the Source Engine into this it's just awesome. It's free and that's very good, and even it will be on money I will buy this game."
Fun games you should get it
"I love the unusuals and hats of this game, I recommend it"
"If you're looking for a silly shooter game, then this is the game for you! TF2 has lots to offer like hats, taunts, communities, and much more. TF2 is also FREE! Go ahead and get yourself this game and get into the TF2 world."
"If someone would tell me this is Dressing Game, i would belive him... 10/shrek"
"The short answer is, it's holding up very well. The core action pits two teams of players against each other in a battle to capture points, move a cart, or steal a briefcase. The objective is always very straightforward; it's the interplay between the nine playable classes that makes things so varied and interesting. The speedy scout, the militant heavy, the diligent engineer, the conniving medic, the pesky sniper, the sneaky spy, the feisty pyro, the explosive soldier, and the even-more-explosive demoman all have unique weapons, attributes, and abilities that complement each other and clash in myriad ways. Encounters can vary widely depending on the match type and the makeup of each team, and this unpredictability is crucial to TF2's long-standing appeal.  When you come out of the gate as a heavy with a medic in tow, you're a formidable offensive force, but if a spy loops around to backstab the medic and you round the corner on a pyro, it can all come undone in a matter of seconds. Snipers can cover expected enemy paths, but rocket-jumping soldiers have a knack for finding alternative routes and raining explosive death from above. You may think you have a comparatively weak scout dead to rights, only to be stunned by a baseball and beaten to death. As you watch your giblets splatter on the ground and see a freeze-frame of your gleeful killer, it's hard not to chuckle at the sheer variety of ways you can meet an untimely demise. And the humorous quips, ridiculous outfits, and histrionic announcer help cultivate this lighthearted tone.  Of course, this core dynamic has persisted for most of TF2's life span, so if you stopped playing it a few years ago and come back for a few matches, you'll find things are very familiar. Learning the ropes and getting the hang of your chosen role is still a gratifying experience, and mastering advanced techniques doesn't just make you deadlier; it gives you more options for how to approach combat. Keeping your options open is still valuable too, because being flexible with your choice of character can help you avoid ending up on a catastrophically imbalanced squad. It is Team Fortress, after all.  But though there is much that has remained constant about the core game, there have been some notable changes over the years, as well as regular infusions of new weapons and items. Of the hundreds of things available in the online store, some can be unlocked through play, while others must be purchased with actual money. From small doodads that cost less than a dollar to massive bundles that cost hundreds, there's a wide range of ways to customize your experience.  Many of the items offer nothing more than a playful twist on the game's already cheeky cartoon aesthetic. You can buy hats, shirts, shoes, and other cosmetic gear to dress up like a character from Adult Swim or don spooky seasonal garb that you can wear only during Halloween or a full moon. Even if you don't fancy shelling out for any of this stuff, it's fun to see some visual variety as you try to light your opponents on fire.  Other weapons have more of an impact, like the ones that give your character a new chargeable and expendable power. The scout can build hype, which turns his usual double jump into a triple, quadruple, or quintuple jump, and the soldier can build rage, which allows him to rally his nearby teammates to do extra damage. Skills like these have more of a meaningful impact on the action, bringing something new to the table that your enemies must contend with. And then there are the totally out-there loadouts, like the one that turns the grenade-launching demoman into an extra from the movie Braveheart.In addition to the cosmetic options, there are a lot of weapons and items that offer small buffs or subtle tweaks to your attributes. Depending on which healing gun the medic equips, for example, he can imbue himself and his targeted ally with extra damage resistance or enable himself to match the speed of his target. Differences like these don't do much to change the core action, but they do give experienced players substantial room for strategic variation.  These options broaden the field of viable strategies, which helps keep combat lively and varied. And fortunately, none of the purchasable weapons or items tip the scales unfairly towards those willing to pay. Buffs and bonuses usually come with caveats, and the weapons that bestow new abilities are usually unlocked for free. For this review, I spent some money on goofy hats and some of the stranger weaponry on offer, like the pyro's flamethrower that actually shoots bubbles and rainbows. It was fun to play with the new gear, but I still found myself switching my loadout between free and paid weapons regularly to adapt to the match situation.  Pure game-play. 10/10."
"One of the best games to ever come out for PC. Its so addicting and fun to play with friends especially if you get into competitive scene. This game is worth the download and worth playing money to be able to trade because the amount of items, unusuals, weapons and hats you can get is insane. Would recommend to anyone 10/10!!!"
I rate this game 5/7
"This game will forever be in my heart, I love it to death and thats why I have invested over 1000 hours in it..."
This game is fun and Im already addicted!
"more than 10,000 hrs. I think it should be a good game to play that much :)"
"Random critical hits are a fair, and balanced mechanic that improves my overall well being, and Team Fortress 2 experience. As a matter of fact, please promote the man(or woman) who thought of adding this mechanic. But, If you cannot promote this god-like being, you failed. Besides random critical hits, Team Fortress 2 is a great game. Many other great mechanics reside in this video game besides random critical hits, these include the amazingly balanced reserve shooter, and it being a secondary weapon for the class pyro. This class can launch enemy players into the air with minimal effort, causeing them to take miniature critical hits on almost every shot. I am also elated by the fact that whenever I play as the class Machanic I am often brutaly murdered by detectives and they place zaps on my turretgun and care-giving machine, aswell as my man transporters. Please put a limated timer on the zap like in the game-mode Human versus Robot, more commanly known as Mann versus Machine, but have the timer be about 5 seconds. This concludes my reveiw of the Valve game known as Team Fortress 2. Remember, please, disregard any undeserved complements or insults in this review. Thank you."
Are you really looking up reviews for this game? You already ♥♥♥♥ing play it.
Cool
Awesome FPS game with (most) of the weapons being very well balanced! Nerf the phlog pls It runs smoothly on my PC and probably will on your's too unless you overload it with mods. The community is smaller than it's rival csgo which alot of people are quitting TF2 for. It's very well made for good fun in pubs. For more advanced players there is a compeditive scene *cough*tryhards*cough* Very easy to configurate I highly recommend to go and check it out In all of it's beauty TF2 is one of the most perfect games for those who like fun
"Such a fun and accilerating game, so many random fun and goofy crap happens while playing TF2 I have done so many hours on this game and none of them are wasted. If you wanna play a fun awesome and goofy game I recommend you play TF2."
Great game
its alright
have more hours on sniper then 50% of my friends list' hours on tf2.  it died for me
"Best Hat Simulator I have ever played. After 1000 hours and $500 dollars, this game turn me into a MLG Pro Hat god! Oh, it also has some mini games. 10/10 would craft hats again."
'Fast paced shooter with a lot of teamwork' They said Guess what They were WRONG
Better than Overwatch/10
  lol ive wasted an unbelievable amount of time on hat simulator cartoon edition and i won't get that time back thank you valve love you
My Gosh why havent u played this game!?!?!?! DOWNLOAD THE GAME! u will not regret this game.     
Amazing game! Definitely recommend
tf2=hats and war
"This game gives me satisfaction since 2006 when i was a kid and i always want to play that one day i watch all tf2 videos all day long until i got the game for free it makes me happy even though am just a f2p i have a better gaming in it if you found this game in your queue and you liked it watch some tf2 vids first watch muselk,NISLT,Blu and all youtubers who play tf2 and play this game at least you learned something in this game not like you play the game quickly and dint play the tutorial but its already dying but im still love this game"
Would put another 1k Hours into the game :P (and I probably will) 10/10 - Ign
Cool.
"With the new 'Meet Your Match' patch, Valve has effectively killed off what made TF2 fun: they made TF2 too serious. Every weapon/class balance was done to appease the competitive players and not for those of us who, SHOCKER, play TF2 to have fun, not to get salty about 'wrong class loadouts' or search times or ♥♥♥♥ like that. The Righteous Bison's ability to hit the same player multiple times was NOT A BUG, VALVE. This patch ruined TF2 for me, and I bet quite a few of the others who play it too. GG, Valve, you made TF2 like all those other competitive shooters out there and killed your casual fanbase. G-F-G."
End Of The Line wasn't that bad
Wow nice videos
I love this game so much! Even though the game has got alot of hate at the moment i still love it so much
Amazing game! I have never lost interest in this game. One of the best class based FPS games with its own unique play style. Everyone calling this game dumb needs to play this game with good players but since this game became F2P it has been filling with noobish players so maybe thats why this game has lost players... Definitely waiting for the new matchmaking system that has been rumoured.
"I've been playing TF2 since 2011. I really loved this game because I don't know what this has become now. I've always liked how Valve was such a unique company, making their games by not caring about the competition in the gaming industry. Right now, Valve seemed to try to get attention to new players and their money by having similarities to other games so they won't loose players. Biggest examples are the games Overwatch and CS:GO. The similarity with CS:GO with the skins for the weapons (which is unecessary and not original for the game) didn't have much impact in the game and it isn't a big deal for us since they are two games by the same company. The issue is Valve's obsession now to compete with Overwatch, which I don't understand why. I'll break it down to what is happening right now.  TF2 has a big community, which is well received by Valve when it comes to help and do what the community asks for. This includes the workshop items, maps, updates for fixes, etc... Since Overwatch's release, Valve has been scared to loose players for that game, which is understandble because the two games are close to being the same. But from a community point of view, it's not going to be a 'backstab' for Valve, we still play and love TF2 regardless. (I don't play Overwatch btw). The TF2 community was strong in the competitive mode and we were asking it for Valve to make it official for a time now. With yesterday's 'Meet your Match' update, the community was now pleased to try it out and Valve had finally it's chance to compete Overwatch with this (which is not why the community wanted Competitive mode for). With the update live right now, I'll say that TF2 went from being a good game to a bad game that quick. Here are my issues with the update:  - Casual Mode. Competitive mode is all we need, why is casual mode live just for the Heavy vs Pyro thing? If you want to change either Heavy or Pyro, just make a normal voting. Casual mode servers are bad and it makes no sense having ranks in it. A person cannot get in to a server and just play the game anymore. Now you have to wait 3 minutes minimum just to get players from your country to play 2-3 rounds with you and the game is over, you get to the menu and the cycle continues. Since they are less players now due to this the matchmaking takes forever now just to play for a short time. I literally got in to a server after 5 minutes of waiting, I got in close to ending the first round and just played the second round for 3 minutes and lost the match. This isn't fun.  - Competitive Mode. There is nothing wrong with competitive mode except for the matches starting regardless of how many players are in the server. If the server is 6v1 the game will start no matter what and I did experience such thing and lost the match of course.  -Viewmodel_fov gone and Item servers rarely working  Other than this the game is the same but those factors above change the game completely. I just wish this update reverses into something different than this or either to how the game was before. For now, this game is not worth it. For all the players, let us cry now and Valve please change this.  Rest in Peace TF2."
We have removed Team Fortress 2 because it is too confusing for new players.
Great game! 8/10
"though i like the game the new update is ♥♥♥♥ing trash valve, gaben do somethign ♥♥♥♥ign right for once and make teams fair like holy ♥♥♥♥"
its ♥♥♥♥ed
I liked it before. i did not compete in this game. i enjoyed the multiplayer. Coz it was fun. But now it is not.
"The video game equivalent of that Toyota Pickup they tried to kill on Top Gear. No matter how much stupid stuff they do to it, it still lives."
HATS HATS HATS . 10/10. It is a fantastic game that will never get boring and will stand the test of time
Dropping ubers like they are hot
"This is simple but fun game,with many hats..."
I still come back to this game after all this time. It's just a classic time-waster with friends.
I really wish I was finding degreasers right now
"So... It's about time I do a propper review about this game.... Endless fun, complexity you name it and it's pretty much garenteed to have it. This game will steal your life, it will BECOME your life. Would recommend to anyone.    Yay hats."
Have played worse.
"One of my favourite games of all time, worth every hour spent"
Knife + Back = Death
RIP my Wallet Still. Addicting af.
"Its free, its fun, its good, its highly recommended. i dont think i have to say more."
Though recent updates have definetly changed the entire game around the core is still there. It's STILL a silly class based FPS with many playstyles.  And yes there are still hats.
"It's a must-have game, unique in many ways, and extremely enjoyful! Also features trading, which is way bigger than you might expect. Be sure to give TF2 a try!  EDIT: I proudly nominated Team Fortress 2 for The 'Test of Time' Award!"
you wear hats while shooting guns. sometimes you wear things that aren't hats.
"After 9 years of development, Valve made another very good game that made me lose nearly 2000 hours of my life. Team Fortress 2 came out in year 2007 and is still getting updates which clearly shows how popular and awesome this game is. Game is really free to play which means that you don't have to pay any cent to wreck player who spent thousands of $ on it but you can buy premium to get 300 backpack slots instead of 50, free hat, ability to trade your items and ability to get rare items from weekly items drop but you will have to add at least 5€ to your Steam Wallet and just buy cheapest thing in Mann Co. Store (if you have already money in Steam Wallet, you don't even have to spend 0,10€ to buy one). I can easily recommend this game to everyone who wants to have fun without spending much money (or doesn't want to spend at all) and loves games with some team work, many mods (custom too) or just loves hats."
After 2000 hours I finally started getting a bit better.
This new update sucks.
"I play medic, that makes me better than you."
"Basically CS:GO, but with less Russians and more hats."
Best game for online fun or competitive play. In this game you can JUMP ON A PHACKING ROKET!
"Honestly one of the best games I've played, I haven't been able to stop playing since 2011.  help me"
I remember when this didn't have hats or new weapons.
"~800 hours on an old account and 750+ on this one, and it never gets boring  best free game ever."
many team such fortress much hats pls fix comp tho
Just download it allready... rly tho
"Once you play this game, youll never lose your Virginity, and youll become a hat addict. "
"Awesome game! Fast paced, intense, and fun for anyone!"
"It's something that came in my life and never left.  Been playing it for alot of time,I can assure you this game is still fun.  If you are looking for a free fps game without microtransactions,non-permanent weapons,unfair buffing and many other P2P crap features,then my good sir pick this one.With tons of gamemodes,guns,cosmetics that you choose if you wanna buy or not and many other things,this game proved to be the best free fps game that ever come out.  They may be alot of other free fps or rip-offs of this game,but they don't stand a chance against Team Fortress 2.  9/10,would totally recommend.  Edit: Still Awesome."
"This is a unique and fast paced game. There is also an element of strategy involved. Each class has it's own special way that you should play it, as does each gamemode. That makes for 81 different ways to play and that's not even including all the weapons that can change everything, such as the shields for the Demoman and the Bows for sniper. In short, this game is going to keep you interested with new things forever."
This is best game of war with red and blue team.
10/10 would play again
"It's not the same game i fell in love with years ago, but it's still great and worth checking out."
Fortress of balance 2.
"And Overwatch is supposed to 'kill' this game, which is arguably the best skill-based shooter on the market? AHAHAHAHAHA no.  There's a reason this game is still played 9 years after it first released. It's just that good.  Valve may not be that good with their support and updates as Blizzard is with Overwatch, but you don't see me playing Overwatch.  Why is that? Easy. TF2 is just the overall better product.   There's just so much more to do in this game.  More skill-based gameplay.  Extremely high skill ceiling for pretty much everything you do - Easy to learn, very hard to master.  An absurd amount of maps.  A counter-system that is by far easier to understand than Overwatch's counter-system, but while you will always struggle to counter a Tracer as, let's say, Mei, you can always kill a Scout as a Pyro if your skill level is high enough, which allows strategies Overwatch can only dream of.  Community servers with custom gamemodes like Saxton Hale or, my personal favorite, Tower Defense.  You get invested in the lore of the game much easier than Overwatch's lore just due to the humour this game has, since it doesn't take itself that seriously.  The characters have a lot more to them than Overwatch's characters.  The unlockable weapons allow to spice up the gameplay a lot, making the characters' gameplay vary greatly. The competitive scene of TF2 grows rapidly and is very exciting to watch.  Do I need to list more? I could go on for hours why I think that TF2 doesn't have 'real' competition, but merely a developer that needs to step up their game to make this game truly immortal, since it has the potential to be so.  If Valve would step up their game and either give TF2 the CS:GO treatment or focus a lot more on the game itself and talk to the community more, I honestly think that Overwatch will never be able to even come close to the giant that is Team Fortress 2.  tl;dr: It's the world's best war-themed hat simulator. If you like good gameplay coupled with a great community, you will have a lot of fun with this game. Like, a lot. Like over 2-4 thousand hours of fun. I'm dead serious, check my hours played."
"The core gameplay is incredibly good, and the game is worth playing for that alone.  However, a series of poor and lazy decisions by the dev team have brought Team Fortress 2 to a peculiar place. Bugs go unfixed, optimization leaves much to be desired, and balance issues plague pub gameplay. The decision to focus on larger games and Virtual Reality has hurt this game greatly.  Nonetheless, Team Fortress 2 is a game worth playing. That being said, I will not be putting more money into the game until some of these issues are addressed."
"I really appreciate this game for many reasons, but the primary one is that it recognizes its own absurdity. Not only that, but it embraces it and builds upon it."
"this game was very fun and also can buy and trade the item what ever you like, it also can put the any mod on tf2 too"
dis gaem is very g00d i trikstabed a skrub with my stock nife and i unboxed a strange purple ♥♥♥♥♥ i already hav 69 kils wit it i r8 8/8 m8 gr8 gaem
It's TF2. Simple as that.
Played this since 2011 and I still never get bored of it!
"Team Fortress 2 is a fast paced action packed FPS that really either gets me pumped up or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. The 7 different game styles makes it different than to, say, Call Of Duty in a sense that you don't just have to kill people to win. The stylised art makes its graphics differ from practically all other FPS games. The community is hilarious and interesting not to mention HUGE. The customisation of the character can give people their own costumes to be recognised as. The wide range of weapons with differing stats and effects give people different ways to play and differenmt ways to blow people into little bits. There are also differing game modes E.G Deathrun, Versus Saxton Hale, Deathrun ETC. Accompanied by a funky soundtrack to fit the game perfectly, TF2 makes a must get. 11/10"
recommended
"best game evah!!!! free,fun and is the right choice for gamers"
Still the best f2p game .
one of the best games valve has ever released.
"This game is the best simulator. I mean look at this. We have  Conga Simulator Russian Dance Simulator Hat Simulator Musical Simulator (Still waiting for spy,pyro,scout,heavy and engie to have some instruments Gabe!) Hat Simulator! Racing Bumper Simulator DUCKS Simulator Dis Crates Simulator Dance Simulator     Is even still the only game yet still that haves pepoles using lenny binds   8/10 - Ign. Not enough memes and simulators"
"Best FPS out there, there's nothing that compares to this masterpiece.            free steam award nomination badge"
cool
"Logged onto one of my favorite servers and started market gardening (blasting yourself up into the air and hitting someone on the head with a shovel before you touch the ground). I started dominating a couple people with that strategy and one person got fed up with it. He didn't land air shots very well so he went up to a high platform and waited for me to jump up and try to kill him. While he was waiting he placed sticky traps right underneath his feet (which can manually be detonated). His plan was to blow us both up when I came by. This was it, the perfect plan. How could it fail?   I saw the top of his head and took out my rocket launcher. I blasted myself right towards him with my shovel out. This was his chance, he was going to get his revenge! As I was soaring towards his direction I noticed little red sticky traps right underneath his feet. I quickly turned my mouse away from him and landed safely right beside him. Not noticing I changed direction he detonated his sticky traps and blew himself straight up into the air. Seriously one of the funniest moments I've ever had!   There are so many mechanics to this game. Each class has a counter class and each class has dozens of weapons you can get. Oh, and hats. This wouldn't be a good review if I didn't mention that. Seriously give this game a try. I didn't go into it thinking I'd like it but now it's my most played game on Steam. After being released back in 2007 it still holds it's own against new games, continually holding the third most played game on Steam."
thanks vavle for making the game good for us all tf2 player thank you Mr. Gaben
Really great game. I would recomend it to anyone out there.
"For the people who shun those who defend this game and label them as butthurt fans, whatever. I'm doing this for the steam award task."
"A game with terrible developers, but with a good community."
"This is probably my favorite game of all time. You will never get bored you always have something to do. Maybe first when you start the game it is not super fun, but when you play more and learn things like rocket jumping it gets very fun."
"It is a good game, during the many years of the game updating with thing that I hope was new, still amazes me today. Yey."
Is this game dead yet
Just win the award!!
play this now for 8 years i think! love it
"Team Foetress also know as TF2,Is a fun,cool,and sometimes funny. I love this game and you can to because its a free 2 paly game so come on what are you waiting for join the fun"
This game has probably taken more of my free time than every other game combined.  TF2/10
This is a good game
"Dominate F2Ps, eat sandvich, and sell hats."
this is the best game ever
This game is addictive! You will end up spending more money on it than any other game even though it's free.
"Best game I've ever seen, with so many mods and game modes you never get tired of it. Well balanced classes that all have flaws so no one can be 'OP'. Team work is what makes the game, hence the name 'team' fortress 2, you have to learn that you can't just go kill a whole team by yourself, it ain't gonna work that way. Comapred to the other fps this one has to be the best."
See Medic healing heavy with intell seem like best buddies 11/10 still a better love story than Twilight
Best Hat Simulator I ever played. GOTY
is cool and aseamone peles join 
"Well, this game is ♥♥♥♥. ABSOLUTE ♥♥♥♥! NOT EENOUGH TEAMS WE NEED MORE TEAMS LIKE PURPLE, ORANGE, GREEN, AND YELLOW........ Also the classes and maps are 'DUMB'-nate. Wish they could make these changes and i wish they wouldnt make it cartoonie. Its dumb like reid"
"A rather simple, yet entertaining first person shooter. Normal Objectives. Blow things up. Kill other players. Repeat. Just what i like :D"
This is the best game in my life :D
best game i ever had in my steam account!
By the love of the game player.
Buy this game because it is awesome.
"This is an awesome game! I love it I got addicted to it pretty fast. I didn't like '1st Person Shooters' games, but something about this game got me into it. Thank you Valve for making this amazing game!"
"Still rocks, even after all these years!"
10/10 great game will continue to play
"It's real interesting to play this game due to it's randomness and how unique it is. Though it may have it's backdraws, it's ok."
"One of the best games out there. Crazy, random, fun, hats, unlockables, co-op, great community, never gets old, great and different ways to play. Go on get it, its free."
"This is probably the best free to play game! If it costed money it would cost 100$ for the fun, graphics, characters and classes!"
yes a fun and classic f2p game
"Awesome game, I've dedicated so much time and enjoyement into it for the following system:  POSITIVE: -Reward system -Amazing diversity in gameplay styles -So many different weapons  -Many different battlefields to play on, suiting any personal style -So... many... EASTER EGGS! -Can be played in competitive -It's freaking free! -Highly inspired by the community that plays it -A lot of people don't focus on the game -A whole ingame trading system, and community market -Addictive -Nice people -Personality in each class  NEGATIVE: -A lot of people don't focus on the game -Scammers in trading (but it's not the games fault) -Items are REALLY expensive in the store (thankfull there's the community market that normally sells it cheaper) -Addictive -Many people that are unexperienced in the game (called 'noobs') -Mean people (not the game's fault)"
"it's cool game like CS:GO.but it's gonna be awsome with zombies! so please valve update Team Fortess 2 with please get on the job make half life 3, update this game and we be awsome"

This is a revoloutionary game and its suprising it took 3 final looks,the Game has great functions and the more you play the more hats,weapons and taunts you will get. And almost everybody on Steam has this game in their library.Get it now so that you can get more stuff faster!"
"The rockets represent the hardships and malice that the soldier has been weighted with throughout his life of war. He doesn't believe what his eyes are telling him. All they show is limitation, the heavy burden of only succeeding with violence. He looks with understanding, to find out what he already knows, that his violence is essential for the team, for survival. And then he sees the way to fly."
Really great game! I recommend it! Really fun if you play with friends or different game modes!
"I honestly recommend Team fortress 2. I bought it with the Orange box on the release day which would have been 10 euro, but I would pay 60 for it aswell. Since the game is Free to Play now you need to try it out.  I am disappointed in the fact that it is free to play now though, the difficulty level has drasticaly changed to low standards due to all the new players. Other than that it is a nice game when you're bored"
This game ruined my life
Great game 5 stars :)
This ♥♥♥♥in game is like taking a ♥♥♥♥ after holding it for a long time. ♥♥♥♥ing great. This game is just so ♥♥♥♥ing amazing you can Conga with the enemy team and make your character look like a fairy. 10/10 ♥♥♥♥ing amazing
ghetto people attacked me in voice chat
this game sucks cuz i cant quickscope ppl and there are op guns and spy is op cuz he can 1shot u and the othr classes r just bad
"One class defeats the other, There is never an overpowered class when you know how to use them all..  I preferably, love Soldier, Pyro, Medic, Demo, Scout, and Spy, All to which require skill..  The game is quite fun because you can do all sorts of things and not only PVP, Such as.. SlenderFortress, Rocket Jumping(Which is one of my favorites), Mann Vs. Machine, and so much more!!  This game by valve has been quite successful ever since its release and would continue playing it!!  If you're new to the game, i recommend you playing CTP or CTF, maps, You won't regret it! (:"
I Laughed I Cried.... Then i got a jar of ♥♥♥♥ thrown at me     10/10 would jarate again
"I tellya folks, after fighin at the Alamo along side that pompus wind bag Travis, this game is a pure joy, i reckon."
you can conga in it. 11/10
It's ok.
it's alright I guess
"God, almost 1000 hours in this game, i think that's the way to say: ''This game is so much fun, you can play for hours and not even know for how much time you've played until you see your record'' 10/10 HIGHLY Recommended&lt;3"
I love this game &lt;3 THE BEST EVER :)
"So fun over 1,000 people play it and i think you should to #Great Game"
"Entertaining, addicting must-have game"
"Are you tierd of your standard qick scope, camoflage and camping fights like in call of duty? Sick of all the Proos sqating above your face in games like Halo and Unreal T?  Then dos steam have something fore you to day. This was once a not free2play game, but now it is, and it is one of the best and diverce shooters, you wil see.  It has a bunch of gamemodes, so you will allway have new stuf to check out. It has 9 classes, so you are sure to find AT A MINIMUM of 3 that you willl like.  You can equip everi class with new weapons that you get as (drop or achivments).  I sudgest playng againts bots fore some time, so you can se each class specificly, and so you won't get creamed by online competetive play.   This game.....DOS NOT CARE ......abaut youre kill death ratio. It isn't displayed aniwere doring game time. So the best way to get points, is to reach your TEAM goal.....Thats why its called TEAM fortres."
Best free game out there
Can't get enough of Hat simulator!
I may never see the sun again after this   10/10  -New York Times
"is ♥♥♥♥, please do not download"
"Team Fortress 2 is one of the best games I have ever had the luck to come across a must have for anyone intersted in well balanced, stlyeized and fast paced FPS.....and hats  Honestly there really is nothing I can say that hasn't already been said, it is just really great.     "
This Game is so Cool
"I will play this game and never change my favourite game, be a pro."
i love this game
"My hours. help.  I wrote something for real!  These hours are legit, I played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life. I was young and didn't really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and I had a really bad pc, which i still own. TF2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics, but it was one of the more fun games I installed. I met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side. The community back then was more humble compared to nowadays. You have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunny/gross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game. When really, it doesn't even matter if you win or lose. However, you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way! Although you never know what kinda person you're going to meet on this game. In my honest opinion, if you want to have a game to just waste time on (and money) or just mess around with people you know (which is what I do now), this is perfect. Esspecially the mann vs. machine co-op. I mainly play that now. Although to me, the game lost its touch, update wise, and I moved onto other games.   I believe it's worth a shot to try it out but other than that, I'd keep it as a casual game. I don't think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because it's being flooded by crude people. Atleast from my experiance after over about 2+ years of playing it just got worse and worse. You will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it. You'll be more stressed than actually having fun, I'll tell you that!  Although in all seriousness, this game is losing its touch and probably isn't worth making it your main game MAINLY because the updates they've been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be. BUT, it's a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun! All you'll really notice nowdays is...people really love to trade more than actually play. Living off as a free to play would be very tough and you'd need to be patient with items you would want, unless you got that MONEY! Hope this helps.   One last thing, I am not saying this game is bad in any way. I am saying that it's worth trying and playing with friends, or even meeting people! Although there are some downsides that you won't like, such as some stuff I pointed out above. Strictly towards the community. I personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing. Have it as a once in a while game, because it's nothing to be big about, unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there.   Just give it a shot and see what you think! Have fun"
great game good players
Its very good game. but valve gamemode is not that well. community mode is nicer than valve
I love this game mainly because all the different items you can find  I really wish a third comes out and that there will be more classes
Really great game for having a bunch of fun with random weapons that have their own unique effects. The possibility of turning the tides on your enemies brings such satisfaction to this fps.
This maybe a classic one but this GAME really ROCKS one of the best games ever made ^_^
"Addictive and fun, Recommend dis"
i realy lke how it is free
Not pay to win but dress good to be known as a good player. (y)
"This game is absolutely amazing. For those of you turned off by needed to buy something from the store to get premium, you can get it for less then 50 cents. The kits are well balanced, the achievements are fun, and the weapons are awesome. Hope to see you online!"
its free its fun what more do you want
I LOVE THIS GAME  its really funny its FREE it has good graphics very addictive i would be very suprised to see if anyone doesnt hvae friends convincing them to buy it because its AWESOME!
"Constatntly playing this game. There's a bit of a learning curve for new players, so keep with it if you want to improve. Still buggy and the community is toxic at times, but otherwise, a great game and time/money waster."
"Team Fortress 2 is such an addicting game. When I first played it on my old PC, it was freaking laggy, I thought it would be a boring game. My friend kept asking me to play it when I got a new PC, but I had doubts because of how big the file size is. I decided to play it anyway. It was freaking fun! I couldn't stop playing! All the game modes are cool, all the classes are good in their own way. My KDR in TF2 is good unlike in other FPS games where I'm horrible. I recommend playing this game, it's a shame if you can't run it, but it is worth trying :)"
I'll pootis quite short and simple state; I've been playing video games since The Amiga days and this game is one of the best games I've ever played also the best&amp;most fun online FPS game.
"Really fun game! So many different modes to play, never gets boring 10/10"
"2 Teams, 9 classes and a ton of maps and weapons to choose from ensure that this game has everything for any kind of player! I have also met quite a few good friends on Tf2, to me Tf2 is one of the best games out there solely because of the amazing community... The hours I have played speaks for itself!!! It's free GO GET THIS GAME!!!!!"
"Strong individuality, good balance. I can feel the energy of Quake from this game. 6/10"
Love this game! I have played this for 85 hrs on record. I would play more but my laptop broke and im stuck with this HORRIBLE computer. Best F2P EVER
Definitely a game.
The game is a great way to meet other members of steam. The gameplay is also great
I am Team Fortress 2
"Honestly Team Fortress 2 was my first game on Steam and I haven't played many other games other than this. TF2 is amazing, period. If you like competition, Conga, and items acquired through hard work, you will like this game. But once you start becoming a competitive player, you should master at least 3 different classes, one from each category. Other than that, TF2 is a must try game."
Its An Verry Awesome Game  I Recome it for everbody :D
10/10
"This is game is awesome. Theres a lot of classes with a bunch of weapons. You can also costmize your charter, there very awesome."
This is the best game i have literally ever played. So glad its around.
"Team Fortress 2 is a fun first person shooter; unless you go online.   Well... let me elaborate, Team Fortress 2 is a solid game, no arguing that. Good controls, nice class balancing and dynamics, a good (not perfect) F2P model, 9 classes each with different sub-classes, even a good tutorial for beginners and uncommon classes in the game. However, the problems arise in the game's community. If you do choose to click that Find Server or Play Now button be warned. This community, while not being all bad, can be infuriating. Hackers, while not being everywhere, are a massive pain and they will ruin your game. Play to Play elitism is commonplace and you will be called out for not having 'Good Hats' or being made fun of because you are new to the game. Yes, there are good people in the community that are willing to help you enjoy this game, but its easier finding someone that wont. If you do go online, bring a friend with you that knows how the game works and can help along the way. There are even good groups and clans you can join for beginners to enjoy the game at their pace.  I could go on and on about other issues such as this game's community slowly shrinking, the issue with hat filled updates, and ducks, but I don't want to drive off new players. So give it a shot already! It's even free so there's no big deal!"
"Ahh. Team Fortress 2; Everyone's favourite Hat Simulator with a nifty First-Person-Shooter Minigame built in. Team Fortress 2 is a fast-paced team-based multiplayer FPS with 9 different classes to choose from, all of which have a miniature army's worth of weapons to choose from. Not only that, but there are plenty of different Maps and Gamemodes (Maps are the playing fields that everyone is located on) to choose from. From the depths of the Badlands to the peacefulness (As peaceful as a war between two teams of gun-wielding psychopathes can be, anyway) of Suijin, if you like hats, guns, beautiful levels, class variety and hats, Team Fortress 2 is definitely the game to play. Now about those hats... (And the best part is that it's FREE TO PLAY! :D)"
I love this game!
I would recommend this game for its funny characters and frequent updates of unique weapons and items.
"So after 800 hours of playing i will finally give my Opinion about the Free to Play Multiplayer Fun Shooter Team Fortress 2.So i will begin with the Pros. =============================================== -It is Free to Play. -Valve put much Humor into the game. -Free Updates without any costs. -Many Maps/Weapons/Cosmetics/Hats and Gamemodes. =============================================== But as a Free to Play Game it has to have Cons. =============================================== -There are so many Pay to Win aspects. -No Singleplayer. (Only Offline with bots where are only 3 gamemodes) -The Developer ralely listens to the community. =============================================== I give 8,5/10 Points. ==============================================="
"This is truely, one of the best games that I've ever played. With goofy characters, awesome classes and weapons, and super fun multiplayer, this game is an absolute masterpiece! Plus, you don't even need a great computer to run it! I run this game on my laptop on medium to high settings, and I get around 50 FPS! I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves first person shooters, and enjoys collecting and showing off their items!"
Its free....
"God, where to begin?  Team Fortress 2 is a multi-player, fast-paced 'first person shooter' that 'encourages' 'team-play' and 'working together'.  This game has brightened my life for the better because of all the friends I've made, the wide variety of maps, weapons and custom gamemodes, the many, many, many dumb and completely irrational ideas in our world take place in Team Fortress 2.  For example, Spycrabs, Pyrosharks, beating a portly Russian man with a baseball bat as he eats a sandwich. There are so many things to look forward to in this godly-yet-dumb-as-all-living-hell game that will have you laughing your head off in a matter of minutes.  Team Fortress 2 is constantly updated (albiet with some controversial nerfs or buffs) and every time you hop on after a major overhaul of new stats for your favourite weapons, or a new class being able to wear your favourite hat is so refreshing and exhilarating. The community behind the games works so hard to create new and fun content for this game that is well over 8 years old.  Team Fortress 2 is such a lively game with so many wacky moments that make you just want to chuckle.  And I wouldn't want it any other way."
If u like fps play this game :3
¿wanna have a great game who have everything? download TF2 now! is the best game i ever played
Its a good time waster.
"I wish i could say i would recommend this game to you,but if you never played since,basicly TF2 is done.  Why?: With the newer updates and such TF2 has became more of a Trading Games instead of the good old Combat Game.TF2 is taking his last breaths.There is no fun anymore like the fun you would get back in the day.No more Valve Server (except those shity Casual Servers),Trading Based Community Servers(%60 of the servers are trade servers),Buffing and Nerfing characters unneceseraly which ♥♥♥♥ed it up(for exampl the phylogistanor,it suck right now,im serious check it out).  What Are People Doing?: They are either going to CSGO or Dota2 as Valve games or other games such as Call Of Duty,BattleField or Indie Games.Because they are sick and tide of their favourite game becoming a trading game(im being ♥♥♥♥ing serious,go check the community server's list ffs).And what is valve's respond to this?'♥♥♥♥ that,lets do some unneeded buffs,unneeded nerfs,lets add some new hats cosmetics and ♥♥♥♥ like that lol'.They atleast tryed it with the new competetive game place which sucks to be  honest,why?   Valve Server's : If you have been in any of those you'll know what i am trying to say.THEY SUCK,they are laggy as ♥♥♥♥,legit they are so bad,you atleast have 200-300 ping everysingle time you try to play it.  The Shity Ranking System : The ranking system doesnt realy work like how it is suposed to be,what a ranking system is is where you will be playing wih players who are at the SAME RANK as you are,not lower,not higher.  Overall: From now on TF2 never will be as good as it was,and you have missed a big thing if you never tryed it.It is slowly dying and may never be as big as it was  R.I.P. TF2 2007-2016"
"One of my top games of all time!  When i first started playing the game i wasnt that into it. Ill admit, i thought it was kinda meh back then, but after like 20 hours i was completly sold on it, and ive loved it ever since. Its diffrent from all those other Medal of DutyField thats all about killing eachother. Its not as serious and compedetive and i love that. And now they are introducing a compedetive gamemode like the one in CSGO so that all the tryhards can play there and the Hoovey can stay and eat their sandwiches. But to sum this up give the game a try, dont give up after half an hour keep playing the game for a while and ill promise you will love it! Thats all for me, thank you for your time."
"This game is a very exciting multiplayer FPS shooter. Wherever you are, there'll always be action going on. The way they portray each class is amazing. Their personalities are unique and have a different style/strategy to how you play."
"Thanks to the new update the game might as well be a different one. - chancer matchmaking and pubbing - Medic changes xD - purposely cripple community server  Thank you valve, you did what blizzard couldn't do :D was it worth to run behind a tf2 clone?  -edit: warhuryeah:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HY3zwK0_bXI "
"This Game is a good shoot game,Tf2 Is Love Tf2 is Life!LOL!"
This is the best 1st person shooter game ever!
420/10 too many hats -IGN best hat simulator awards 2016
this game is an amazing fps with taunts and really cool maps
back on the wild ride  ♥♥♥♥
Great game I like how you can find items as well as crafting &amp; buying them &amp; customizable classes :D

pretty good
Great game.
Many games have based their multiplayer gameplay off this game. One of the best free2play games on Steam. :D
I've met so many cute gay guys to kiss on this game.
"TF2 is very addicting. After you win your first game, you want to play more. Of the hours I've played, I've learned all new ways to win and have fun. The store has awesome things. After you buy something from the store, your account becomes premium and you can find very rare items. With all the things that happen, The constant updates and the custom maps, TF2 is the perfect game to when your bored or looking for action."
"I honestly play this game way too much. I've had this game since the begging of my days on steam, and I'm still playing it way too much.  Pros: team based, balanced classes (sort of), hats Cons: crit rockets, hats, crit rockets   Now crit rockets are awesome if you shoot them. But 90 percent of the time, your not.   Long live Gaben.  "
"I'm really liking the new 'If you don't want to play competitive then ♥♥♥♥ you' update. The game was amazing, until now.. You just had to get rid of quickplay, and force us to use what you want.. You got rid of the best part of the game, being able to do ANYTHING on there. You could go on server to literal, JUST TALK! Now you can't.. Thanks Valve.."
"This is an amazing game that once you play it for a while gets VERY addicting and if you get a little advanced and get good at it gets even MORE fun to play, all in all this is my favorite game and you should totally get it if you are reading this because its free FOREVER and you don't play for a bit and have to pay-to-play because its free-to-play and not some crappy boring game that you beat in 5 minutes because you CANT beat Team fortress 2! And that's the awesome thing about it!"
"This is my favourite game. Compared to TFC, its more fun and beautiful. In older version, it was a war game and every character was serious as hell. But in TF2, every caharacter has a style and hundreds of items to make you customize your style. You can even high-five with your enemy :) And yes, it is made by Valve, the best game developer ever."
Just Horrible
"The recent updates have caused me to change my vote. The developers do not care about the game or the community. Stay away. Will change my position if they can make this game fun again.  Recent update have fostered a more hateful community, more money grabbing, more evidence that the devs don't play the game(or listen to players), and overall have made the game so unenjoyable for me that i do not play anymore."
"Very good game, Very fun with lots of different play style options :D I have made a lot of friends through this game"
One of the best hat theme war simulator i´ve ever played!! 
"Nothing bad to say, some weapons need a nerf tho like the demon shield and stuff. but a really nice game to play for hoooouuuurs."
I recommend this game because its fun and how it shows versatility and usefulness of every class
My friend killed me with a sign that had a picture of my face on it .... 10/10 would die again.
  its very good game
"Yes, this game is fun. At first, going to a server MAY tell you you are a noob because your a F2P ( I Find It More On Servers ). Well, YOUR NOT GONNA GIVE UP TO THAT RIGHT?! So Buy a Hat, Show it Off, Fight, Dominate, Join Tournaments, Play with 500+ Robot Attackers, Defend, Trade, Duel. And Ofcourse HAVE FUN!  99/10 10 Stars 9m Likes Thumbs UP  Thats all i got"
"I really love team fortress 2. It's by far, my favorite of any other game I've ever played. There's just nothing like tf2, there never will be anything like it. I've been playing it for over 6 years on and off, I play now more than ever. It's been my favorite game since I first started playing it, December 27th, 2009. There's so much to love about this wonderful masterpiece of a game. Each of the nine classes have their own unique abilities, wacky personalities, weapons and cosmetics. There's tons of various official and non-official community created content that's been added throughout the years by the tf2 development team and people from the community. Examples of that are game modes, cosmetics, maps, various weapons, skins and much more. A big part of the game for me other than gameplay itself, trading. The addition of trading and additional content over the years has made the game so much more diverse than it originally was. Some may think that's a bad thing, to me it's made the game even more enjoyable. It's astonishing that it's now over 8 years old and still receives frequent content updates and patches to this day. I will always love and support this game until I'm the one of the last people playing it. A huge thanks to my awesome brother for giving me the best christmas present ever all those years ago. I cannot even express how highly I recommend this game, a very well-deserved 10/10."
The game is so great i didnt even feel that its bad to the players more and more will come in the future add this game and try it!
"I been play TF2 one Year for now =D but i hate Hacker aimbot so much ...but lucky they can vote kick aimbot hacker ==  Most my favor Class : Spy , Sniper &amp; Medic Less i play class its Heavy....sry ...im not go belive but too much choose ....yea =["
"After last update ('Meat vs match' or 'Meet your match' - whatever) this sucks.  i live in kenya and i dont play game but tf2. after update, i need to wait for game forever. and i couldn't find any good-ping server. (last game was in Dubai ffs)   at least i could join 3 ping-bars (on the learder board) server in that time, but not anymore. f*ck you gaben, build server in africa or i quit."
I was really excited for the new update but the first match I get into has 6 cheaters on the enemie team. DO NOT PLAY! IT'S A CHEATER INFESTED CRAPHOLE!
The updates are sending this game straight through the nine circles of hell. still fun though
"this game is dead with the new update, better off playing overwatch this game is staying uninstalled until pubs come back"
"Ever since this update, this game has gone down hill, I LOVE TF2, dont get me wrong, but I can't even get on a quote unquote casual server without it taking over 40 minutes to just find one. They now have normal game servers be looked up like how they do in MvMm, which takes a long time. BUT THIS TAKES SO MUCH LONGER. They added a leveling system... alright alright... BUT ON CASUAL? NO! It makes no sense whatsoever! Competitive, good luck trying to get on that. Mann Vs. Machine hasn't been touched thank god. Oh yeah, try and play the ONE gamemode you want to play... wait... nope, you have to have at least 2 selected to actually get on a normal game, so you have a 50/50 chance to play what you want. Like I said prior, I LOVE TF2, but this update is crap, so any new players wanting to play this game would see this update and think, 'Why do people love this, this is horrible!' So I can no longer recommend this game until this crap is FIXED! Thank you for taking your time in reading this long review/rant. I hope the TF2 Community will realize their own ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and fix their mistakes."
Theres been a new update and it sukz
"If I wanted to wait an hour to play a casual match only to wait another 30 minutes to join another server,   I would be playing Runescape.   ♥♥♥♥ the new update"
"I've been playing for about a year and a half now, on and off. I used this as a game I could start up and be playing within 5 minutes, tops. Now, I cannot. Competitive matchmaking in the newest update has killed the game for me, not because I am not a fan of it, but because I cannot even get into an official server anymore.  I have waited on the casual play screen for 10 minutes. It showed me how many players were online and how many players I was compatible with based on my modes selected. And then I waited another 9 minutes for something to happen. I have faith that they will fix this issue within the week, but until then, it seems I am unable to play."
"Before the update, favorite shooter pc game out there After the update, not even gonna play this game anymore  As they said in the new update 'Make tf2 great again' - undo this awful update  If you truly want to make tf2 great again. DOWNGRADE TF2 TO ITS ORIGINAL STATE"
THIS GAME IS SO EPIC AND REALLY FUN
"This game is the only thing I play and there is a reason for that. I got this game around October and I have been hooked since.This is also the first game I have ever spent money on. What are you waiting for, just get the game."
Casual mode replaced the quickpaly system.
"TF2 IS BROKEN  I don't have any more fun with TF2 now, TF2 is not any more a fun gane because 'QUICKMATCHS' have benn replaced for a 'CASUAL MODE' what have ranks and are unbalanced for a new player or peolpe what want to train his abilitys and get better. 'Casual mode' u muss wait so long to join and u get cooldown if u leave this don't have sence ,my friends say also that uptade is brocken. But i cann also say that uptade make better things reskins, competive or ranks, but VALVE GIVE OUR QUICKMATCH BACK. VALVE GIVE OUR QUICKMATCH BACK AND REVOME THE RANK SYTEAM ON THE QUICKMATCH MODE PLS. #VOLVO (IF YOU WANT QUICKMATCH LIKE BEFORE)"
I LUV THIS GAME Its a fun game and hats are all you need to have fun :D
"This is probably one of the best games I have ever played. I have met many friends playing this game, and I will never forget the laughs I shared with them. From an amazing fanbase with thousands of contributions to the hat simulator this game is, I can guarantee you that this game will NOT be a waste of your time.  moist"
can't recommend this game to anyone who wants a casual experience
"used to be my favorite game, until the matchmaking update. now all i want to do with it is mann versus machine, and even then that's not a compelling enough reason to keep playing like i used to. there were so many things this game needed from valve, and this last update was not one of them. who knew that, in the end, valve themselves would be the tf2 killer?"
"This game is good when you first start playing. The gameplay is great with lot's of fun weapons and playstyles, and the characters have a lot of personality. But after a while it gets repetitive stale. The recent updates didn't help the game either for many reasons. Until Valve communicates a little more with the community I sadly cannot recommend this game anymore"
all im going to say is this has left bitter sour taste in my mouth the removal of pubs and the party system still being wonky and the inability to ad-hoc connect to casual servers kinda seems a bit like a ♥♥♥♥ move and right now im unsure whether to stay or leave  long and the short of it if your unsure about tf2 wait till next update
"This game is great but I can no longer recommend it due to the new update. Let me describe it to you. You log in, and find the new server browser is gone, you are now forced to pick from competitive, or causual. choose either, GUESS WHAT HAPPENS! Nothing, literally nothing for about 20 minutes, you will sit their while the game find a server for you. 20 MINUTES!!! it's like valve is shoving a cactus up your ♥♥♥ and calling it a better style of gameplay. For you new people the game used to be like, log in, click on gamemode you want to play, wait 1 minute for the server to load, and BAM! your in for as long as you want to play. But now once the game ends you can't play anymore. you have to go through trying to find a new server which will take another 20 minutes! I could go to college, get a PHD, buy a house, pay off the house, become rich and buy Valve and fix this stupid update before I get on a server! Seriously I doubt anyone likes the new update."
"The team fortress 2 experience for me was really amazing at the start. Going on random public community servers gave me unpredictable games and players with the mindset of 'fun'. though saltiness came around sometimes, there was always a way to start a conga line in spawn.It was almost as if the community made tf2 what it WAS before the updates.   I would totally recommend this game not until updates came by to ruin the game's experience. I started believing the developers at this game gave up on listening to it's customers. And when the phlog got a stupid buff I threw the game out of my daily list of 'what to play'. But when I heard the Meet Your Match update was announced it felt really dead. At least for me. When they took out pub servers and the ideal of 'fun' this game almost resembles the competitive playstyle of csgo and/or overwatch. I really miss the old random, fun, and silly tf2. They really need to listen to their customers..."
  It is awesome.
Easy to get into and fun.

"This game has acompanied me for 2 years, it cheers me up whenever i'm sad. Thanks tf2."
"This is the most unrealistic, weirdest, dumbest, cluster ♥♥♥♥ game ever  666/7  Best game ever made ;)"
if you want a life i recommend you don't play this game
i &lt;3 this game
this isnt minecraft
"will not take me into an online match, when it does it works for a few minutes and than crashes"
"This game is good son real good, maybe even the best"
The new upadate is suck. Matchmaking take forever.
This is honestly one of the best class based multiplayer games there is! Easy to pick up and play! And very hard to stop playing as well.  5 stars
"Hat Simulator 2014 is an interesting, engaging game where you trade hat for hat, hat for key, key for hat, hat for metal, metal for hat, and metal for key, and much more. Also has FPS elements but nobody cares about them. Get Hat Simulator 2014 today for a true hat experience like you never could in real life."
"2007: Simple game with 9 classes and basic maps and weapons, nothing else.  2014: War themed hat simulator"
this is a very fun and creative game to play ( clocked up over 1000 hours ) hope you will enjoy it as much as i did
"TL;DR Valve ♥♥♥♥ed up TF2 for now. :)   An amazing game that holds its glory until today, but I can't say the same about it's developers.  The Meet Your Match update ♥♥♥♥ed many people over. Valve took away one of the main things in this game. Public Servers/Pubs. It was the main source of enjoyment for me, and many other people. The only thing they've made this patch is get the MM (Matchamaking) out of the 'Beta', but it's not valve if there aren't any flaws. The MM is broken. You may get deranked after winning, the skill levels are really mixed up, etc. etc. And they managed to kill pubs and shove Casual gamemode up our arses and expected everyone to be happy.   Valve has ♥♥♥♥ed up a bunch of times in last patches. But this patch holds the 'Worst' title so far for me and many other people. :)  EDIT:  Now that Valve removed the penalties of quitting a casual match, and the freaking queue times are lower now we can actually play something close to pubs. Which is something for me atleast. Waiting for further fixes so not changing my recommendation ATM"
"This game is great,here are somethings you need to know before playing this game  1.Playing this game competitive may result in your keyboard and or mouse being broken   2.Always expect your teammates to be dancing in the spawn room while you are actually figting   3.You do not have to spend money on this game,it's totally not a P2W...but,you WILL spend money on this game"
you can get a hat
"I think I'm just at 2000+ hours and I've gotta say I haven't played a game thats more fun than Team Fortress 2. Especially for the price!  Not only does this game have tons of different game modes such as Capture Point, King of The Hill, Capture The Flag(Intel), Pay Load, Arena (basically Death match), And a Wave-Defence mode called MannVsMachine (MVM), The classes each have multiple play styles making them very versitile for ANY situation you may face.  Get some friends together and this game can be a real blast. Once you find a 'good' server with friendly players you'll want to add that one to your favorites and *become a regular*. Usually regulars get benefits, which could include  visual effects, auto balance immunity, end-of-round immunity . Some servers even have plug-ins that give your character an in-game effect (Good or Bad, like instant kills! or you may shrink down to ankle high, maybe a giant head? low gravity anybody?.. and anywhere in between!)  I forgot to mention all the constant updates, Weapons, Hats, big community, Hats, promotional items, and so much more.  in short: If you dont have this game, go ahead and hit yourself for not having it and start the download. Then Go make a tasty sandwich of your choice (don't forget to toast the bread), grab a glass of tea, and commence waiting for your next favorite game to finish."
1) Pootis  2) Hats  3) Bird heads.  Nuff said.
"Many firstperson shooters feel the same: you're the only one that matters; any weapon will kill in one to two hits; the game takes itself way to seriously; the main goal is KILL, KILL, KILL. Overall, it seems to me that most FPS genre games are lacking a bit in the diversity department. Team Fortress 2 addresses that by giving you a crazy, colorful, whacked-out, and unpredictable world to screw around in. With nine classes to choose from, each with his own arsenal of specialized (and sometimes hilarious) guns, bombs, and blunt instruments to do battle with, you're presented with countless different play styles. Customizing the mercenaries with nonsensical wardrobe changes is a big part of the game as well; just visualize a giant, brutish man wearing a tutu! Team Fortress 2 also encourages a team dynamic of sorts. While you can go off on your own and sucseed, coordination with other players is vital, as each class has his own way(s) to help out his fellow mercenary. I know, this is quite the exstensive review on a free game, but please heed my word and give this a shot. I'm certain you'll enjoy it!"
"Life...No, Team Fortress 2! Who needs anything, but the most beautiful of assorted Hats and Apperal? Team Fortress 2 is an amazing and humerous 1st Person Shooter, a must play in my book!"
"10/10, would hat again."
"This game... I think the hours say it all. It's fun, but difficult against better players- it makes you want to keep getting better. Very highly recommended."
"Before i heard of this game, I Was never interested in first person shooters. But i have to give a Big thank you to my friend Dispoonser. He was the one who told me about this Land of MAGIC! I never seen a shooter game with Such a Great Back story. Even the Classes you play as have A unqie Story Behind them! The weapons and Cosmetics Are all Different and function in there own ways. With Gamemodes like payload Where You have to defend a cart form Falling into a hatch or you help Deploy the bomb into the hatch. Or you can play Mvm, A co-op Mode where you fight multiply waves Of Humanoid robots and tanks. Trust me you will fall in love with this game!"
yea get it
Ok lets start with the pros so team fortress 2 is all about team work even when you dont know that your working you are because you are doing the objective secoundly you can customize you charcter with cosmetics such as hats and clothing there are many hats and some can get pretty expensive unless you earn them in game they can go as high as 145 $ yay thats expensive and lastly for the pros each chacter has its ups in down i dont wanna get to deep in but they each are unique now lets head over to the cons now there can sometimes be bugs and glitchs but besides the point it kind of like a freemium game with u having to buy things if you want more but thats an option there are many game modes in tf2 incudeing the new mvm i think this is just a great game so if you have a chance check it out and im giving this game a 9 out of 10 check it out and thanks for reading this review
Cool stuff. And Recently Updates  10/10
This game is so awesome ! :)
"This game is flat out amazing! Once you start it has training for 4 of the 9 classes, which helps you learn the controls and tactics of the 4, but still letting you learn the other 5! There is plenty of content being added to keep the game fresh and stylish, while not to complicated. Whether you like online multiplayer, or offline singleplayer, this game has both in the form of offline training with bots and online.   10/10 would waste my life again"
Ugh.
It's alright.
"Tf2. It's a MUST if you want online, first person shooters - That are comedic, and not have Squeaking kids saying 'GET REKT' to the point of breaking windows-. Well, there ARE squeakers, but not NEARLY as bad as most think -Shhhhhh, Experienced Tf2 Players, they can't know-. Team Fortress 2 is a class based, customizable FPS that has varieties of Gamemode, playstyles and Cosmetics. It's customization is AMAZING, but the only problem is, Free to plays don't have nearly as much reign in customization as others, and are easily discriminated in the community. BUT, either way there are weopons, cosmetics, skins, and more with varying forms, like Stranges, which rank up every time they have something completed, Unusuals, items with special effects with high value. There are combonations of weopons which can make the game..... slightly less fair, but can be countered with work. Even with my hundreds of hours on this game, it's hard to describe as a player, but the best I can do is recommend it to all. Enjoy Tf2!"
Fun game. That is all you need to know
This game is great funny fun funky I give it a 10/10 -Pug games
What is outside?
"The best game I've ever played, and I've played a lot. There's so much to learn and so much to do. It will take years to get bored and the game and it's contantly being updated. Get the Free-to-play version of the game, have a friend teach you the ropes and then upgrade to Premium if you like it. You have nothng to lose and everything to gain.  Lt. Maverick - BOOM! Gaming &amp; Technology Community"
"All I can say about Team Fortress 2, it's really fun to play. I enjoy playing this game on Steam! :)"
"You thought this game is good? Well you are wrong... It's f***ing awsome!!! You never get bored with this:) And it's free to play, what else do you want?!!?!"
a wonderfull game. everyone should own this.
Love it.
It is a very good guame
Bargaining for hats simulator 2014 10/10
"After countless hours of playing , i'm very dissapointed of what Valve made. Last update really broke the fun I used to have , doing a quick match of 5-10 minutes , changes your servers and the gamemode, and also...selecet the map you want to play ?! ...  RIP Team Fortress 2 (2007-2016)"
it is really fun
This game spell my brain so... It's the best free game in Steam)
"This was my first and favorite game I had played on steam, and I am absolutely heartbroken that I have to not recommend it to newcomers.  Valve, the communication between you, and your players is absolutely horrendous. It's like the last updates did the complete opposite of what your community wanted. Your players have put so much faith in your team to keep making this game so good! Yet, you have crushed all of it in failing to listen to the community. Your Match Making is horrible, your penalties for players who bail on ranked is laughable, and the ranked is riddled with hackers.   Well. It was fun, goodbye, old friend."
hours of fun 
"This game is a massive online multiplayer experience i will never forget. this war basded, hat simulater is what made me a pc gamer. its free to play, people get the game!!!!"
"Great game! Love everything about it. but what I love most of all is that there is no super high jumps, I mean who hates the people in games that jump around"
"The most fun I've ever had with a game. There are countless things to do and with this game continuing to expand, I don't believe it can get a whole lot better!"
"Was a pretty fun game until Valve removed most of it for a half-baked competitive mode and casual matchmaking where the queues can be as long as the game. Performance continues to get worse with every strand of spaghetti code Valve add to the heap, and the moronic decision to start enforcing things like viewmodel FOV just makes it harder to configure a game that's comfortable for you. I would've recommended this game in the past, but now? You're better off not wasting your time."
"Ah the old debate, is TF2 worth your time? Well, ive played for years and I will help answer this for you. Yes, but no. In the end it depends on what you like. I personally think that even if you might dislike the game, at least try it. It is very well made and enjoyable. The art style is nice and cartoony if you like that, but the game is a nice break no matter what. it perfects the term 'casual' but at the same time can be played competetivly if you look into the community more. Even if you play serious games, try it, there is no reason not to because its free! -ryry228"
"TL;DR: Negative reviewers are people either banned, bandwagoning or crying because they thought terrible Valve quickplay servers were the entire game.  Still as good as ever, 99% of negative reviews are from people that got VAC'd or people that cry over any little change made to the game, don't let the tears of random valve server pubbers sway you from playing this game, bear in mind the people crying over quickplay being removed are the same people that cried when it was added to begin with. The new system for 'casual' matches works a lot better than quickplay and is being improved all the time, and even if you don't like it, there are tons of community servers all over the world if you aren't too lazy to look for them."
I LOVE THIS GAME
"Very good game, best Hat Simulator ever, you can paint, set style, go on dates and see your hat's mood. I'm so glad that they added Frostbite 3 to it, and that this game is on for casual players. Well, the last part is not entirely true, even though the game was never meant to be played competitively, IT IS being played competitively, ever since late 2006. Valve just don't want to take this game 'seriously' like they did with Counter-Strike. Many, and when I say many I mean it, I bloody hell mean it, MANY Quake veterans moved from Quake to this game but I think they got upset that their old comp tournaments weren't there anymore and that the comp community wasn't official. Valve, please, listen to all the players asking for it, I know that you've heard it many times before, even when Sal and eXtine went to your office just to ask this, make TF2 official, this game has a HUGE community, this game has HUGE potential, come on, look at all those game gimmicks, but you can't deny that Highlander is a lot less strategic than 6v6 and that it'll be a pain to assemble and manage 9 players for each team, instead of 6."
  Team Fortress 2 Review
Good game to play 9/10 :D DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE HATS AND UNUSUAL
If you dont play this you are a dumbass get on it and download it. Go ahead i am waiting.
Great game. Allows you to waste your life murdering others. I've been killing for 1000+ hours.
i hate this game.
Ruined my life and cost me over £300.  10/10 would recommend to my worst enemies.
*gets fairly good at the game* *comes back after about a month* *gets rekt* i cried evrytime  9.7/10  it's decent  
"Team Fortress 2 is the best game that lacks any (obvious) nudity, and you should play it and spend money on hats and Fight Club it out.   Yes."
It's cool because it is mostly customizable... if u hate a certain character u don't have to play that person... there's other members! Not to mention you can change the weapon they carry if you unlock them. ALSO it is free!!! i don't know what the hell is better than free games..... free is my second favorite f word!
"THIS GAME HELPS ME SATE MY HUNGER FOR CRUSHING NOOBS, I APPROVE.     Cheers"
A haiku:  This game contains hats They took over my damn life 7/10
"I think this is the most fun you can have in online gaming. The integration of community-made maps &amp; items will keep you cumming... I mean, uh, coming back for more."
Best free to play ever made its a must have! their is a ton of guns and hats with downside and benefits i love the pyro is my favorite character! 10/10 would recommend to friends and family
I like this game
The conga almost made me forget about hats. Almost. 10/10
This game is beast!! definetly download it! 
"If this game was a sandwich, it would be a very good sandwich."
Fantastic way to kill time
"awesome! it is an amazing game that everyone should have. Also, HATS!! "
Team Fortress 2 The Best Funny Game Ever ! Love IT and the Items and Economy Rullz and Kick ♥♥♥ ! GG
"Honestly, majority of the fun you will get from this game is dependent on the server and community you join.  You eventually find the one you love and years pass and you realized - I've been playing for so long, and I love it.  "
Spent all my money on hats and now i'm homeless. 10/10.
"I LOVED THIS GAMES!! for almost ten years.  BUt you had to Keep changing it and adding stuff, I get it you need to make money, and I understand that.  But this newest change is a full on MONEY GRAB, SELL OUT!! im disapointed in you steam. and will spend my money else where."
"The recent update (July 2016) has completely ruined the game and the entire TF2 experience. Please bring back the regular casual mode and shift the competitive match making to a seperate optional section. The game was a 10/10 all day long sans this update. This was the ultimate after work destresser, casual silly fun!  I will no longer play the game until this is corrected and subsequently I will not be making any more in game purchases. Cannot recommend to anyone. Will change to a positive review and a glowing recommendation when causal play returns in all it's glory..."
This is a very good game and the recent updates are bad but I just use community servers it's still good 
my parents view me as one of the most worthless things in my house and all i do is play video games proving their point. play this gme at your own risk
VALVE YOU ♥♥♥♥ED UP FIX TF2
"this is a awsome game if i were to rate it, it will be a 1000000/10"
"best f2p shooter out there, all i got to say about that"
I like how the game is fun.
"Overwatch isnt killing tf2, Valve is.       If you squint hard enough, you can forget that about only 30 people are developing this game."
"Very addicting game, play almost 24/7!"
I LOVE THIS GAME SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH IF U HAVENT GOT IT THEN GET IT U HAVENT LIVED UNTIL U GOT THIS F**KING EPIC GAME (Well u actually have lived BUT WHATEVER)
"Epic and funny, this game's hat based economy, slapsticky violence, and fast pace play never get old. So if you have ever wondered what it might be like to beat someone to death with a fish or instantly restore horrific injuries by way of a sandwich, then PLAY THIS GAME!"
"Fifty thousand people used to play this game, now it's a ghost town.."
Good and funny game you must install this!
"I have played this game for years, this game is one of the most diverse shooters I've ever played. It may take a little dedication to show the game's true side, but it is very well worth it. It has some problems (that may be fixed soon) like how broken pyro's flamethrower is, many exploits on maps, etc. but it is all around well made game.  (Please give mvm some love valve plz)"
A nice game. I recommend this totally!
This is a game that you'll keep coming back to.
10/10 Best war themed hat/dank meme/original joke simulator I've ever played.
I spent actual money on virtual hats
"I've always historically been terrible at shooters of any kind, so why do I love TF2? The answer is very simple. This game is so non-sensical, so seditiously idiotic, and so unreliant on actual gun-play that I CAN be good at this, and still say 'Im terrible at shooters'  Basic gameplay boils down to strategiclly (or mindlessly) killing the opposing team with a selection of weapons that range from: fish, milk, soda, syringe guns, golf clubs, shoes, and stylish (or not so stylish) hats  In fact, this game should just be called Hat Simulator"
"People say there is no way to win this game but they're wrong. The most satisfying thing is when you go a class and you are so good that you're accused of hacking, that's when you win.     Just kidding whoever has the most hats is the winner."
"Very good game, played it for a while. :)"
I have wasted my life
"Well **** you Valve, This good game turned to **** just because you had to add competetive and ruin it for everyone else... TF2 IS NOT ******* CS:GO"
"Very Fun, but last updated ♥♥♥♥ed up the game"
"Fantastic game, highly enjoyable and has high replay ability.   I do have some qualms with Valve as a company not putting as much emphasis on the game as they should, but the game is still amazing regardless of this. I strongly recommend playing this game."
"Addictive game with smooth and balanced game play. Highly recommended, especially as it's free!"
OH YES JUST DOWNLOAD THAT ♥♥♥♥♥ IT'S GREATE!!! :D
Dont have a hat you aint gud 420/20  would hat again
This game is so good...I like very much his update. I like TF2
"Yeah, its a pretty good game."
Best game on steam :D
Press E for MEDIC!
This game doesnt get updated with real content anymore. Also crashes at the most inconvient times. 10/10 game doesnt want you to play it.
"I wouldn't really fully recommend this to any old school gamer, but for free it's one of the best games ever. VALVe have done an amazing job making their games available free to play for all, with premium access to the Orange Box buyers, so now VALVe can bring in lots more players that weren't previously aware of their awesome games. Only problem I find with it is most of the community, and the unseriousness of the gameplay. The hats, the items, they just don't do it for me. TFC was all about teamwork, shooting, and plain seriousness. Whereas with TF2, it's all just joking, cartoon-y, hats, items, trading...You get the point. I like the game, and I still recommend it to everyone, but It's just not for me."
"Now that I have reached 2000 hours on TF2, I suppose I should make a review now. Unfortunately I suck at reviewing stuff and describing things. But yeah this game does have its pros and cons. Here's a few(by the way I suck at finding pros and cons too, so I just put the first things that pop into my mind):  Pros: Mostly balanced (there are a few weapons that , in my opinion, need to be nerfed/buffed.) Easy to learn the basics Exciting (except if its CTF and both teams have a lot sentries guarding there intel, that's just boring) gameplay Many different weapons to choose from, so you can make a loadout that works for you. The characters have interesting personalities and have some funny things to say. MvM is also pretty fun. There are different mods such as VSH(Versus Saxton Hale) and Freak Fortress which are really fun, and chaotic ones like TF2 x10 (for those who never heard of this, its a mod in which the stats of a weapon are multiplied by 10). There's a lot more pros than this. I couldn't think of what else to write.  Cons: Glitches seem to pop up every now and then, especially after an update. Some players of the community are jerks to F2Ps. The economy is a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the moment. Players will sometimes kick you for no apparent reason. The price of keys( remember when keys were worth 2.66 ref? Yeah I do too. Oh, and you will only know what I'm talking about if you've done a good amount of trading.) I'm pretty sure that there's some more cons for TF2, i just can't think of any right now.  Overall pretty decent game."
This is a fun game. Recommend to play it.
"Extremely fun class based FPS, but what are you waiting for?, ITS FREE, go get it already"
"Many people have quitted this glorious game for overwatch, You just don't quit games. The game was and will be worth every second i play it. Valve.....pls make tf2 great again."
If you have not already tried this game your crazy go get it now!
taunt fortress 2
Eh. It's ok
love it. excellent items. variety of game modes. mvm rocks. frequently updated...... if you don't have this. get it.
DON'T UPDATE
"A really good game, what can i say. You have 9 classes, and each has its weaknesses and advantages. Yes, there are some that are better than other classes, but still, everyone has something the others can't give. Many maps, and alot made by the community, so you'll never run out of new maps to explore and play. "
Good game and so munch memory whit very good friend :)  Perfect for play whit friend.But you can rage too :3
"I used to love this game but the last update sucks. Competative is a great idea and im all for that being a game mode but let it be its own thing like mvm was. Casual has turned into competative light or rather, competative with training wheels. Frankly, im not that interested in competative but I love the casual goofy side it used to have. the whole game just feels stressful and tense now and im very dissapointed. I'm hoping the next update will fix this and make it more Casual again, like the name would suggest. #Maketf2GreatAgain"
"Amazing game, great variety in-game store and items, all around epic action. The only problem is getting everyone to work as a team to win. Too many CoD players and people who don't care come on here and play like they are the best of all time. And F2P (Free-to-play) 'racism' is super thick on alot of servers. If you can manage that though, this is worth every penny."
"This game is an amazingly good waste of time; not in a bad way. Once you play this game for a few hours, it just becomes more and more fun. This game absorbs tons of your time, but it is worth it once you get premium. I can not think of a FPS I enjoy more than this game, you have to spend time to enjoy it and know the plot behind it which is not told through gameplay, but it has an extremely large plot behind this cartoon game where the market is almost entirely hats. I highly recommend this game for people who enjoy a fun time with multiple play modes to choose from so you can almost create your own game and play the way you want to."
"Team Fortress 2 is a fun multiplayer class shooter that shows the funny and playful aspect combined with the action based class shooter. It is great, and I think you should get it."
"An excellent game, one of my favorite online games of all time. It's entirely free, except for hats and weapons, BUT! You can get all those weapons by just PLAYING THE GAME! That's what I did, and even now that I have all the weapons, I can still have fun playing. Also, there's updates every few months that fix balance issues, and add a lot of items (mainly hats). Plus, you can make items in the Steam Workshop that can possibly be ADDED TO THE GAME! Incredible, right? Lastly, trading in this game is an immense economy full of rises and drops. Once you get into this trading community, you can make serious profit, and eventually, you can MAKE. MONEY. That's right, you can BUY other Steam games by PLAYING A FREE ONE! Is that not AMAZING? If you aren't downloading this game right this second, I pity what you're missing out on.  Over 2000 hours and still going strong."
A team based FPS game with hats. Not much else to say.
If you dont have Team Fortress 2 you have bin living in a cave this is a great multiplayer first person shooter with different kinds of game modes loads of maps 9 classes a buch of weapons miscs hats all of the good stuff! The thing that makes this game great is that all 9 classes have there strong points and flaws unlike some other games! Get this game its fun great and if you get board of it you will come back in about a week to kill someone with that rocket launcher of yours for the LOLZ!
Great game for a great price!
"Great Game, plenty of ways to get things for FREE xD"
there has never been a day where i wanted to get rid of this game and there never will be
Verry good shooter/class game. !
10/10 would play
It's ok
"************************************************************************************************************************************* VALVE READ ME!!!!!!!!!!! ************************************************************************************************************************************* TF2 used to be such a good game, until this update desteroyed it. I absolutley love this game, it has become a part of my life, but many others are parting from it due to this horrid update. I'm close to joining them! Valve, if you are reading this, heres a strategy to bring back your customers. You have 2 options:  1: Bring back Quickplay (aka pubs) entirley with autobalance, voting and all, and repeal casual mode entirley, making it just like before the update except with competitive mode (which is pretty cool and I have nothing wrong with the comp gamemode)  or  2: Make Competitive a category and have 2 sub catagories: Casual and hardcore (hardcore being current competitive) Then bring back Quickplay entirley. Therefore you can add 2 extra gamemodes while keeping playres happy. The HUD would go like this: Play Multiplayer Play Competitive- Casual or Hardcore Play Co-op  I highly suggest the second one, it's the best of both worlds. Anyways, you should put at least one of these plans in action extremley fast, as your fanbase is shrinking. Mighty TF2 Youtubers such as the great spy Mr. Paladin have already left TF2, so I'm begging all of you at Valve to put in effort and FIX TEAM FORTRESS 2!!!!  Thank you for your time, Valve."
Awesome game. Free and good community!
good though
Install to wait in a screen so that you can play a match. 10/10 Wortst update
Killed a game i loved. If vavle reverts this update back to the old layout i might start playing again when i can actually just chose the map i want to play. Otheriwse you may see me in jump maps from time to time.
"I used to really like this game, and I still think that it's wonderful. But with Valve's new competitive addition to it, the game actually lost it's touch with me. I've played a few of the competitive matches, I like the concept, but once someone leaves you lose any benefit to staying. Heck you're actually encouraged by people to leave. Good Game, but there needs to be a penalty to anyone and everyone who abandons a match. All the other gamemodes they had, casual, mann V machine, and the bot matches are still good in my mind, no problems, and wonderful. If you pick up this game for the competitive though, be aware it's a little depressing, the result of it."
This video here pretty much says why I love TF2.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=261216581   TF:GO? Who says that's a bad thing? Who cares if they already have weapon skins in CS:GO? It's a cool addition to have in TF2.
Only game where you can switch from killing your enemies to dancing with them over the course of 2 seconds
Very good game! :)
I love Gibus Engi
Free and fun. 
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ game
Pretty Terrific Game! 14/10 Would Reccomend.
This is an amzing game idk y they kept it f2p
"The game would do with a couple of fixed, for instance the queing times bieng improved currently it takes 5-10 minutes to find a game, apart from that the game is great"
It is a really good game and i honestly got hooed to it the first time i played it
"Team Fortress 2  Story - I'm not sure if it counts as story, or if this is still around, it's been a while since I played, but it's got this robot defense thing, it's got king of the hill, some capture the briefcase, and achievement servers for you noobs. 10/10  Storyline length - It depends what gamemode you choose. The robot defense thing can last an entire hour or less if you have a lot of engineers. King of the hill shouldn't take too long. Seven minutes(?) Either way, it's fun.  AI - Like the actual players. Some are experts, some are newbies. But, this isn't the game to be calling people noobs. That's for CS:GO. Anyway, AI is cool. 10/10  Experience - It's fun for the first hundred hours. Then you don't feel like playing it. Then you accidentally press play and still enjoy TF2. It's amazing. 10/10  Graphics - It's quite childish, but at the same time it isn't. How does a game just do that? 10/10  Sounds / Voice Acting - Tbh all you ever hear in online is 'MEDIC!' or really loud gunshots, or scouts that are like full health but still take med packs. Or 'JAARATE!'. Good sounds though. I guess. 9/10  Controls - Just like CS:S 10/10  Overall - 10/10  Quite fun, I like this game. There isn't much to say about this game, as I already said everything there is to say up there. Besides, it's free, so just get it. It also adds ♥♥♥♥ to Garry's Mod."
This game is awesome because of trading (i prefer trading rather than playing but playing is interesting too) its so good to just go and trade and make profit but there is a minus that the keys price is tf2 is too high i think valve need to create new keys or something i dont know how to fix the price of keys i recomend valve to try to play tf2 trading itself and see problems with it but i would recomend this game because its like trading game and fps game put in one game last thing i almost forgot that they should make paint drops for f2p more often because its the only tradable drop for f2p so yea
"Great game! Aside from the constant need to buy stuff, one of my favorite games!"
"I'll be honest...At first I refused to play this game after hearing Valve is mainly interested in 'making more multi-player games over Half Life 3'. I got a cosmetic item from Wolfenstien on my sister's account (I didnt have my own at the time) and decided i'll have a go for a laugh. I didnt mean to get addicted but I did! Sure, you very occasionally bump into the unfriendly players but there's also the ones you can enjoy playing by your side--or as enemy. haha! Let's not forget the hilarious personality of each character you can play as with their unique class! I would recommend this game to anyone who loves first person shooter games!! Warning: very addictive! :D"
theres a lot more to this game than hats.
"Team Fortress years ago appeared as a modification for the first Half -Life , and had gained great popularity . But since then a lot of time has passed and how it happens , things change . Valve took this pun in finery and built on its foundations standalone game offered as part of the Orange Box. And I think it will come as no surprise when I say that this is an extremely good achievement ."
One of the FPS you will ever play...
"I Love this game because,there always haves fun and i recommend this game!"
Really good game would get very expensive
One of the best games i have ever played a definite buy plus its completely free.The only thing is there are some things you have to pay for later in the game.9.7/10
Tf2 is a great game where people come and play it has a quite friendly community and is an okay game for new comers i would really recommend you pick it up from your local gamestop or eb-games no im just kidding steam is life but anyways its a great game and you should really download it and have fun!!
I love This Game
The update is crashing my tf2. cant join any valve servers. pls fix
"The Meet your Match update is the WORST update because it took away staying on a casual server. Also, you add being able to hear and respond to enemy players in casual and competitive. But all and all, I made a lot of friends, always have fun play on cool servers, and had amazing laughs on Team Fortress 2!!!  Meet your Match Update - 4/10 All of Team Fortress 2 - 100/10"
i recomend this game beacuse me and my siblings had lots of fun playing it and  i deffiently recommend this game to have fun with your siblings and family ;)
"not a big fan of First Person Shooters but Team Fortress 2 is an exception, fun! fast-paced and with relatively low wait times for match's are amongst the highlights of this game and a very steady and strong set of gameplay mechanics and plus it's free to play!"
"This is by far my favorite game. At first it might be a tiny bit hard to get used to, and in my experience it was hard to get used to the new combat and community at first, but after I learned about the economy of the game, the trading community, the servers and game modes, the different plays styles and more, I instantly knew this game would be my favorite. I suggest this game 100% as I don't regret any of the money or time I spent on this game. While playing this game I have made so many friends and memories, and I have laughed so many times. Even when I do spend money to open the crates in game it makes me happy to know I am supporting the developers."
"Great game, lots of fun game modes."
All round fun game to play. 9/10
"Well, as you can see from my hours (This isn't my only account) that I've put a significant amount of my life into this game, and I'd say it's worth every penny if it wasn't free haha.   I've made about $10,000 (USD) so far from merely trading (I've cashed out a bit, lost a bit, etc) This took time and patience, but if you're looking to get into an amazing game, TF2 is the one for you.   All the classes have their own sense of humor, and bring something unique to the table. This game, as the title states is a TEAM game, that requires active team work and skill to do well and get the job done. It introduces several game modes including capture the flag, king of the hill (personal favorite), payload, and many more. This game is also extremely balanced, no microtransactions and best of all, isn't p2w. Best of all, all classes are customizable with different hats, miscs, and a huge variety of weapons to choose from for the class you prefer. Whether you are a pro gamer, or a noobie, you'll get the hang of the game easily, isn't a hard game to get into right away at all. Very active player base, the games been out for so many years, and that's why you see it as one of the best PC games of all time.   To sum it up, you have nothing to lose from getting this game because it's 100% free! Why am I even writing a review? Go have fun!"
Its time to stop.
"It's a great game, it has great weapons, and it's FREE! Why wouldn't you like this?"
"This game has been fun over the last couple years. I recommend playing this game. There is different game modes like payload race, ctf, and control points. During holidays Valve changes the game to that holiday. There is servers that have other gamemodes like Saxton Hale, Deathrun, SlenderFortress, Jailbreak, etc. Overall this game was pretty good for a free to play game."
"The Occams Razor of FPS's, This is dead. But not in the sense of not picking this up! They just... Need to revert back to the old UI, Nerf the ♥♥♥♥ out of pyro,and you're done!"
"Dayum, best f2p ever! the controls are natural, smooth and dynamic, also, it is for everybody to play, there is no hostility in the game, the point of TF2 is to have fun, and only to have fun, can't match this to any other f2p out there to this date."
"#BringBackPubs  I have played this game for hours, as you can see and I have stopped playing about a year ago. Now I am playing again and here is why:  If you begin to play this game you become part of the community. And its not as simple as you might think. At first you play the game how it was intended to be played. But then at some point you find this Heavy-Bear who just sits there with his sandvich. You tell him to 'Lets Go' and he just shakes his head and yells 'NIET!'. This is where the game introduced me to the other side of it. The silly side, so to say. And I cant say that I am disapointed. Infact it brought me even more fun to the game.  As Jerma once said: We wouldnt be playing if things like that wouldnt happen in our game.  Like a spy trying to kill a sniper and it continuing for a minute. Suddenly the sniper crouches and so does the spy and they keep calling each other spies. A Pyro comes close, looks at them and just heads to the enemy to keep playing the way he wants to play at that moment. And maybe he comes back after respawn just to join them on the spy parade.  TF2 is a game for everyone. If you want to just have fun with silly stuff or play the game as it was intended. If you have not tried out this game, then do so right now. Its free.  Come and join the Hoovy-Club!"
"I have not played this game nearly as long as everyone else (at the time of this review), but I feel I still have some insight of value for anyone considering picking it up.  One of the biggest appeals I can see with this game (other than the fact that it's free) is that there is a tremendously high skill cap. There is always something new for you to learn, be it rocket jumping, good sentry placement, or just knowing where all the healthkits are. Because of this, there's tons of fun and new experiences to be had. Each day I feel I get a little bit better, I know the maps more, I know what to counter tricky opponents like dead ringers and huntsmans, or I get my ♥♥♥ handed to me by people who've put thousands of hours into the game.  There are 9 classes, each of them unique in their playstyle and the weapons they can wield. From the slow moving minigun wielding Heavy to the lightning fast scout, there's a playstyle for everyone. Also, Valve has done a fantastic job of balancing the game. Every class and weapon has advantages and disadvantages, but not too much that they can't get around their 'Counters' With a bit of skill and intuition. Each class has a primary, a secondary, and a melee weapon. There's your standard shotguns, flamethrowers and rocket launchers but also some wierd ones like lasers, frying pans... milk?  So who would I not recomend this amazing game to?  People who enjoy story driven games: Believe it or not, TF2 does have a story, but you have to go out of your way to find it (in the comics or other places) and I feel it serves more to explain and give a reason for how crazy things got ingame than to be an actual story.  People who play games for the atmosphere: TF2 has some excellent music and scenery, that's for sure. Muted colours with industrial complexes resembling factories and barns of the 1950's and fitting perfectly with the sombre but hopeful music driven by the military beat of snare drums makes for a great atmosphere... Until a soldier falls out of the sky and hits you on the head with a shovel who is then killed instantly by a spy who decloaks and pops out of nowhere, only to get covered in ♥♥♥♥ and shot to death by an obscene sniper who gets obliterated by a demoman who gets shot by a guy who gets trickstabbed by another who gets burned to death by another who walks into a sentry nest and gets shot to death... Basically, the game can be atmospheric, but you won't have any time to enjoy it.  People who expect to hop in and do well instantly: This game has a lot of fancy physics, mecahnics, playstyles, and weapons to learn, on top of the need for general skills like good reflexes and accuracy. Put simply, you will probably be getting a lot more deaths than kills at first. As long as you are willing to learn and keep playing, within a couple of sessions you should be reasonably skilled.  Hackers: The community is extremely good at finding and rooting out hackers. I've seen people call the whistle on their aimbotting teammates even if said hacker was winning the game. Often people will go into spectator mode if they see something fishy and call a vote to kick the player. Regardless, the more hardcore TF2 players seem willing to do anything to keep the game hacker free (maybe because of good intentions, maybe because they don't want competition :P).  And finally, Lone Wolves/Nodeath-ers: This is a team game. So much so that it's in the name. Being a team player is essential to getting the most out of TF2, as well as the key to winning most of your games. Whether it's repairing other engie's dispensers, warning your teammates of where the spies are, or simply not taking the healthpacks if someone else needs it more, you are helping your team win far more than just hiding in a corner of the map with a stickybomb trap or phlogistinator. And don't get me wrong, while kills are important, it's necessary to balance out the kills with the main objectives. And while you should try not to get killed, there's no need to go overboard. Chances are that if you're new to the game, you won't know where the healthpacks are. If there aren't any near you, it's often just quicker to see if you can take someone down with you and respawn rather than backtracking all the way to your base and healing.  In conclusion, Team Fortress 2 is a fantastic game that I am proud to call myself a player of."
"First Game I Ever play On Steam, fun to play, meet alot of good poeple, and my childhood game.  give it a 9.5/10"
"After the latest update, Valve ruinedthe game, they took out quick play (the breadand butter of tf2) and added casual mode, which doesnt have autobalance making for seriously unbalanced games, and it takes a long time to just get into a game."
Lovely game 10/10 would play again
So much fun for a price of nothing.
Cool game..... just play it...
terribad game 0/10 everyone is a scrub would not spend any time on it
Team Fortress 2 is very nice free game. I recommended it to all gamers and ages. Thanks Valve so much.
"Originally, I downloaded this game simply for content in Garry's Mod, thinking I would never take interest in it and play it. I made a mistake. I started playing it in early September, and I'm very glad I did. Everything about it is so loveable. The less realistic, stylized art style, the map design, the gamemodes, the variety of the classes, (the satisfaction when you kill a really good player), weapons, hats and outfits, and the constant stream of community made items! In my opinion, it is far better than other FPS games on the market, and it's free! Without a doubt, I recommend this game to anyone who wants exactly what Team Fortress 2 has to offer, or someone who simply wants a game to be addicted to!"
one of the most addicting free games out there..... also the trading is ♥♥♥♥ing awsome!
They call it ''Quick Play'' while you still have to wait 1 hour to get into a match. Also the competitive pass is more than any other valve game. Thanks valve
With over 700+ hours on this game I think I have the right to say it's one of the greatest games ever.
ABSOLUTE BEST GAME EVER
i love these game i have spint over 30$ on these game lol :)
Play game. Get weapons. Remember about hats. Craft metal. Buy hat. Sell hat for more. Get profit. Get key. Unbox. Get unusual. Get scammed. Cry. Repeat procedure.
"One of the best free to plays i ever installed. I found Neat items in this game and saw hats that should be in the game. The best class i use the most is Engineer. All of my friends that dont have steam should and have this game. 19/10 stars of this game my friends should play. There should be a update for the words on this, Just make it like it actully says the real nick, other than Like (Example Next) LcL Is LcLpic. It more should be like Lol Is Lolpic. That should be the update, I wasnt being mean, I was just asking for the next update. Thanks for understanding Valve."
"great fun game, good fun to play with friends...you will indefinately need a mouse i would reccomend this for people who are looking for a game to play with friends. if your looking for the real steam experience your looking at it. only one real nit pick, guess it would be the file size, but your looking at a good game, also the maps take a long time to load (dont hate, my internet not that good)  this is a great game"
Spys are red. Spys are blue. That spy is a spy. So are you.
Play it... its free :D
"It's almost hard to review this game. Most of what I say has been said many times before. This is an amazing game. Despite any glitches or bugs this game has, it is always fun. It has an incredibly unique multiplayer fps experience that is absolutely unrivaled. It doesn't even really compare to CoD, Battlefield, or Counter Strike. Valve never lets players down with new content and is always changing any sort of metagame or unused aspect. This is the shortest way I can describe how great this game is, and for free it is almost impossible to not at least try it. Give it a go if you haven't. It might not be for everyone, but you won't know unless you try."
This game is fun to play with a great community to help you out if you need help and you meet great people inside the game
i saw a spy stab a spy who just stabbed a spy who was going to stab a spy. 10/10
"Team Fortress 2 is about a multiplayer only game that includes 9 different classes to battle on a wide variety of modes, some including: Payload, Capture the Flag, and King of The Hill.   This game is for people who definately loves destruction and guns, as well as multiplayer/cooperative purposes. This game is good in all, including but not limited to :  -The graphics (are good, and cartoonish) -The guns. You can unlock special weapons and special effects for 'fancy killing' (stock is usually good) -The classes -MvM (Man versus Machine co-op)  There are also some cons to this game, which will most likely lead to lots of fustration, death (in-game), and rage. The community isn't consistant of the 'almost perfect player(s)', and will make the game almost unbearable to be listening to a kid with a scratchy bluetooth, or something like that (also idiotic chat binds in game). Although, you can just leave the server or just kick them.  Overall, this game has nice gun/gameplay and cooperation aspects of it, which makes it very nice. The community can be unbearable to be with, which is annoying after a while. If I could rate this, I would give it an 8.4/10."
"This game is very entertaining,I luve how people rage in this game sometime ^^"
"We all know what TF2 is all about - hats, skills and FUN!"
"Love the game. Can't get enough of it. My process of love went like this: Love for weapons Love for 2Fort Love for Stranges Love for crates and keys Love for Hats Want for unusual Overall, if working for this was my job, i'd take it in a heartbeat.  Valve, GG. "
great gmae good times but watch out for sharks
"Its big, its loud, its diverse, it requires skill, involves guns, explosions, fire, rockets...AND ♥♥♥♥...what more could an fps gamer want?"
An excellent and fast-paced shooter from the past. A must have for everyone.
Team Fortress 2 – it gets the aggression out. No yoga! And you can't score points in yoga anyway. Neither the hats.
"Used to be a simple hat simulator and teaches basics of how to trade items in 'steam universe'. Nowadays became skin simulator as well due to ppl that like skins(no, skins to show others and 'be cool' instead of using skin mods). Beside all of that, I met a lot of nice ppl, friends and fu*king dongers... Variations of stuff u could try there is boundless, plus it's free."
"Best game, A lot of friends and fun times were given while playing this game."
I love this game!!! It's a great shooter for anyone who is a fan of Half-Life and other games created by Valve!
I absolutely love it :D.
"Team Fortress 2 is, at heart, a gloriously simple game that's been created with style, panache and an undeniable love of gaming. It's the kind of game that you want to show to people who don't play games so that they understand and then either get involved or go away."
"If 'Free to Play' scares you away from this titile: don't let it. It is a great game! There is no need to pay anything, as all items are given though 'drops', the more you play, the more stuff you get, Premium Player or not.   Speaking of 'Premium Player'. you become one by spending ANY amount of money in the game, even under $1, and you will always be a Premium Player, no subscriptions. This basically lets you have more items, and sometimes get hats and rare (but only cosmetic) items through the drops.  Players are not hindered by being Free to Play, or by not playing a lot. The default guns given are balanced, and unlocked guns provide benefits in some areas, but have negatives in others (ex. a larger clip, but no random critical hits).  All in all, the only thing that will make you like or hate the game is the gameplay, not the pricetag. If you like FPS games, you will love it, if not, still give it a try, you could have fun, and not need to worry about being locked behind a paywal. "
GOOD GAME LIKE TO PLAY IT TRY IT OUT YOU WONT BE DISAPPONTED
""
"Best game on steam, easy."
the newest update has disgraced tf2 and is a big '♥♥♥♥ you' to tf2 players
its a game
"Hell yeah i recommend this game!, anyone that plays it will be instantly addicted!"
"Best game I have played in a long time, and honestly worth a small investment"
"The best online action game EVAR!!! A game where there is a sea of ​​fun, blood, and most importantly team spirit. No CoD is not able to convey these feelings. I played TF2, playing and will play a very long time."
this is the best 'free to play ' game you will fined on steam.it is funny game that make you play over and over and over with non-stop.10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10
"awesome, well balanced classes. Completely not a pay 2 win f2p game. Great economy"
sometimes i like to stick my nipples in hydrogen chloride
"10000000/10000000  This game is sooooo good! its amazing, funny, hilarious, and kinda addicting. Specially funny if you have friends who play MvM, its like a co-op mode were you can earn stuff!  Get it, its free, but its tottally worth getting the premium update!"
I was a looking for a decent multiplayer FPS game when I stumbled upon this. I’ve seen this title before but didn’t think much of it until I checked some reviews and gameplay videos. Now I’m hooked! 5 Stars!
the ♥♥♥♥
Game was very fun however new update has removed key features such as   *Puplic Servers*  *Vote system*  And now there are the following problems  *Long wait times for casual*  I can understand why they made you pay for competive pass *$10* however this update has made me want stop playing until i finish
I love burning people. Good game.
awesome game ... must play!
I used to love tf2 a lot but after the matchmaking update i no longer can You see at the time of writing this review i am waiting for a casual game to load I have been waiting for 30 minutes no- oh wait it JUST found a game I hate the new layout and system in general please bring the old one back
Gg wp 10/10 like skyrim with hats would play again
"TF2 is an exciting fun game with very good graphics, with nine distinct classes, scout (the fastest), soldier (the rocketman), pyro (the pyromaniac), demoman (the demolitonist), heavy (the heavyweaponsguy), engineer (the techincal defenseive builder), sniper (the hitman), medic (the healer), and spy (the invisible back-stabbing ninja). All of these classes balance out with each other, where one class is no more superior and lesser than another. Overall TF2 is a fun exciting game with 9 balanced out distinct classes, where world-wide players team up together, on two teams, (attack and defense), on different map gamemodes, to win against the other team. Their are also many cosmetics to choose from to make any class of your's look snazzy, fancy, hip, etc. Many different guns to try out for each class. I reccomend this game to FPS players, like COD, BF3, BF4, players, etc. who want to play something different for a change. Their also many taunts, like the newest one, THE CONGA!!!, also many killing taunts that u can enable to kill enemies. Their's one taunt you can use called the Kamikaze, where as a soldier, you can run-up to an enemy or a group and taunt, blowup killing you and possibly, the enemies around you. I definitely reccomend this game to people who like shooting, fast-paced, good graphics games!!!"
I love TF2. It's a wonderful pastime and I would definitely reccomend it to all of my friends due to the amount of fun I have during my experiences with it.
very good not what all people think
i luv this game so much i have 259 hours on it 
I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! (♥♥♥♥ anyone who doesn't)
"I hate this community There are good things and bad things about the community of this game but the bad things just overwelm the good things. -So many people thirsty to trade -Trying hard -Insulting your playstyle or copying it -Not knowing the basics of every class (If I am on fre and there is a friendly pyro in front of me, I expect him to either put out the fire with an airblast or a manmelter) -Trading hats for insane prices (either too low or too high) (I don't care if it's level 35 and you think that the number is special, trade me for the actual price) -Show offs (Look at my unusual and strange australium killstreak botkiller guys!)  But Hell, I still find myself playing this game a lot more than most other f2p games.  Meh 11/10"
10/10 Great for PC gamers all around!
"The reason of this opinion is that valve keep adding more hats and more and more... Also random criticals are annoying thing. I understand 1 critical in a row, even 2, but 3 it's way too much. I really do not recommend this game. It is a good game, only when you don't care about hats, but only gameplay."
Money Maker!$$
good game! it just need some more hats
"First Person Online Shooter with cartoony graphics, massive community, lots of player customization and endless hours of fun. This review is entirely for people who live under rocks."
+It's Free-to-play +Lots of weapons +Easy tutorial for beginners +So much cosmetics +Good gamemodes +Community updates and server +Item drop system  -Lot of cosmetics are very expensive -A small selection of weapons -Some bugs
"You might know Team Fortress 2 as 'Hat Fortress 2' or stuff like that,if we ignore the hats and talk about gameplay: It's amazing and totally awesome. i think it's the best Free to Play you can ever find. it's not Pay to Win, it's all about team work. It's addicting and truly a brilliant game.  but of cource we can't make a review about Team Fortress 2 without mentioning the hats of cource, well- it makes the game even more beautiful. Have fun playin' it maggots! "
Very Nice Game
Really fun game. I've played it more than any other game I payed for in my steam library. 10/10
"Free, fun, and did I mention free? This game only leaves me with two questions: 'Why aren't you downloading this NOW!?' and WHERE CAN I GET THIS SOUNDTRACK!?!?"
"Do you like very serious games? do you like games that have dramatic stories, in-depth gameplay, and touching scenes? WELL THIS GAME IS NOT FOR YOU! This game is not your standard FPS game, this game has so much humor in it, you can't take it seriously. 'How do I know that this game isn't some generic FPS game and you're just talking bs?' watch meet the pyro and meet the spy....just..ju.just watch. To conclude this review, there are many different things you can do in it, you can play on custom maps, like mario_kart_v20, randomizer maps, you can purchase hats and costumes to make your character look like a baddas fighting machine, or a strange person in a wierd outfit that makes you cry 'I NEED AN ADULT!' i highly suggest this game to anybody who is into whacky and silly stuff, if you find this game to be interesting, i ma going to give you a little advice. remember to spy-check! ;)"
"OK, so recently Valve updated this game with a competitive matchmaking. Great comeback to this used to be an awesome game? Nope. This game mode (comp matchmaking) is broken to the point of frustration. And it is all because of leavers. You can be winning whole match and few seconds before the end someone will abandon, and all your time land in a garbage bin. No competitive points will be granted. So many other bad decisions have been made with this update. At this point just do not bother. If you are into competitive matchmaking, it is not worth your time."
wasted my life  was good
"As we all know Team Fortress 2 does not require any special review. Great game, but i am unable to play due to my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet"
an awesome game .... yeah but JUST GIVE ME L4D2
Thos game so good but many thailand kid in this game 
Tippity top notch game
"I play this game on a daily basis, it's great and fun and entertaining. It's hard to grasp the trading and crafting and other stuff when you're just a beginner at this, but the point of this game is pretty simple; just kill the enemy. There's different game types, Payload, Control Points, just to name a few. It's action-packed and and great fun with friends. I highly recommend it."
I connot think of a reason NOT t get this game as it is completly free and you can only pay $ to speed up unlocks. Even on old or lower end computers this game runs very smoothly so dont worry. Why dont you already have this game?!
lol this game sucks
UI blows devs rarely touch game
"Mate, Team Fortress 2 for me is the most Awesome game in the Steam.... Really man i play like 800 hours i think. is very cool mate. Play but Play like a MANN"
Launch game and just play
"This game is just tons of fun, I like both the econimic side and the play side of this game."
"Live in New Zealand  After update keep getting into other region  Such as  Europe, South Africa, Hong Kong and more  I cant play game anymore  Well done valve  "
"Worst 'update' ever. If you haven't played TF2 yet, then definitely don't get it now. Absolute rubbish..."
"In my opinion this is the most friendly, awesome FPS ever. I've never seen a game where everybody just taunts and high fives eachother before they fight eachother."
Great job Valve. You went full ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and turned the game into piece of ♥♥♥♥ with just one update. Totally unplayable now.
"This game has changed and not for the better. Once balanced items have become OP to the point of dominant chocie, each update adds something new for Valve to suck more money out of it with, and the game is slowly dying. I used to LOVE this game, it was doing so good, but then the bad updates began and now I could never think of going back. With every weapon I love nerfed to useless, every weapon that was already good but not too powerful buffed to insane levels, and their new focus on competetive modes and going away fromt eh casual approach of the game, I'm glad to say I'm never coming back."
Most of the updates that valve made were acceptable but this time it has just gone way too far. Now the only place were a tiny bit of Gaben's magic still exists are the almost always empty community servers which is depressing. I wonder if muselks servers still work after this horrible update
VALVE never listen to this community
"I wish I could have paid for this game, thats how good it is"
"Download this game right now! It's the best f2p game i ever played! Total fun,nice community,editable characters (hats,weapons,miscs) many servers for everyone and maaaany maps/gamemodes. i suggest you also play MvM,awesome zombiewave-like gamemode but with ROBOTS and it's nearly bugless.All in all,it's a totally awesome game. 10/10"
Old but still gold.
One of the best games on Steam! But Valve please add pubs back!
" http://steamcharts.com/app/440#6m  ~ Chart that track number of players  Latest Update it absolute ♥♥♥♥. Have to manually disconnect from server what the actual f''' Can not select both valve and community Vote system disabled, go f''' yourself Laggy as my grandmothers a'' Servers seem to be down 24/7, what is this pokemon go Did the devs forget the K.I.S.S method??? Takes forever to get matchup, one would think this is man vs machine que.  Update look like a copy of overwatch, Dear devs get a clue when you start doing something after another game has released it to the public before you, it will be see as copyied and underhanded even if you started a beta for the software first. I mean look at firefox. They developed the chrome UI but, since google used it first everyone thinks they are trying to be more like chrome and has left them for chrome. I really don't want to completely abandon TF2 for overwatch, but at this rate I think I will."
"That was great game before the 'Meet your Match' update. Now in-game experience is 100% frustration.   Quickplay mode is replaced by something they call 'Casual'. In 'Casual' mode team balance is 100% random and no any rebalance options provided. Matchmaking queue was developed by drunk monkeys. So be ready to play on server in opposite point of planet or wait for joining game 30+ mins. And yes, you cannot join your friend without re-queueing.  Old quickplay mode was not perfect, but at least working and playable. Now if you want play game - you must eat 'casual' ♥♥♥♥. Beacuse ♥♥♥♥ you, that's why.  By some strange reason I can't connect to any server located in Stockholm - looks like network problem on server side. But Steam Support just refused to help me.   So game probably is dead. I hope to be mistaken"
"Team Fortress 2 is in my opinion the best FPS game I've ever played. Here's why. It has 9 classes to choose from (Heavy, Medic, Sniper, ect.), lots of gamemodes (Capture the Flag, Control Points, ect.), humorous voicelines for each of the classes, lots of weapons that you can find at random, and of course, hats to customize your characters. Oh, and did I mention it's free? I highly recommend this to anyone who likes FPS games."
"It all started as an innocent Free to Play game. Then there were hats with particle effects.   Goodbye, wallet.       Also please require boot camp before mann up."
I have given my life to this game. Send help. SEND HELP.
"Great game tons of skill levels, and even though this game is pretty old it kicks ♥♥♥..."
im this game ima give a 6 out of 10 for being a good game i love the deathrun an jailbreak but is fun
Send. Help. This game gets you to play it. A lot. And I mean a lot.
"The most team-friendly hat simulator of all time, hat/10 would not hat."
&gt;be about 10 me or some ♥♥♥♥ &gt;the amazement struck me &gt;tf2 is free ♥♥♥♥ers &gt;instantly download the game &gt;go onto idle server &gt;find first hat &gt;ghastly gibus &gt;paint is yellow for some ♥♥♥♥ &gt;play the game day after day &gt;present day &gt;my backpack is worth 1000 ref or some ♥♥♥♥♥  10/10 get me out of here please
"Team Fortress 2 used so be somewhat fun to play, ever since Meet your Match was realeased it all sank to the all time low. Now i know for a fact theres a million of these 'reviews' already, but something needs to be done.   Not 1 minute before writing this, i was in a lobby with not 1, not 2, but 4 'Hackers'  The fact that meeting a cheater before was seemingly once a year before meet your match came out means the valve ♥♥♥♥ed up big time.  Save yourself the trouble and either wait for everything to be fixed, or throw this game into oblivion because it is quite literally unplayable."
its most definately a game
"One of my most played games on Steam, Team Fortress 2 is another VALVe shooter that balances it's gameplay with it's humor. While I haven't played TF2 much recently due to recent updates not being VALVe quality (*cough* Meet Your Match *cough*), I can still hold a big place for this game in my heart.  Team Fortress 2 deserves a solid 8/10 for still being able to hold up after so many years, and allowing me to laugh as many times as I have with these wonderful characters."
"Very good game, it has it's own unique style and graphics. Love it."
not worth the money
Best Team based hat simulator there is
A step-up from Barbie &amp; Ken's Dress-up mansion!
"Amazing game with teamwork, strategy, and a wonderful community."
"This game excells in being a great classic red VS blue game, with all of its customization and new features being released (which i love about games), it gives you a variety of playstyles from being a spy relying on your cloak, or a spy who relies on his disguise and backstabs. The main feature of this game is basically a TDM or Capture the flag style game, or even holiday events where red and blue will sometimes gang up to kill a boss. I don't actually have much to say about this game other than that it is a really good game that takes 2 teams fighting, to a whole new style of gaming. Overall i would rate this game a 9/10."
Really good game multiplayer is loadss of Fun
This is the best game ever i love it not only the battles but the TRADING it's so AWESOME!
One of the finest Massively MultiPlayer games played by me.
"Edit: They are actually working on it. but unless they bring back pubs, i would not recommend it yet.  The 'Meet your match' update or as i would call it 'You need to wait 1 hour to play a valve server or just play an annoying community server' Update killed tf2 in my opinion. Here's why:  -You have to wait for 30 minutes before you can join a valve server -After two to three rounds the server will restart to create another match -You are forced to find a good community server -You need to pay to play competitive -Official Pub Servers are changed to Matchmaking servers   Pls valve, make tf2 great again #tf2isdying"
It's a great game. But the only way to be good at it is if you spend a lot of money on hats with neat effects because only rich people are allowed to have skill. Oh and all your weapons have to be professional killstreaks and stranges but other than that the game's free to play but if you don't waste all your money on it you're obviously trash.  This is a sarcastic review but seriously. Why are you reading tf2 reviews?
The game has lots of servers and players every day and night doesnt matter what server u will have fun unless there are some jerks on the server. then just join a different one and problem solved
Tf2 is a fast paced game with a crtoony look and will make you lagh so much on how stupide the custom made gamemodes are. But if you want to get serious you can buy hats and wepons to look good and get a head of the game. Finally if dont want to pay at all just keep playing and youll find tons of items whe you die.
This game is awesome and rocks
"This game, so fun, and free "
"I would recomend this game to anyone I know. And I have. I have spent many, many hours of fun playing it."
Only Problem is kid ragers.
Literally perfect.
America's #1 war-themed hat simulator.
Original joke about hats
I love this game so much it is the best ever if only i could put it in my bumhole then i would
"TF2 is easily the most fun anyone can have with hats. Not only can you blow people up as you speed through the air using the recoil of a rocket launcher, you can also do it while looking fashionable!  It isn't just a hat simulator though, it is a coat simulator, a boot simulator... All jokes aside, TF2 is the most fun game I've ever played, mainly because the sheer randomness of the game, the variety of maps, and the many community made mods means that every single hour you play is totally different. Strongly recommend, and hey, it's free!"
Very Realistic Hat Simulator 2009 (Beta Test on 2006)
One of the best games on steam. Steam wouldn't be the same without Team Fortress 2.
Who doesnt love the personalities
"Team Fortress 2 is a very well balanced game it have things for everyone with difference play style, sick of shooting people your self build a sentry and start camping, tired of shooting and sick of sentries be a spy and baclstab people and sap those sentry, tired of killing master the arts healing as the medic and support your team today. Reasons this game can last that long is because of it's massive community and valve's caring toward this community listening to ideas, the End of the Line update is one of the great examples. There is no pay to win in this game the other weapons is not a direct upgrade to the origin wepons, every weapon have it's positive and negatives."
"I think that the new update has ruined the game. While I'm happy that there is a competitive gamemode, the penalty for leaving a game is ruining the casual mode, and its really sad that now you have to choose at least 2 gamemodes when you start searching for a pub game, and you can not choose maps either. I hope that tha current state of the game is just temporary."
"thus twas thy devine game, thus recommended by thy"
The best game i have ever played
This game has just became a watered down version of CS:GO.It used to be very fun and addictive but now all you is people grinding the casual mode I used to play this game alot on my other account but now it just sucks.Here's a tip just play on the community servers
TF2 is now trash.
Amazing game. Whoever doesn't play this should.
"I really can recommend this game to many other players out there. I rellay love this game and I nearly play it everyday. I just love the game's cartoony style and all the nice 'lil goodies like free update, not like you have to pay 20 bucks for mann vs machine mode, its free. I bought TF2 in the orangebox when it wasnt free to play, however, there are also many COD kids now and, its just funny to hear them rage because TF2 is much much harder to play. Its harder to play because of the fact, that the players have to complete a objective while fighting in team against each other."
We need pubs back! Get rid of 'Casual Mode'!  PUB's FEATURES:  - Play for as long as you want - Quickly join a game - Choose the mode and the map - Greatest TF2 experience possible
I don't really have to say anything but this game. It robbed me of many hours out of my life.  SCREW YOU VALVE
"Probably one of the best games in Steam anyone who likes First Person Shooter i would Recommend you to play this amazing game, This game has alot of fun things to do x) Trading / MatchMaking / MvM and Many more! Used to play this game when it cost money but i got banned for some reason i cannot be asked to say.. But i really recommend you to play this game its free :D"
"REALY NO FOR THIS GAME , AFTER UPDATE I CANT PLAY A GAME BECAUSE SO LONG TO FIND AND SEARCHING..ITS NOT LIKE BEFORE , FOR NOW I WANT DELETE THIS GAME FROM MY STEAM , IF VALVE HAVE ANY IMPROVEMENT FOR THIS GAME LIKE BEFORE , I WILL PLAY AGAIN, SO VALVE PLS CMON DO SOMEHING"
"Screw this new update, it completely changed the way the game worked, and now I will probably not play this game until it is fixed"
"Welcome to Team Fortress Meet your Match update. After nine years in development (and nine years after the game relase), hopefully it will have been worth the wait. Thanks, and  have fun!  burn in hell."
"Meet your match update has opened the floodgates to hackers and destroyed the casual gameplay that we loved and replaced it with garbage. Go home guys, it's over  EDIT: Hackers are fixed, still don't like the matchmaking, play it if you dont mind the matchmaking but I am leaving this bad review so Valve understands that it is an unwelcome system"
"Great game (not in its current state) that has a bit of a lerning curve for some newer players. and hats. I do recommend this game, but i cannot bring myself to push the yes button at the current time."
9 euro for meet your match ? really?
TF2 was great until ♥♥♥♥ happens.
"As one of my most played games of all time, Team Fortress 2 is an incredidibly original and fun FPS. It not traditional, in a way. But I can honestly say no other game has come as close as being as fun as TF2. I mean, you know when a game is good when it has it's own economy.   Anyway, play TF2. It's free, it's fun, and it doesn't pull too much out of your pockets like other 'Free to Play Games'."
great (YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY) 1000/10
Really fun you get alot free from it it auto gives items.
Awesome game recommend so much
NO MORE PUBS WTFFFFFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"This game was my favorite game on steam, I played it all the time. But this recent update just killed it... now you need to wait forever just to find a normal server, and as soon as a round is over the server closes, and everyone leaves. Now you have to wait a long time to find another server. yay! (sarcasm) I hope this game goes back to the way it used be. Please valve, make it good again... But Heavy vs Pyro is a cool idea. I do not think I will be playing this game as much anymore... bye TF2 :(  RIP TF2"
Dont give a ♥♥♥♥ about casual  Meet your match is ♥♥♥♥ buggy and horrible. No optimization. changing weapons that didnt need to be changed. Lack of communication.
Team Fortress 2 is awesome. ^_^ Fast-paced and action-pack!!!! :D
The game is so good !!!
"TF2 is a great game, and there are so many reasons for this. After being around for 9 years it has been picked up and put down my many people and is still noticed as a fantastic game by people like youtubers and gaming news website writer dudes.  First of all, and the most important in my opinion, the community. Without the community there would be no game and no fun (also no updates for the past few years). The community is not cancerous and corrupted like in games like CS, I think TF2's community is not like CS:GO's because it is a casual game whereas CS:GO is very competetive. The community makes fantastic contribuitons to the community hub page on steam all the time, screeshots, sketches/paintings, videos and loads of NISLT videos. The only problem I have is there is no clear place for people to go to be and feel a part of the community. I am not sure of the solution to my issue, but I have always enjoyed games with big hubs with a friendly environment. I realize a big hub would not fit with TF2 unless it would sort of be the menu, it is just a small idea and all because I enjoyed games like Lego Universe and Destiny in the past.  Moving on to the gameplay, the game can be played at your own pace, you can set the pace buy choosing different gamemodes, different maps, different classes, and different load outs. From the 9 classes to be played there is something for anyone to play, enjoy and be good at. Most people realize that maining a class and only playing that as your main combat is not a fantastic idea and you should really just play a class depending on what is happening in the game. Combat is fun, the exchanges are always unpredictable and exciting. TF is very balanced, this is a reason Valve doesn't really add any weapons, this is also due to laziness and lack of ideas (I got non either).  The maps are by far the most interesting thing in the game to me, I love how the mappers can combine beauty and aesthetic with the balance the map requires for a fun and fair game. I also like the variety of looks for example Suijin, a very recent and very hyped map is like no other, this is because of its art style and unique props. Maps can also be made quite easily if you are a good learner and can tolerate a computer being a ♥♥♥♥. Lots of big trade servers and now getting their own maps and people even make TF2 maps for art competitions, for example Mountain Lab, a favourite map for soldier of mine was in an art competition and managed to get into the game.  Next up, the items/trading. Trading is a big front of TF2, TF2 has such a large trading community and many websites dedicated to this. There are a lot of items and it can be confusing, especially after the recent updates, not we have grades of item, wears of weapons, strange skins, festive skins, SF skins. It is very confusing and it is not easy to get into anymore. The worst part is it is quite addictive, if you have money and access to put that money into TF2 you will probably end up buying items and unboxing crates/cases, who knows you might get lucky.  TF2 is great if you are looking for a stable game as well, it’s been going for 9 years and still lively. It looks good for its age and has only had a few graphical updates. However the updates recently aren’t fantastic, Valve doesn’t pay much attention to TF2, they are very pre-occupied by CSGO, even though they have a team working on TF2 they aren’t all that active, don’t rely on Valve to make the game great. Overall in my opinion TF2 is a very fun game, you can play it for years and not get bored. It can be casual or competitive, even if you don’t play or won’t play TF2 all the time it can still teach you a lot about gaming. Oh and its free, try it out.  "
Team Fortress 2 is the Best Fps I have ever played thanks Valve for making this awesome game and for it being free to play so all of the steam users can play .
"Team Fortress 2 is the best example of a good Free to Play game:   You can play multiplayer and the full game without paying.   You have access to all the weapons through the random drop system.   Players can buy tickets to play Mann Vs Machine, Mann Up, but it isn't required.   Free updates.   Lively community.   Optional character customization.   Tutorial mode.   Offline play.   Custom content creation.   Very few hackers.  This is why Team Fortress 2 is so good."
I have spent at least $50 on this game.  AND ITS FREE.  10/10 I GIVE IT A FOURTEEN.
Its okay I guess....
THIS GAME IS AMAZING YOU MUST TRY IT
The last Update was more like an Downgrade i wait more then i play and when you get an game the Balance is Terrible
Best hat simulator you can currently find out there.
Its a good game play it
"  Team Fortress 2 was released in 2007 and it is still going strong and attracting new players. It is a versatile, unique and extremely fun free to play first-person shooter that will offer entertainment for thousands of hours. Whether you want casual fun or skill-demanding competitive playing, this game is for you."
It is a cool game
This is a great game
♥♥♥♥
I always have so much fun playing with my mates
THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER I LOVE THIS
"If you like action, and sometimes mindless hilarity then this game is for you! There are many different aspects of the game and each loadout is a new way to play. It is extremely fun and most of the people you will meet on this game are very entertaining! The trading feature in the game is very useful as well, but there inlies one of the only flaws of this game. Often times after an update the trading network goes down as well as the item server so that you can't use your items for a while. These probelms are fixed quickly, but its still a tad bit annoying. All in all its still a great game, and as you'll see I have over 400 hours on record so I have a good idea of the game."
This f2p game is too addictive.
"''Yuss''; Yes, only yes. No doubt, no doubt, This is my one of the best and my favorite FPS game. This is a game, that you'll have an extremely different experience. If you've played other FPS games like CS, Halo, CoD, or BF, this is really different.   I was browsing Counter-Strike videos in YouTube, up until I saw some videos entitled ''Meet The Sniper'' ''Meet The Soldier'' blah blah. I was surprised by it's views. I was like ''This must be a famous cartoon!'' But, I just barely ignored them. By the time my brother tried watching the videos, I was amazed, again, because of it's awesomeness and exoticness. It was so different. And I was really willing to know and watch more of it. Now, I've known it was a Video game, an FPS, I am really willing to download this, Badly! However, I visited their website, IT'S FREE! FOR FREEKIN EVER! XD Soo, now enough with the discovery. --------------------------------- Moving on, again this game is different, you can't stand alone. By just reading it's title, you can tell what's it all about. TEAM FORTRESS 2. Work as a team, aid as a team, give attention. There are 9 classes, all them must reach this one objective to win and prevail their team. Each one must be practiced due to thier extremely different feels and gameplay.   The game is well designed, well balanced, but in some reasons and situations you'll find it unfair. Overall, the game is great, amazing, but children and D-bags, the idiots, the stupidly logical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, bronies, the blitches of items, mad runts,   U HAVE NO HATS F2P KID NEWB  is the only problem with the community. I've met so many amazing people from the game, It also has alotta unique gamemode, and I'd say that's awesome. There's always a good and a bad side for everything.  Awesome game, great experinces, 100% would still play it as long as it's entertaining us! Highly recommended, play the game, it's free. And as you see, most people that owns the game has 100+ hrs. Therefore, this game is really playable throughout the long hours.  If you wanna go seriously skilled, get the game, right now!  ''Unique.'' -Word that describes this.    9.9/10 "
"Endless replayability value from overall a simplistic game. The community contributions and custom game modes really add to the experience. Oh, and hats."
It is a good game filled with hats and the likes. Also one thing to note. THIS GAME IS EXTREMELY DIFFERENT FROM COD OR ANY OTHER RELATED GAME.
Great Game! Test It out and fall in Love with it!
Hat simulator with a mini fps game :)
"Lets just start it of by you might look at this game and think this game looks ''SUPER'' boring, but then when you start to play, jeez its addictive you start to buy hats and skins. But best of all i don't think anyone noticed the ''GOLD MINIGUN'' at the end of the first trailer you see for tf2 on the store page (steam)."
"I love this game. I love love love it. I started playing it around February 2014, when poor ROTMG got hacked a second time. I needed something to do. A friend I met through ROTMG and I started playing TF2 and we had a bunch of laughs.  Before TF2, the most tongue-in-cheek FPS game I'd ever played was Duke Nukem3D. (Yeah, I played DNF, but I had to stop. Being a female, I couldn't take the egregiously overwhelming misogyny -- which says a lot, because I absolutely LOVE DN3D to this day.) Yes, Half-Life has humor, as do Unreal and Unreal Tournament, but the games' stories in and of themselves still take themselves seriously and take you to another place entirely.  Once I started playing TF2, I became obsessed with it. I haven't experienced this level of obsession with 'something' since I discovered the LEGO Bionicle sets back in 2001. Now, if you've read my review for ROTMG, you'll know I have OCD. It's not difficult for me to get obssessed about PC games; they're in my blood. But not every PC game I play compels me to research the heck out of the game's mythos, or read the wiki like I was reading a good book.  SPOILER! SCROLL DOWN UNTIL YOU SEE THE END SPOILER TAG IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED!                    I'm VERy interested to know why the Heavy will not return to The Team.                       OKAY, YOU'RE GOOD NOW, THE SPOILER'S GONE!  This is a gloriously violent and bloody game. You will see gibs, you will hear agonized cries of death all around you. But you will also hear people roar with laughter at how they just capped the final point in a round being just a Medic ubering a Heavy. You will laugh yourself when you see your fellow Demoman detonate the mass of Stickybombs s/he just launched around the Payload and watch the gibs fly (yes. I have experienced these myself -- and laughed hilariously). Unlike similar games, TF2 shamelessly acknowledges its violent tendencies and invites you to partake in them. So grab your Minigun and fall in with the Soldier, Scout, Spy, Sniper, Medic, Pyro, Demoman, and Engineer, and get ready to kill some people!"
Very addictive game!
its the best game ever made
Shovelware with sniper screams
"this is a really fun game - my friends got me into this and at first I was hesitant, but after a while I was playing this everyday"
"An FPS that introduces a different style of play. Nine classes, each have a different task in the team, and each require different skill sets to play. Not only does one strive to master the classes, but also the various weapons unique to each class. Despite coming with a cost to have weapons (whether money or time in trading), it is definitely worth it if you have time.   I don't recommend this to people who are in a busy point of their lives, as it may be addicting to experiment with loadouts and whatnot. Though, if you've got time, take a shot, it's worth your while even if you don't stick around.   Also, as a final note, this game is far from a Pay2Win scenario. I've gained enough hours to have experimented with the many weapons, and I will say this: There are no weapons in the game that can be bought in order to destroy in a server. Even if a weapon has great stats (ie. The Back Scatter in the most recent update), in the long run the default is usually superior (unless someone has gained enough skill with such weapon). As long as you have skill, you can make a weapon destroy.  Good luck and remember: This is TEAM Fortress 2."
"This is by far the best Free to Play Game ever Made. TF2 Is More than just a Hat Simulator. Its a Hat Simulator with Guns! No Seriously, TF2 is Awesome. It Features 9 Classes which are All Needed to make a Perfect Team. (Except for Pyro. No one needs Pyros). It does have it Bad Sites because the Game is sometimes full of COD Kids who only Choose Pyro and also the Medic which is Highly Needed is Very Unpopular. Most People wont get that its TEAM Fortress 2 and not KILL EVERYONE ON THE FIELD Fortress 2. Also, The Trading is a VERY Big Part of TF2. So TF2 is VERY Different from Shooters like COD, Battlefield or Halo. I Recommend it. Highly."
"This game is a really fun massive FPS Multiplayer game and is perfect for getting cool hats, making new friends, and finding new weapons such as milk, cool pistols, etc. If you like silly FPS games, this one is the one for you."
team fortress 2 is a fantastic game the diversity between each class is astounding each class has unique dynamics which really set them apart from each other the fact that you can customize your character means that almost no two users will look the same one scout might be wearing nothing but a coat and the other scout might be wearing a ninja hood shirt and socks and each weapon has its own pros and cons well most of them and unlocking weapons is much different then other games like cod battleffield etc instead of having to level up to get items you can A. get them of the mann.co store or community market B. find them randomly the only thing about this though is you only have monday through thursday to do so also you only have 10hours extra playtime will not be rewarded whith drops and C. you can craft them. Another great thing is you dont have to level up at all and there nine classes each has a different role on the battlefield another thing is that the community is fantastic and extremely helpful for not so nice player there are 10 helpful ones in fact if you are having trouble you can look at some helpful guides that explain each class and how it works there is also a ton of community created content there are workshop items custom modes maps and so much more also you dont need to much of an expensive pc to run this at a decent fps. Also you can trade items. Did i forget to mention that this game is free also there is much teamwork in this game and there are so many taunts aswell you can interact with other players. So i would definately recommend this amazing fps title.
-Starts Game - has no idea what class to play -plays as heavy -goes on massacre because a medic is healing me -wins game 10/10 would heavy again
"This is the prefect FPS game there is! What makes this game great is that its 'Unique', There isn't a game like it."
"This game does take alot of space, but it is alot of fun to."
Someone may say that this game is a Hat Simulator but I have to disagree. I've spent over 1600 hours in it and I'm pretty sure that I wasn't trading that many. This is a great game with fantastic updates specially durning Halloween and I recommend TF2 to everybody.
"Awesome Game,its a must have!"
"I played a lot of this game in its prime, but the game as fell off. It is still great don't get me wrong, but it is way more of a sellout feel. I would recommend it to players that are new to steam or locking for people that want to have some fun with their friends."
I can practise setting people on fire and splitting their skulls open with barbed axes before I do it in real life. Thanks Valve :D
You click on other man and win hats for it. Is good. Is free. I like.
"This game is the first game I've ever played on Steam and I am glad it was, Team Fortress 2 is hella fun and there is many ways to enjoy yourself on that game which is why I love it so much. I also really recommend it if you like FPS games who require teamwork since that's what this game has all been about."
"Team fortress 2 was a great game a few years ago. It was something that no other game had ever masterd. This game unlike other game wasnt about winning it was about having fun and enjoying yourself with some loyal freinds.   But then darkness fell upon us, it spread its wings and crushed anything fun about this game. The legends fortold that this would happen but none could imaggen the horrors it had prepared for us. We didnt know when it would strike but we knew that it was coming soon.  It started with updates getting worse and worse, they added pointless stuff like being able to pick up weapons of the ground it might have been there just to appeal csgo players. Whatever the reasoning was only Lord Gabe Newell would know why it happend.  Months pass and a myth went around about a update that would change tf2 forever. As it turned out the myth became true but the update was anything but plesent. When the update was added the public servers also known as pubs where cruelly taken from us like a baby from his mothers arms and was replaced with a deformed monkey. The casual game mode was added and it didnt even work the first two weeks of the update. We tried to please the tf2 gods by deleting high value things but it would all be in vain. As it seems that the tf2 creators didnt even play this yet alone lissen to what the community has to say.   This update focused on the competive aspect of tf2 yet even that went wrong. Casual didnt work and competive could littrally kill a tf2 player by not being able to play the game ever again if he or she left a match too soon. No one could enjoy themself crit went rampit try-hards mercilessly slayed all the spy-crabs and Pootisbirds witch the community have worked so hard to preserve.  You might be asking how did you make it out of the rage and depression witch is the current tf2 community? I fled, I feld to a diffrent game yet still has that enjoyment tf2 had. I fled to Overwatch, It has the silliness tf2 had yet you can still try-hard now and again with mostly well working competive game mode. If you want tf2 like it was before I would recommand you to go while you still can.   Never in the history of tf2 has it been this dark before, however in order to say that it must have gotten lighter. while the tf2 team at valve probably code the games with their balls and ♥♥♥♥ on anyones opinion while drinking tea with EA, poeple of the community are taking up arms and trying to return tf2 too its former glory. By hosting add free community servers who do the normal map rotation like the pubs did before the update ( Thanks tf2crew). However Tf2 is just a shadow of its former self and only time will tell if tf2 will survive or perich.   - Pootisborn"
 My review on Team Fortress 2
Very fun game. Who knew dancing and guns went so well together.
It was worth the weight.
"Seriously what happened to this game...I've played it for 2 years. TF2 is one of the best fun FPS's I've played in my gaming life. And now it just went to complete ♥♥♥♥, for several reasons, the fact that they sold this unique game and made it resemble CS:GO is just plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with the skins and the level ups on official valve servers, now you have to wait 20 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes in order to play on a server which may not even have 5 people on it. This opinion might be biased but...the community in general just became more cancerous over the last few months with 'MLG' ♥♥♥♥♥♥s calling you 'hacker' because you killed them once. And the trading system is a complete bloody mess....you need a mobile phone, to download steam and then you can confirm your trades..oh and it's not an option, it's mandatory and if you don't have a Mobile phone well guess what mate, you can't complain for ♥♥♥♥ and you need to wait 15 ♥♥♥♥ing days for your items to come. This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I had no problems with the E-mail verefication step. Valve seriously if you're gonna put such a dumb ♥♥♥ rule for trading at least make it an option. This game in a nutshell just went to complete ♥♥♥♥ with everything, I would have recommended it 9 months ago. But ever since the skin updates...I don't recognise TF2 anymore. Good bye TF2 I'm uninstalling you."
"It is good game,everyone have fun,some take something serious but still funny ;) But there is 1 problem --&gt; They Should Make a section in vote to disable Random Crits!"
Miss a shot: NOOB HAHAHHAA!! Hit a headshot: OMG HACKER HACKER!!!!  Best game ever! 11 out of 10 hats
"This game is a must for ANY fans of FPSs or shooters for that matter. I wish most FPSs were half as good as this game is.  It's free-to-play. Got that? FREE... and guess what? NO IN-GAME PURCHASES THAT MAKE YOU BETTER. This game is in NO way a P2W (Pay-To-Win) game, it is in it's whole goodness a free game that's easy to pick up and play, easy to start off with and always fun to play.  The game has 9 different balanced classes that are excellent both in design and in gameplay, with each one changing your team's options of beating the enemy. With tons of weapons that can be gotten freely without paying, and are completly balanced, the game keeps throwing options of changing your playstyle. This game is great no matter what kind of player you are. Like to take it easy? Go as a sniper. Want to rush in and out before anyone notices and get in the enemy's faces? Go scout. Or do you feel like punching somebody in the face? Well guess what, there's a class for you (It's the heavy). With plenty of character, plenty of options, plenty of weapons and plenty of hours of fun in it, this game will not disappoint when you play it. So have fun!"
I dont know why some people think this is a bad game. Just because it has tons of glitches and exploits it doesnt mean its bad.
"Me 2 months ago: 'This game is over rated. And this hat craze is silly. I won't get addicted or buy any hats. What zombies you must be to do such a thing.'  Me now: 'I think I can sell my kidney for some money to buy hats.. Wait, I already did. Maybe I can go without my other kidney. They're over rated, anyways.'  10/10 Would waste whole paycheck on."
"I used to think that games used to be about skill and how well you work with a team of freinds/strangers. All that changed when I got TF2 (Hat Simulator 2014). I am educated now and know that the things you need to be good at this game are:  -Unusual Hats worth only $50000 -A once full, now empty life savings account -Hats -Hats -Hats  In this game you will select one of 9 characters which all have their special OP power which will make even the most patient monk rage quit. This game is about your character going on a pointless, perilous journey in order to get all the keys ever made by Valve. No one knows why you try and complete this story, but if you don't your freinds might get more keys than you and you don't want that. Eventually you spend all your money and/or life to buy these over-priced hats and boast to some guy on the other side of the world about how cool your $560000 hat is, only to have him call you a n00b and show you his $560001 hat and proceed to kick you from the server for being a skrublord. In this game you will experience several gamemodes such as:  -Kick everyone on the server who makes a mistake A.K.A Tour of Duty -Practice of Kick everyone on the server who makes a mistake A.K.A Boot Camp -Show off your sexy hats to people who you deem beneth thyself A.K.A Trade servers -School of sniping A.K.A 2fort -Custom gamemodes which can somtimes be more fun the the default game A.K.A Custom games -Every other gamemode with people who you deem Free2play A.K.A Every other gamemode with people who you deem Free2play   The best part of the game (apart from the 10/10 hat simulation) is when after 10 mins of you being one of the only contributors to your team and right about to win the game with your freinds, you get switched for 'auto-ballance' ad end up on a loosing streak. SO FUUUUUUUUUUUN AND BEST FEATURE OF ANY GAME!!!  Because of this game I have no money, no freinds and no life, but I have hats and really... isn't that what life is all about? 10/10 would play again"
It makes me rich  10/10 - Best game ever
volvo rebranded the game as a collect-athon where you try and get the coolest cosmetics  also it's on the verge of death  9/10 i enjoyed it thoroughly
best ham this year 10/10
used to think it was gay but now its ok
"Awesome game, so many different game modes and different ways to play the game!"
the best game team fortress 2 ♥♥♥
This game has to be the most fun I've had in years. Massive multiplayer and one huge community to keep it alive. This game might be getting old. But the fun it brings will never age.
I totally recommend this if you want a girlfriend
"Glad that you ask. Team Fortress 2 has been quite an eye catcher since it's release in 2007 Gaining Game of the Year awards Having it's own Large Fan base with Fads and Memes This is one of those games that seems to live on forever It's artistic style never goes out of style due to it's cartoonish rendering Customization is also a pinnacle of this game Hats and Items are bought nearly every day, netting Valve lots of cash each passing day.  The game itself is FUN More fun than you could imagine In fact, there are servers that are even dedicated to Fun However, if you're a Tryhard, Go ahead and try those Competitive Servers ! If you're a bit of both then just simply join a Public Server  Gameplay-wise This game is VERY FLEXIBLE Almost each class is tweakable to your own style of playing (Yes, there are a few OP weapons) The Scout can turn into a Speeding Powerhouse The Demoman can turn into a Melee Behemoth Even the freaking Medic can turn into an Offensive Class when used properly  The Community is also a Mix of Kind Players, Some could be Tryhard but will usually say the Good olg 'GG' or 'GG NO RE' on Arena However, Kids do appear in the game at times Some of them might even Mic-Spam, but don't worry ! You can just mute them, You can even kick them if the rest of the Server Clients agree with you  Overall, This is a GREAT GAME Community, Gameplay, The Game itself  9.9/10  -0.1 Due to the fact, If You're F2P You're considered a Second Class Player Unless you can Prove your Skill at this game You even get less backpack space Spend money on the game to get the full experience. "
"it is very good with its design, classes and objective but sometimes it will lag and slowly download"
Best game ever. Meet lots of friends!
"I think this game is awesome. Its got hilarious antics, Balenced gameplay (Not really), and addictive, winsom personalitied characters. My starting choice for first time players is the soldier. You can keep his loadout simple or tweek it in a way to aid in his ability or just helping your teammates out. And may i mention the mode that allows you and 5 friends to fight a horde of robots for loot! Although Steam/Valve isn't going to be adding any new weapons into the game, they're changing old ones to act like new ones. All in all, TF2 turns out to be one of the funnist games i've ever played! Go try it out for yourself and i'll see you on the battlefield."
I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH it burns my heart. i wasted like 150$ on this game. this is one of my most favorite PC games!! this game rating is 5 unusual hats!! HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATS!!!!!
My best game is so cool and is free!! but you need to buy some key is cool
"This game is a fascinating game with the distinct variety of f2p and p2p. This first person reality shooter game lives up to compete against other first-person shooters like its main rival CS:GO. Neverless, this fun, weird and certainly enjoyable game will stick around for many years to come."
"The most fun game i've ever played, along with Portal. Good job Valve"
Pretty good game with singleplayer and this game is so much fun when you tried it
Valve should make a clear distinction between competetive matchmaking and Pub play  If you just want to casually play you dont need a matchmaking that takes more than 5 minutes to find a game YOU CANT EVEN PICK WHAT MAP TO PLAY Bring the back the old 'show servers' for each gamemode  Matchmaking is a great thing but only the competetive one dont ruin basic tf2  After over 1000 hours of this game I actually am thinking about quitting the game because of this update
This is a must play for any who truly think they are a good 1st person shooter.
"I'm not even sure there could be something about this game that is negative at all. This in my opinion was one of Valve's best works, and one of the best shooters I have ever played."
"Mmmph mmm mmmp! (Meet the pyro) Burn players with your flamethrower or use magic to burn them, Either way your happy. :D     11/10"
"This game is the best game I have ever played. The graphics, updates, weapons and cosmetics. All Are amazing. What I would Like to see in the game is 5 Cosmetic Slots instead of 3."
"GOOD JOB VALVE!! ♥♥♥♥ed up another classic game, good work."
"Where to start on this wonderful game?  Team Fortress 2 is, as the name suggests, a team-based game where players are heavily encouraged to work together to comeplete the objective of that gamemode. In total there are nine classes you can play as: Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy. All these classes have been built specifically around teamwork and as a resault rely on each other in order to be effective. This in turn creates a dynamic experience that no other first person shooter multiplayer can get close to.  With fun maps, quirky characters and humorous jokes and weapons along the way, Team Fortress 2 has it all. You can taunt your enemies with chicken, tell your engineer to build a dispenser or even go shopping for hats.  There are a few bugs and problems in TF2, some of which can be fustrating at times and others just make you laugh, however Team Fortress 2 is a game that I highly recommend to anyone as their first PC game or to a game hoarder who knows everything about PC gaming. This game offers hours of fun and the community support ensures that this game is not going to die anytime soon.  Final score - 10/10."
GET THIS GAME NOW! what do you have to lose? its free
its a good game i recommend playing it
i have stopped playing this game half year ago but i still respect this game alot overall rating 9/10  good things -amazing community -maps are ballanced -classes are ballanced -music :D -so many different weapon choices -#gibus  bad things -trading yep! -economy -updates hats hats hats and hats

Fix your game. This new update is garbage. Not every one wants to play competitive. Good job on messing up the game :D
"Cheaters now run rampant. This update was a cheater's dream. It removed votekick.  The latest 'Meet your match' update completely destroyed the game by removing Valve pub servers. NO kicking cheaters, NO joining friends during a casual match, NO choosing your own maps. NO playing the entire map due to the stupid stopwatch mechanic.  NO good community server replacements. There aren't any. NONE."
  Team Fortress 2
"Valve, screw this update This update is the one that killed the game. -Removed quickplay, deemed to fun for all players.  -Replaced with tedious 'Casual mode' that penalizez you for leaving. -Takes hours to find a a gamemode and map that YOU do not choose whatsoever I haven't and will not play this game after the update until Valve cleans this puke stain on the floor they call 'Good' And I think we all know Community servers are bad. Good things ..... Uh you can click the medal while you are waiting for 30 minutes. For now this game is terrible but hey it is my opinion."
I love this game! I have meet new friends and have learned some inportant things! 10/10
You can have a penguin on your belt    10/10
You have to play this game if you dont you have issues my friend.
"Thought I reviewed this already.  It's a FPS alright. TF2 has an cartoonish style to it and 9 unique classes to choose from.  You can customize your characters with hats and beards and other hocus pocus which makes you create your own unique look and most of them can be colored in every color of the rainbow.  Every class has a variety of weapons to choose from to experience another sort of gameplay.  -Some what negative info-  The TF2 community is pretty bad.....unless you don't care w/e people say to you, then you're prolly gonna be fine."
  BEST GAME EVAH IN TEH WHOLE WORLD!!!111!!1
"Team Fortress 2, some people call it TF2, just in case you didn't know what they meant when they would say TF2. its massively multiplayer, first person, action, shooter, and just plain fun. You play as a character of 9 choices and fight the blue or red team to the death! Do I prefer this? Yes. It is a stunning massively multiplayer team selection game that anybody can get into. I don't know a single person who doesn't play this. If this isn't convincing enough for you to get it (it's probably not), then you should watch some of the trailers, they are hilarious. The best part about Team Fortress 2 is that it isn't $20, not $15, not $10, not $5, and not even $1. It is free. This amazing game that evrybody loves and is talking about is free. So go and get it! Nothing stopping you!"
THE BEST GAME IHAVE EVER PLAYED!
"Thanks for ruining pubs, Valve.   Now this game is a worthless piece of ♥♥♥♥."
A true classic. Everything valve makes-A classic. And what are classics? The best games EVER know to exist.  
"  Never played any other game this long, And i still can't stop playing. Definetly recommend it. TF2&gt;Overwatch!"
"If you play this game, you're going to have a good time."
"By far my favorite game. the characters have such good personalities. the weapons are quite well balanced (compared to some games) and constantly updated. I personally am not a cosmetic person unless they actually help me in some way, but there are many, many, many hats, bells, whistles, and other hats. i have been playing quite a bit, and got two friends wanting to play it too. probably the best part is that the people who play it are so diverse. you can have one server with a ton of jerks, and another with the nicest people in the world, and another with people who just want to have fun.   I won't deny, i do (sometimes) rage. the game can be hard, a walk in the park, an equal challenge, and everything in between!   But if you are looking at playing it, I mainly have 2 things to say/write: why haven't you gotten it already (it has been out for seven years((I think))and it is FREE) and also, just know you will not be playing cod or anything close to it.   and for the aspiring child who is looking to get their parents on board, just a few minor warnnings: first, there is blood, however that can be turned off, just look for a 'sillygibs' tutorial. second, there are mean people out there. I think that can be fixed too by turning off the ingame chat in options. third, there is a little cussing, no f-bomb, or poop-replacement (unless someone says it in the chat) but things like 'damn' and 'moron', etc. do occur in the scripting for the characters. maybe the worst is '♥♥♥♥♥♥,' kind of a staple of the sniper to say that. there may be a fix for that too that i don't know about. finally, if you are really young, you may be labeled as a 'squeaker.' it's a bullying term making fun of the fairly high pitched voice of a child.  my final thing to say is this: it is my favorite game, and I have not met a fps gamer who tried tf2 and did not like it. I absolutely LOVE IT!!"
"Team Fortress 2 Is One Of The Best Multiplayer Games I've Ever Played. It Does Take Time Out Of My Life But I'm Glad It Was Something Fun. With Unlockable Weapons + Wearable Costemics, TF2 Lets You Kill Others In Style. Each Class Has Their Own Personalty, As Shown In Meet The Team Series + The Great Music That Valve Made For The Series Too. The Teams, RED + BLU Have Very Nice Colors + With Names Tag, That Let You Rename, Hats + Weapons. Each Slot (Offense/Defence/Support) Have 3 Classes, Showing What They Do Best.  I Would Highly Recommend This Game To Anyone."
Tf2 is a fun and action packed game with multiple play styles. Tf2 is and addicting and surprisingly fun game to play wether your with your friends or buy yourself you will have fun. Tf2 is also a very social game with new friends or mvm buddies the community is alwase open to anyone where you can meet new people and lean thing from guides or stats of weapons
"The last update changed the game completely. You cannot choose your map anymore, matchmaking has become sluggish, most games are over within 5 minutes (so back to matchmaking with you), you cannot switch teams, you cannot easily join friends either... Do I really need to go on ? That update was one update too much, Valve. The game is dead."
"Come for the killing, stay for the hats"
"This game is all about the hats.   The weapons in this game are balanced, and very fun to play with.  I highly reccommend this game."
*this game includes* YATATATATATATATATTATATATATA
"Amazing free to play FPS, very old but still getting attention(!), recommended for everyone who likes FPS games, but also enjoy cartoonish games."
"heyy, that's pretty good"
"Well I can recommend it. I for a while did not like it. It is very well executed. The classes are balanced surpisingly compared to the typical freeium fps. This game I can not consider a sequel to Team fortress classic due to a HUGE CHANGE! But entirely different game all together. Looks nice. Very interesting concept. Throws a couple refrences from Allidin, spectifically. ' YOUR ENTERNAL REWARD! '. This is like the big budget game of Valve essentially. But there is a huge flaw. Some of the level designs are mazes..... Being serious. This is like a paid game without paying... But you will have to get used to the classes and such. Always AIM AT THE HEAD!"
i kill heavy with fish 10/10
Objective of the game : Get cool hats and get cool weps like aussies. 10/0
"First, I want to say that this game is not meant for everyone.Even though this isn't meant for everyone it doesn't mean that you should give up on it. Try playing everything you can with the game. This can range from classes to gamemodes. Their are a bunch of mods that can keep you entertain for a long time but it depends on you how much is 'everything'. Overall, this game is still a fun game as long as you take this game casually and have fun with alot of learning."
10/10 i really like this game like if u think so :D
Uh... I'll write this review in a sec... just 1 more game...
"The best free to play game around, better than a lot of premium titles with a great community and an awesome team of developers."
"In general, the game is good. Good, easy to operate, nice looking graphics. Cons I have not yet revealed."
Really an awesome game
this game is awesome and adicting
"To all Gamers out there... If you guys are looking for games that include gore, multiplayer, and FPS... This is the right game for you... This game also includes HATS!!! There are 9 characters to choose from, and the 9 are divided by 3 groups, first group is Offense, second group is, Defense, and third is support. In the offense group there are the characters Scout, Soldier, and Pyro... In the group defense there are the characters Demoman, Heavy, and Engineer... And finally the third group we have the support group and that group has the characters Spy, Medic, and Sniper. That's all i can say... Have fun."
"  Team fortress was a great game until gun mettle happened.  But keep playing it but if we get another god damn contract update like tough break, im leaving."
I Recommend this game Tf2 Is a fun and great game for FREE
"♥♥♥♥ing horrible, Wouldn't ever waste my time with this ♥♥♥♥.  10/10"
"Amazing FPS if you ask me, various classes each of which specialize in different weaponry, tons of Weapons, Hats and more! Fun game modes too like CtF, Hardpoint, Payload and more. Id reccomend this game to anyone new on Steam, it helps getting used to Trading, Cards, Ingame Purchases, Refferals, Friends and more! 5/5 10/10~"
This is a review for TF2. It is a good game. That is all.
"IT'S ♥♥♥♥ SINCE THE RECENT UPDATE  DO NOT DOWNLOAD, DO NOT GET PREMIUM"
"Loved this game awhile back when it was actually playable. now it wont even let me join a casual game. it acts like i have never even clicked the option to. Valve, please fix this. your game has become unplayable."
"Today I shall bring up an important question. Can a game go too far? In short, yes. Team Fortress 2 sent hat simulators way too far by adding guns to it. But unlike other things that go too far, Team Fortress 2 actually improved the hat simulator genre with guns. Yes I certainly reccomend the best hat simulator in the whole world."
"Great game, the animation makes it feel like your actually in the game! Definately recommend this great game and the best part? HATS &gt;:)"
"I spent $105 on a Free to Play title. Skill doesn't matter in this game, it's all about how much hats you own."
It's Good!
this game is the ♥♥♥♥ 
"Team Fortress is a multiplayer action,shooter game where you can choose between classes(pyro,medic,heavy,engenire,spy,scout,solider and demoman).It realy fun,and it not requare a good pc!!!! I hope you will play this game."
It's not about who wins. It's about whoever has the coolest hats that wins.
a gosh darn good game. frickin luv it!
"Overall great game. A bit bloody, but still very cartoony. 5/5."
"This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fulfill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels. The game has an active dev team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons or game modes.  At the time of this review, there are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'.  Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objective or objectives for each team to achieve.  'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, 'Mann Up', gives rewards upon completing a 'tour'.  In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available.  In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them.  The game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play. I have been playing since November 2007 and I still return to the game on a regular basis."
Just. ♥♥♥♥♥ing. Awesome. This is the ultimate Valve title. Not since Counter-Strike has a muli-player game been this much fun. 10/10.
What can I say about this game that hundreds of thousands of other people haven't already?
"For a free game, this exceeds any and all standards. Allowing you to play for free, while giving you the option to go into the world of 'premium membership.' With cartoony gameplay and a comic series, what can go wrong? Plus, you have a thriving community creating updates for the game! It can't get better than this! My favorite part is getting the task done, as a team. Most people don't do that, but its fun once they do."
"Great game, and easy to get into... great sense of humor."
team fortress 2 is a brilliant game which sucsesfully orients its self around extream vilonce (first person shooter) but pulls it off with a comical feel hopeing to make people take it less seriosly. the game also has an ultrapenerial aspect to it with scrap banking involved and also some items with more than £5000 you can get lots of money for doing these things. i would recomend this to someone who has never had much experiance with FPSs and especily someone who has not played call of duly alot becuase of the very diffrent battle styles. this game would be perfect for someone who is above the age of eight.
"10/10  my favourite game ever, characters are really awesome as well. "
  The only gamei love Free to play!!!
This is the first steam game i got and i was immpresed on the quality of this free to play game (in app purcahses may be required for certain content Hats &gt;:( I love the MANN VS MACHINE  I have to Comment about people saying that this game sucks because you get addicted to hats. It;s not True. Who Cares about hats if you want to waist money on fake pixelated items buy them all you want This Game still is one of the best games ever (plus it's FREE!!!!!)
"One of the best free-to-play models on Steam. There are better, but this is definitely a great example. You can either stay 'F2P', and receive weapons and crates as drops. Or, you can buy anything from the 'Mann Co. Store', and receive Premium, which gives you a free hat in the process, depending on whether you're buying it from in-game, or on the online store.  It has multiple playstyles, varying from class to class and weapon to weapon. Default weapons for the Scout provide a different playstyle to one for example a Force-A-Nature, Bonk and Sandman Scout. Depending on your style of humour, the Mercenaries can be funny, morbid(ly obese) or sarcastic. They each have their own personality (which are magnified by 'SFM' (Source Film Maker) videos), which brings out the 'reality' of the characters.  Also, free content updates with a huge community and amazing videos used with film software? That's right, you get all of that.  All in all, it's definitely a game worth trying. If you like it, you can continue playing, maybe eventually even help out a little bit by contributing money and guides to the developers and community (respectively). If not, feel free to uninstall the game and bide your time with some other game. Steam (and I) are not forcing you to play it.  If you did read this far, thanks. I hope you enjoy the game or have already enjoyed it."
Very good game being free to play only limits small stuff and can run good on even laptops 9.5/10 Now all i need is an identical twin to play with me
"A whole ton of fun, recommended for all skill levels. A truly F2P experience, paying money does nothing but add to the endless possibilities the F2P version of the game already has. One of the best communities on Steam, the great players this game has to offer only enchance the experience further. A truly great game, TF2 recieves updates on a regular basis, and almost all of these updates only makes the game more enjoyable. All in all, a solid 9.5/10."
"'I got rewarded for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥' -Dr. Cake, MD"

"If you like hats, dancing, playing dress up, or have a gambling addiction, then this is the game for you."
It's pretty good.
Only for men . . .
"Great OFPS, would recommend to any fan of shooter games."
"one of my favorite multiplayer games it's brilliant and fun simply it's awsome i vill give it a 8,9"
WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED? I LEAVE A WEEK THEN COME BACK TO NOT BEING ABLE TO PLAY MY FAVEORITE GAME. EVERYTHINGS CHANGED I NEED TO PAY TO GET IN MATCHES FAST AND HACKERS RUN AROUND FREELY. FIX IT PLEASE
"This is the best game ever, even if people call you a f2p ignore them and play the game 10/10"
I've gotten 400 hours into this game because of it's awesome gameplay and its addicting search for items.
"It had appeared that Valve abandoned the game,especially with the not well received Meet your Match update. However, in recent news and blog posts that the dev team has put up, it seems that there is still hope! Regardless, Team Fortress is still one of my favorite games.   9/10"
Screw the new update. That's all I have to say about this.
I request this game to be renamed Conga of Duty: Advanced Breadfare.  11/10
"One of the funnest team based FPS ever, and it's free. Why aren't you playing RIGHT NOW?!"
"This isn't just a cartoony Call of Duty, it's much more. Unlike CoD, Valve doesnt just search from the box of generic and bland for their story, it's full of color and dynamic the story for all these characters. It's not realistic and that's another great thing about it, it's not like every other popular fps game ever which just chose a modern time and modern weapons and an unfair leveling system, It has hats."
It used to be Great game and had the best community until the Uber update!  Now its just ok.
A game in which you have to play with others to protect your box fort. Nothing more to say.
"Before Team Fortress 2 I was a rich man, I had wealth to rival Midas himself. I bathed in gold flake. My furniture was made of solid platinum, shined to a mirror finish. Even my clothes were embroidered with golden thread and studded with diamonds. ... That was until I found TF2. I pawned all of my belongings... I bought hats. I own... Hats... Hats...  11/10"
"It's amazing how a game released in 2007 continues to be fantastic fun in today's times. Even after roughly 2 years of playing this game, I am not tired of the good times to be had in this game with friends. The yearly Halloween and Christmas events I now look forward to every year, and the other updates now and then such as 'Love and War' or 'Invasion' add new content to the game, making me come back for more.  Team Fortress 2 was the first FPS I gave a serious attempt at playing, and I was swept in within the first month of playing. I definitely hope to see this game continue to excell to greater heights!"
What happened to the tf2 i knew and loved? Why did Valve make such a useless update??
"The best part about this game was how casual it was, and how I could just join a game, listen to music, and relax. Why did they bother with comp. Hell, I'm all in for comp (though I don't really like competitive games) but (basically) getting rid of the thing that most people enjoyed about this game is so stupid.  Valve, focus class and weapon fixes off CASUAL not COMP. Vast majority of players play casual, and gameplay between both modes differ so much that satisfying one is hard without ♥♥♥♥ing another over. Either that, or make a whole new set of rules for comp.  The best thing Valve can do right now is bring back Quick Play.  Also, wtf is this ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ push ♥♥♥♥ with the shortstop? who asked for that? why is it even a thing?"
For a 'free' game I spent waaay too much money lol.
"I started playing this game on the first day of 2015, had the most fun i ever had in a pc game. Took me a while to get used to all the classes and was having fun until the new update has appeared. The older updates was not really a big problem for me so i kept on playing. But when THAT UPDATE CALLED MEET YOUR MATCH. really ♥♥♥♥ed up everything of what i thought about this game. A few days before the update occured, i said to one of my friend, ''i hope this never changes....'' I soon regret what i said and it actually happened. For over 120 of sniper, i actually got the hand of it, now the piece of ♥♥♥♥ update came up, it seemed like all of my work is down the drain and ill never get those hrs back. Honestly, i liked the competitive option it gave when PUBS WERE STILL ALIVE. I usually go back and forth to keep me entertained.... Bit once they added casual, i knew it was going to be a pain in the ♥♥♥ to play this, even the matching queue was a problem, even after they fixed it, at last of all, WHY WOULD THEY REMOVE ''join game'' FEATURE, that was a drop in for friends if u were ina game already. NOW YOU HAVE TO WAIT ABOUY 10-15 minutes to join ur friend's lobby when they finally finished their game!!! Im sorry but i believe this is the end of the road for me. And dont say '' play a differernt game'', because this was my first pc game and the first i liked to play. Good luck Valve......"
"Best game, takes your time, your money, and your bordom. With a huge community and a lots of interesting gamemodes!"
its very fun
So here's my latest review for one of my favorite games. Up until recent weeks.  I go to matchmaking since the recent update allows to matchmake. Everyones happy.  I join a server of 2fort.  Both teams are pretty stacked in an even game.  I make a push as a scout take down 2 sentries in the intel room and grab the intelligence. I get back to my side of the base and die.   A teammate picks it up so i figured he'd cap it.  Welp i thought wrong.  He sits in the intel room for 45 minutes. Teammates urging him not to cap it and some urging him too.   Multiple kicks are voted to kick John_Luise for IDLE and he wins and doesnt get kicked everytime.   He had a bandwagon of goons backing him  Another vote kicked popped up to kick someone against John_Luise and the guy gets kicked unfairly.  Another one and the same thing happens.   After a short period of time i get pissesd off and try to get John_Luise to either cap or get kicked.   The bandwagon of goons then decide to kick me.  After 2 hours in a server and 250 score i get kicked.   Lost all XP over some ♥♥♥♥tards in the bottom of our intel room trying not to cap.   http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044430140  John_Luise ^ Fat Hitler was another Brotel California is the another and a few others i forget the names of. Either way this is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  ♥♥♥♥ your game until you fix it.  Cheers Valve.
Be Warned that Now with this Game no longer allowing Player Team Kick From hackers The % of them Has increased Tremendously. Sorry to Say but this game has hit it's all time Low at this point. Suggest Playing Other Games that are more Protected then this Game at this point. The game its self could Possibly (Cuase a Virus just from playing it).  I Used Money on this Game at one point To unlock crates. Not worth Losing So much time and effort just to be killed by Several Aim Botters Since now they have a Public KD ratio on your Team Fort 2 Profile.   20/10 Needs More Security  1/3 Matches there is a Hacker &gt;.&gt;
"What was once a great game has been runied by recent updates that seem to have been created by people who i can only imagine never actually play the game . The new matchmaking system is a joke and is filled with flaws that make it near unplayable. the casual play has you waiting for 10-20 min to find a game with decent ping, and once yo find a good server you cant even stay on it once the game is over.  all i can say is maybe the people responsible for tf2 updates should maybe try playing the game for a start."
Team Fortress 2 may be one of the highest quality free to play games out there.
It's alright I guess
"this game is amazing, it is so much fun and i just cant stop playing it its so addicting and there are so many weapons to try out. best game ever, i totally recomend it"
One of the greatest multiplayer games ever. Now free!
i love this game i am bot bot loves tf2
"TF2! What can I say about, awesome lore, gameplay, humor, talented and dedicated Programmers and Artworker, stylish trailers and even Comics and of course; the fantastic community! The flaws of the game are the overlong respawn time on the official servers, but the community server are mostly with instant respawn, so that is not a problem anymore! If u want teamplay to capture your goals or just wanna have fun with other people, Team Fortress 2 is your game!  And Hats, looots of byoutiful Hats &lt;3"
"Team Fortress 2 is by far one of the most fun games I have ever played. One of the main factors, if not THE main factor for this is the diversity. I used to play some MMORPG's for example and one thing that annoyed me the most was, that after a while there's nothing interesting, nothing different than either quests and leveling. Of Course you cannot compare such games with a shooter. But this games has more diversity than just beeing a shooter. First of all, what initionally made me pick up this game in the first place was it's graphic style. It's just crazy. I mean in which other game you can SPAM a rocket launcher rather than shooting once and then reload 10 minutes. And it's just called Rocket Launcher, not RPG 8621. Or just having the possibility blowing everything up with the demoman. This leads me to my next very important factor, the class diversity It's even stated by Valve in their developer commentaries, that they wanted to make each and single class completely different from each other. And creating even 9 of them. Each one has a completely independent playstyle from the other classes. You can't compare a crazy and flink guy like the scout with the silent, sneaky frenchman spy. There is literally everything a casual gamer could play. From going Ham Pyros, down to defending Engineer. Every role has it's place, even though some weaknesses of the classes are more punishing than others. With that beeing said, I'm moving onto my next factor, the Teamplay This one is something that exists in the game itself, though rather disguised in public games. Even though the game has the possiblity of using voice chat, most players don't use it at all. I actually don't know the exact reason, except because the others don't do it either, but surely it would add to the teamwork part of the game. This follows my transition to the next topic, the Competitive 'area'. This one is little bit hidden. Many people participate in Pick-Up-Games where you get some random people to play with and against. The point of these games are getting structure and predictability into the Chaos and craziness of TF2. You play either 6 versus 6 OR 9 versus 9 games, in which you either can pick beetween one of two Scouts, one of two Soldiers, one Demoman and one Medic, OR 1 guy for each class (also called Highlander). In these games, the factor teamwork starts getting very important and impactful. Communication is mostly supported by the voicechat programm Mumble so you don't have to push this damn key everytime you want to say something. Mechanical skill is always useful, handy and important in solo situations, but you will loose even with good mechanics, if they enemy team is working together better than your own.  At the end I can say that Team Fortress 2 is one of the best (actually F2P) games I have ever played. It's is fun for newcomers, it has a skillcap, so you can practice if you want, you can use voicechat to work with your team or just playing 15 min because you have nothing better to do. If you want to dive deeper into this game, you can go play competitive, improve your skills, your teamwork abilities, and combine this for an awesome amount of fun and joy. "
There is no better FPS game to have fun on!
This game is the best FREE game I've ever played!
"I just noticed, TF2 has a 75 percent off..   Turns out. the originally price was 20 dollars before it went f2p...  75 % off, its f2p..  gg volvo"
"I saw one dude with almost 12,000 hours of time put into this game. That's almost 500 days, like a year and a bit in game. It's like that Anime, Sword Art Online, where they spent like 2 years in a video game, except this one due willingly did this. If his devotion doesn't sway you, this will.  Over the years, TF2 has had many many things put into it, but here are some to name a few: HATS CONGA DRUNKEN CYLCOPSES SANDVICHES ARCHIMEDES BONK BALLOONICORNS ROBOTS TAKING AMERICAN JOBS NOPE JARATE(Jared pee) BACKSTABS AND FACESTABS AND ALL THE IN BETWEENS SENTRY, BIG AND ANNOYINGLY SMALL AND BEST OF ALL, ROCKET AND STICKY JUMPS.  and hats."
"The legendary class-based FPS, Team Fortress 2. What can be said that hasn't already been said? Play 'Hat Simulator 2,' as some affectionately call it, and you'll see what I mean. Strickingly memorable and lovable characters, an amazingly well-executed atmosphere, and satyrical gore and humor, it's an unforgettable setting that's paired with a super-solid game engine and superb FPS gameplay. It's even free now! No excuses."
"Good game but it needs an big update with new characters and maps, etc.. Like this post if you agree that it should !"
TF2 is a fun game
Great game before all the added items. Now is more about how you look than how you play but still fun.
This is my favorite game this game have very loot of items and things what you can do
Fun and great game ( also free 2 play)
"Team Fortress 2 is one of the best multiplayer games i have ever played. And also, one of the most played games. I spent a lot of hour in this game. The fun thing in this game is that you can troll everybody. And you have a big variety of classes and weapons to do this. I was able to find only one problem: hacking. I got so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off because of that people... Anyway.. Concluding, i recommend it to everybody. It's a nice game. Worth it. ^^"
I love that throughout the game you get items and cosmetics (or hats) and also that unlike some games i play you get more classes to choose from. I also like the crits and powerups you get during the game. However i don't like that admins aren't around most times if there is someone causing trouble or hacking. But Team fortress 2 is a really great game overall.
"Aren't you glad Team Fortress 2 didn't wind up looking like this? Valve has created quite a game with the long-awaited Team Fortress sequel, bearing many similarities to its predecessor, though incorporating enough changes to make it feel fresh. The most obvious aspect, which you may have noticed from any of the screens and video posted, is the visual style. Even after getting sucked into probably too many hours of play in the beta over the past few weeks, we're still amazed at the art design, both in how it looks and how it animates.   But let's not get too carried away with the graphics. It's a game, after all, and the most important factor is how it plays and if it's entertaining. It's interesting to see both Team Fortress 2, which has been in development on and off for some seven years now, and Splash Damage's Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, which has seen its own share of setbacks and delays, finally come out right around the same time. Their nearly simultaneous retail release presents and interesting situation for you, the consumer, as to how to spend your cash. You may fondly remember your days in Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, dropping air strikes on hapless attackers and eagerly charging into bunkers to spout forth deadly plumes of flamethrower fuel. Yet you can't forget your days with Team Fortress Classic, or even further back with the original Team Fortress Quake mod, with its now painfully dated character models but compelling team-focused online play.        There's really no right answer in this case as to which game is ultimately better. It's merely personal preference. Quake Wars is assuredly the more complicated game. For those uninitiated in the ways of Enemy Territory, the scope, dynamic objectives, speed at which the tide of battle can turn and the number of things you need to quickly consider when that happens, and user interface can be rather daunting. After learning the ins and outs it's clearly an excellent product, but it lacks that immediate, irresistible appeal so prominent in Valve's Team Fortress 2. And accessibility may very well be the deciding factor in determining which product users prefer. Regardless, it's an excellent time to be a gamer, since as tough as it may be to pick one or the other, making either choice rewards you with a well designed and highly entertaining title.   Like in Team Fortress Classic (TFC), Team Fortress 2 has nine character classes: Spy, Pyro, Soldier, Heavy, Medic, Sniper, Demoman, Scout and Engineer. Each class' abilities on the battlefield have been streamlined, which, along with the graphics, is what makes Team Fortress 2 so much more accessible than TFC. No longer do you have Engineers running around with railguns and EMP grenades. Medics can't 'infect' the other team, Spies don't have tranquilizer darts, and none of the classes have hand grenades.   In TF2, each class has roughly three main ways of attacking - a primary weapon (the Heavy's minigun, Pyro's flamethrower, Engineer's sentry gun, etc.) and secondary (various classes have shotguns, others pistols, while the Demoman has a highly effective mine thrower) and melee weapons (the Scout's bat, the Medic's bonesaw, and so on). Though classes now possess fewer means of attacking, the resulting gameplay feels much more focused. Each class has a very clearly defined role and the means to ensure they perform successfully. The only limiting factor is, of course, how effectively your team meshes together.        If your Engineers aren't guarding their structures, Spies can wipe them out in seconds with a few sapper charges. If your team is full of Heavies and Soldiers but lacks Medics, you're not going to get very far. If you're playing a capture point map without any Scouts on your team, you might as well just leave the server or start berating your squadmates until a few switch classes. The Medic, though, seems to be the hinge on which all gameplay balance swivels. For TF2 they've been given a health hose, which blasts out a restorative stream at friendlies within range and 'sticks' to them as long as you keep the fire button depressed. As you heal injured teammates, or 'overheal' to 150 percent health, an ubercharge meter builds in the bottom right of the screen. Unleashing this renders both target and Medic invulnerable for a few seconds, which is sometimes the only way to break through chokepoints populated with Heavies, Medics, and multiple tier three sentry guns.   Even though Medics may be the most vital to a team's success, the other classes remain useful. Scouts, who are now rather deadly, are far and away the fastest, and their ability to double-jump and change direction in mid-air makes then all the more difficult to hit. Spies, in addition to being able to one-hit kill backstab the enemy, cause general chaos among enemy ranks. If your opponents know a spy is running around, they'll waste time and lose focus by shooting at their own teammates to try and reveal a disguised culprit.   Pyros tend to be the most effective spy detectors, and can be frequently seen doing fiery pirouettes in 2Fort matches all over the beta servers, as a spy incognito will betray his cover by bursting into flames upon contact with the burning spray.In a September 26 Steam update, friendly fire was removed from TF2, which was definitely a good move. Friendly fire ruins much of the game considering the close-quarters maps combined with the wide area of effect attacks of Heavies, Pyros, Demomen, and Soldiers. Without FF, teammates are free to shoot each other, since if they bleed health, they're a spy."
yes I recomend this because its just a really fun game. and if you believe me you wouldn't be reading this comment/ review and be playin it cuz its just plain AWESOME. :D NOW GO PLAY WHOEVER IS READING THIS! GO PLAY!
"AWESOME. FUN. Don't give up if you only last 4 seconds in game, just keep playing you'll get better. ;)"
Nice Game Competitive But Also Fun
One of the best multiplayer games made to this day.
Great Game.
It's free  -funny  -better then CoD  -each character has a background story  -multiple gamemodes  -hats  -hats  -keys....and hats  - I have an octopus for a hat    hat/hat 
"Team Fortess 2... one of my favorite games of all time. A few people call this game, easy, requires no skill and a kids game. These people are completly wrong, as they are the ones getting killed all the time. I have met loads of amazing people on this and have had some of my best gaming moments.  I recomend this game 100%. Stop reading, get this game. Now"
Excellent game for a fps game! I recommend to anyone who likes shooter games!
You all know this game is good. Just play it.
"Team Fortress 2.  Where to start? When I was living in my first apartment in 2012 after I graduated from highschool I was working for my family in our Scrap Metal business. Everyday I would come home clean up and get on my Qosmio 2011 gaming laptop and start up Steam.  The first time I played Team Fortress 2 was on the Xbox when I bought the awesome Orange Box bundle. I bought it to play Portal mostly. When I did attempt to play Team Fortress 2 I was overwhelmed by the fact people were using rockets to 'blow themselves up' as to fly across the map. I didn't think much of the game and didn't touch it again until...  One day after work I was browsing the Free to Play section looking for something new to fit my tastes. I saw Team Fortress 2 was highlighted as a most played game, I was a bit confused how the game was still around and why so many people were playing it. At that point I had to know why so many fellow PC gamers were heavily invested into this ancient game. I installed and opened up the game. I noticed immediately the changes compared to the Xbox version and joined a random community server.   Now here I am almost nine hundred hours in and I have never once uninstalled this game."
I have been playing MVM for 36 hours straight. I think i have a problem. So Addicting. I have to stop typing and go play some more...
"Best game I've ever played, fun forever (unless you're a CoD kid). Sometimes it gets boring, but you'll eventually come back to it. Probably one of my favorite games of all time."
"By far, the best Free-To-Play FPS out there. Need I say more?  I need to?  Really?..  Alright, if that's what you want.  In all my days I have yet to come across a game quite like  Team Fortress 2.   And by that I mean;  'Holy crap this is the best thing ever 1337/10 -IGN all hail Mighty Gaben #Conga4Days #Fabulous #NoFilter #Medic4Life #SaveTheSpyCrabFoundation #Pootis #MeeM #SeduceMe #TeleportedBread #Archimedes #Oktoberfest'   With regular updates containing cosmetics, weapons, maps and the like; I don't feel Valve will be stopping the TF2 Train  anytime  soon."
69/69 would mix with tub of butter and rub on body until nips are hard
"TF2 Is A Game Fit For First Person And (Sometimes) Third Person Shooter Game (Well,The Mod...).It Has lots Of Types Of Gaming (Mvm,Capture The Flag Etc..) And There Quite Fun!.How i First Found Out About TF2 Is Firstly My Friend Had A Skype Photo Of The Medic And I Asked Him..'Whos That?' He Replyed 'Medic...' 'From What Game?' 'TF2'.I Was Wondering What TF2 Standed For So I Asked 'What Does It Stand For?' 'Team Fortress 2 -.-'.I Didn't Really Know What It Was So I Searched It Up And Found Out it was FREE! So I Had to Get Steam and Join The Community So I've Joined And Downloaded It.IT WAS AMAZING! So I've Kept Playing Till 2014 and STILL Will.I'll Never Quit.I've made ALOT Of Friends And Wanna Make More.Overall,TF2 Is An AMAZING Gun Game And i Recommend This To ALL Gun-Game Lovers!"
help me please.
"I love this game. The Hats, The Weapons, The Quirky Characters, Cheeky humor. It surpasses CoD, Halo, and BattleField by FAR. If you haven't played Team Fortress 2 yet, you need to.  Also, after a ton of game hours, you will always hear Heavy eating a sandvich Minigun ringing KA-BOOM! DOCTOR! POOTIS PENCER HERE NEED A DISPENCER HERE! BONK! MMMPH! SPY! And so on. Great game. Hat Simulator 2015. Great community. 10/10 wuld bang agen. -IGN"
"This is by far, the ONLY FPS in my eyes. Like, the only one in the world. True there is CoD, there is Battlefield, etc and so forth. But this game has a charm to it, that incredibally fast-paced, all action... STUFF that makes it great.  AND it's a free game! So, really, you don't need to worry about wasting, like, $15 or $200,000. Honestly, if you JUST got steam, you NEED to try out this game first.  Like... Need.  I'm not kidding. Go play it."
This game is not like any other game it is exciting and had many game features available.If your reading this i advise you stop reading this and get the game.I am 100 percent sure that in 2 weeks you will be excited whenever you play this amazing game.
Very high paced action game!
"Now, before you skip past this review, just take a moment to have a look. This is my opinion: Team Fortress 2 is one of the best Free To Play games I could ever have. I belive the game used to cost something, but now it is free. The download time isn't one of those games that take 2 days and then if you quit you have to restart it. You can resume the download at any time, and it doesn't take long to install the game. Now for the actual GAMEPLAY. The TF2 Gameplay is amazing. Powerups, Taunts, Upgrrades, AI's, Weapons. Thy are all amazing features that is each something that makes Team Fortress 2 well, Team Fortress 2. The way the game is animated, and the blood, means it is a bit more friendly towards younger players. The controls can be edited to the desired key (as most Steam games) which makes it easier to play, and you don't have to remember different controls for different games. The maps are very good within content, and features. They are very detailed and hardly ever glitch. The game doesn't usually lag, ranging from (worst) 4 - 37 (amazing) FPS rate. This is a long review, so lets summarize...  Team Fortress - as I said earlier - is one of the best (if not best) F2P game I have, and many others have. Hopefully, if you don't own the game yet, you soon will.  Enjoy the game."
"Hats, 10/10 would hat again"
"one of the best games i've seen yet, funny, amusing, and game play u can't fine anywhere else!"
"Good game, I spent some time on it :)"
It's alright.
this game made me gay and took all the money from my bank account
"It's gameplay and balanced classes are what make the game something I love to play in my spare time, it also is nice how valve allows players to create items that can be tested and possibly put into the game making the game have all the bells and whistle a player like me would want. For what it's worth (and it's free), it's a great way to blow off some steam and relax while still getting the action and the fun that is in a great FPS."
The best F2P game ever.  11/10
"became complete ♥♥♥♥ because of the latest updates  10/0 -IGN, it's like minecraft without blocks"
Can kill robots and push them back while screaming you shall not pass.  Gandalf simulator 2015  10/10 would Gandalf again
Makes you feel good when you can burn people!!!!
this game is really fun it makes me smile a lot and i enjoy putting my ♥♥♥♥ in the disc tray whenever it it playing
"Team Fortress 2 is an amazing game! Despite the violence, it can actually improve a person's life skills, i.e. Teamwork, Budgeting, Strategy, etc. For those who don't own this game, you MUST GET IT!  The game revolves around the idea of First Person Shooting and Teamwork, requiring specific objectives for certain maps, like Capture the Flag or King of the Hill.  We find a lot of focus in the cartoony aspect of the game, hence the obnoxious taunts and the goofy hats found in-game.  However, people have been known to strike major profit with the rare Unusual cosmetic/taunt/weapon unboxing, somewhat similar to the unboxing known in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or Unturned.  Have fun, but don't waste too much money trying to unbox 50 different crates!"
its a really good game buy it and luv it babies
its ok
"I can not say it good , but i must say is extremly awsome games!!!!!!"
"-Conga -Hats -Fun -9 Classes -Scotish ♥♥♥♥♥ using eplosives -Hats -Bread -Blood, War and explosions  What the heck you waiting for? GO PLAY IT"
bought it for the story line but then hats came along now im in deep debt living off wellfare 12/10
Setting a hat on fire multiplies its value by hundreds. 16.3/10
this is the best game ever created
I don't even know who I am anymore.
" Horrible game, after 10 minutes playing I decided to never play again.   1/10  ~IGN"
this game sucks
7.8/10 too much conga
"This game is really good because you can play in many varying ways. As a spy you could be sneaky. If you like to be a support you could always play as a medic and heal injured teammates. If you wanna be a bit tanky, though you will probably need a medic to be in the frontlines of a fight, you could play as a heavy and kill everybody with your minigun. If you like being fast and capture points and the intelligence fast you will be playing as the scout. There's other classes such as sniper, pyro, soldier demoman, and engineer. Another great thing is that you can find new weapons to play differently. Definitely recommend, Hell I would give the game 10/10!"
the new updated ♥♥♥♥ED IT UP IT CRUPET MY FREINDS FILE AND IT IS TRYING TO BE OVERWATCH  Valve scrap the update make another like the last please  but keep the tunts they are bad ♥♥♥
"Just look at my hours. Awesome game, community, and you never get bored.  Joined because my bro showed me random SFM. I tought it was a pay to win, so I never tried it. Now that I have it, it's ruining my life.  10/10"
if you want to waste money then this game is for you :P
Less than average the amount of Russians.  10/10.
it's pretty good i guess there are like hats and stuff y'know  hat/10 would hat agen
"Terrible graphics, super hard to learn how to play well every class, and a cancerous community 100/100 would recommend"
it's a fine game
&gt;Updates TF2  &gt;Plays TF2   &gt;wtf
"Absolute ruin. I started playing this game just as a pastime, hang with a few friends, you know, enjoy myself. It has since morphed into the hideous spawn of Satan and obsession. I have since changed my name, moved to a new state, changed my hair, pretty much gained a new identity to get away from this game. No matter where I went, it found me. It found me and forced me to play it. I cannot stop. Play this game and it will be all you do. 10/10 would play again. Download it. Play it. Live it."
"'s a gud gaim. You get a gun, you shoot people, you learn, you improve. Most importantly, you get hats. Hats are like this game's version of points. Always get hats."
This game killed my social life.
"I don't have many things to say about the game that haven't been said already, and quite frankly, I don't feel like repeating others. Anyways, let's start with an initial presentation of the GAMEPLAY:  Team Fortress 2 is a first-person shooter developed by Valve that uses team-based cooperation heavily in its gameplay, providing 9 different classes that all play a distinct role. The Scout is a lightweight class that is used for flanking and, as such, is most beneficial to be directed through secondary paths, such as to surprise the enemy. The Soldier is an 'average' class that doesn't have many downsides. The versatility it provides makes it a 'swiss maggot knife'. The Pyro is usually devised as a harrassing class, dealing damage with afterburn to weaken the enemies. There's a character limit to the review, so I'll speed it up. The Demoman uses traps to prevent the enemy team from advancing. The Heavy is a sort of 'walking sentry' that acts as a wall between the enemy and the objective, being able to deal tremendous amounts of damage. Well, ♥♥♥♥. I ran out of space, so I leave you all with a warm hug and a friendly goodbye. 10/10 nice game"
"This game is great, It's pretty challenging aswell. Many players in the servers, and spies that look like your teammates, It's a great game. Make sure to install it."

  Team Fortress 2 Review
Who needs life if you've got hats?         11/10
It's kinda fun for the first few minutes
"This game will most likely waste and ruin your time, money, friendships, and/or any communication with life outside the screen, but that's a good thing."
"It's free and it's fun, what more do you want!?"
"This game becomes more and more addictive the more you play it. It has grown on me man, now i can't stop."
This game is by far the best of the best! I truly recommend this game!
Makes me eat bread again 10/10
"team fortess 2 is surprisingly a great game I had doughts at first that it would be a rediculase game because of the hat wearing,strange guns and hats with unusual effects but I thought wrong and now I am addicted to team fortress 2  I recommend =}"
really fun game. best hat simulator in the world.
"10/10 would recommend, once u get an Unusual hat, you can't Stop. Trust me...."
Can't stop.
"This is not really a game, it is more of a simulation of Left Twix factor and Right Twix factory dueling each other to see who has the better twix."
Can teleport bread  11/10

"Whether you like it or not, this game will eat all your money. It says 'free to play' but in reality you will come out with 200 virtual keys and a forclosed upon house."
I paid $20 for this game. Then I paid $60 and countless hours on trade servers to make my guy look cool and shiny.   10/10
It's a cool game with A LOT OF achievements! It's funny! But I'm NOT good at it ;-) 
This game is great for all people who decides to try it out. each of the nine classes a very different from each other and they call for different play styles and moves. I fully recommend this game for anyone and everyone!
"Pretty K, K?"
Its a great game you get addicted to trading easily 1 tip NEVER UNBOX!! :D
"with a game that has so many different play styles, you cant go wrong with playing tf2, theres 9 different classes uniqe wepons and personalitys and so many things you can do with many game modes, 5 stars!"
BEST HAT SIMULATOR
"Kill a guy with the flamethrower without airblasting him: 'You bloody W+M1!' Airblast guy into air, finish him with shotgun: 'You stupid tryhard, just go die'   Join MVM as Heavy, upgrade some stats. 'feral, join another class we have two heavies' Alright, I guess. Switch to Sniper at another players suggesting. 'feral nonono i be sniper' 'Well, you just told me to join another class. 'no i didnt'   Join X10 server with Flying Guillotine, kill a guy with it 'feral hack kick pls'  10/10"
Very fun game! It is a very popular  Free To Play  game on Steam. There are 9 classes to choose from and you can earn items for your inventory. I recommend this to all of you people who like killing games.
At least the best free game on steam.
"&gt;I was only 23 years old. &gt;I loved the gibus so much. &gt;'Gibus is love' I say, 'Gibus is life.' &gt;My Friend hears me and calls me an F2P. &gt;I knew he was just jealous of my devotion to the gibus. &gt;I call him a Tryhard. &gt;He slaps me and sends me to a trade server. &gt;I'm crying now and my Pride hurts. &gt;I feel something touch me. &gt;It's the Gibus. &gt;I'm so happy. &gt;It whispers in my ear; 'Happy Halloween.' &gt;It grabs me with it's powerful, silky arms and puts me on my hand's and knee's. &gt;I'm ready. &gt;I spread my head for the Gibus. &gt;It penetrates my head. &gt;It hurt's so much but I do it for the Gibus. &gt;I can feel my head tearing as my eye's start to water. &gt;I push against it's force. &gt;I want to please the gibus. &gt;It roar's a spooky roar as it place's itself on my head. &gt;My friend walk's in. &gt;The gibus look's him right in the eye and says; 'Boo.' &gt;The gibus leave's through my window. &gt;'Gibus is love,' I say. 'Gibus is life.'"
this game is free unlike obamacare
I killed myself using console commands and got banned for hacking.  20/10
"This game?? It is the best hat simulator created on the face of the earth. No other game will surpasses this games addicting hat simulator play style. The purpose of this game is to show off your hats and collect them, once you download the game you will need to join a server. Once your in it you will need to fight against players with normal hats or flaming or sparkling hats, the latter will be the hardest to defeat. As a new player you will need to use your skills to ' Dominate' a person, when you accomplish this you will receive the legendary ' Gibus' which will help you along the journey to become a Team Fortress pro.  10/10 Best hat simulator will recommend to friends or family"
"A Very, Very Fun Game. So fun that 'Team Fortress will sap your wallet.'"
this game is gud
stupid game ruined my life. 10/10 would do again
"Honestly probably the best free to play game on Steam. The only problem I can see in this game is it's community, traders, squeakers, etc. but I can whole-heartedly say there is no reason you should not get this game."
"Recent updates make me feel sad about putting so much time into a game that was once good. Rest in Pizza, TF2."
"Excellent game. Very balanced gameplay, and although its free, just playing the game and expieriencing the fun makes you want to become premium."
"Oh god, I have wasted so much time on this. Would waste again."
"With all the little gamemodes created by the community, you can never get bored with this game!"
"Dear Newcomers,  This is almost what i consider a MUST PLAY game. This game is one of the most fun Free To Play games I've ever come across. The game can be played completely free and if you are skillfull, you can use the items you get via playing to trade with other players. This is a amazing aspect that allows for anyone, even if you dont have any cash, to earn premium status and have all of the abilities of a premium player. The gameplay is fantastic, you will be one of nine classes each with their own personalities, strenghts, and weaknesses. You will meet other classes that will counter you and ones you will anihallate. Overall this is a amazing game with hundreds of hours of content that is a must play for any FPS fan."
Do not confuse weapon unlocks as paid upgrades. Stock is best a lot of the time.
"new update kinda took away everything I liked about tf2. It's no longer casual, statracking only encourages hacking and I haven't found a balanced server since the update. please bring back valve servers the way they were before, community servers are rarely vanilla and it's the vanilla expieriance that I, and many others, miss wholeheartedly."
"I don't know what the big deal about hats is about, I play this game as a shoe collector simulator. Have you seen my new boots for demo? Damn."
"658 hours of play logged at the moment of this comment, that's 27.4167 days, almost an entire month of my life purely logged in an playing this game. It may destroy you, but you'll bend over, take it willingly and say thankyou when it's done."
Need good teamworks for this game
"A truly Amazing game that never get's old. Once you have found your class and got some basic skill, this game is very VERY fun. One of the best game's I have ever played. AND IT'S FREE. What more could you want?"
"It's a FPS game tagged with 'Hats', 'Hat Simulator and 'Fashion'. What's not to like?"
"This game is fun,cartoon style combat with different items for combat and you can trade to get other things you want."
"Ironically, 'Casual' killed everything casual about this game. Now it's either you play competivie, casual competiive, or play on some terrible 24/7 &lt;insert modded ♥♥♥♥ tier map here&gt; community server. Good job Valve."
You have steam and you're not playing Team Fortress 2. What are you doing with your life?
WORTH THE FAT
"I was hyped for this new update. I was very happy to hear that one of my favourite games was being updated... and with nothing more than COMPETITIVE. BOY I waited weeks for the patch to go live, and after the update came, I was dissapointed. Not by the content, it was fair and good, but ... Casual? Valve removed what we knew as quickplay just to put a new mode 'CASUAL'. You wanna know what casual is? It's Competitive but without the pro players. If you liked to play games to goof around or even 'just kill' or try new weapons, well guess what? Now you can't because this new casual doesn't allows you because of the players trying so hard to complete the game, win, and get useless points.  Valve, what the ♥♥♥♥? You were supposed to bring a new patch that could compete against Overwatch but instead you doomed your old fanbase (because the new fanbase enjoys playing just for points). If Valve doesn't fix this soon, saldy, I'm going to quit (for good) TF2. It's not the same anymore."
I Reccomend This Game Like...IIts Fun And Eh Yea When i Started Watching meet The Pyro I thought He Would be Behind Me With his Flame Thrower And The Song Do You Believe In Magic Quite Funny :) - Your`s Sincerly - Tyler Ocimek -
the game is so awsome and fun i would totallly recommend it 5 stars
It ruined my life and I have no money now. But I have hats. Lots of hats     10/10 -.-'
"One of the best games u can play at steam with absolutely no cost . Go ahead give it a shot , i bet u cant stahp playing it"
Amazing free game 11/10
"Now how I came to get this hat, 'tis very strange and funny Grandfather died and left to me his property and money And when the will it was read out, they told me straight and flat If I would have his money, I must always wear his hat  'Where did you get that hat? Where did you get that tile? Isn't it a nobby one, and just the proper style? I should like to have one Just the same as that!' Where'er I go, they shout 'Hello! Where did you get that hat?'  If I go to the op'ra house, in the op'ra season There's someone sure to shout at me without the slightest reason If I go to a concert hall to have a jolly spree There's someone in the party who is sure to shout at me  'Where did you get that hat? Where did you get that tile? Isn't it a nobby one, and just the proper style? I should like to have one Just the same as that!' Where'er I go, they shout 'Hello! Where did you get that hat?'  At twenty-one I thought I would to my sweetheart get married The people in the neighbourhood had said too long we'd tarried So off to church we went right quick, determined to get wed I had not long been in there, when the parson to me said  'Where did you get that hat? Where did you get that tile? Isn't it a nobby one, and just the proper style? I should like to have one Just the same as that!' Where'er I go, they shout 'Hello! Where did you get that hat?'  I once tried hard to be M.P. but failed to get elected Upon a tub I stood, round which a thousand folks collected And I had dodged the eggs and bricks (which was no easy task) When one man cried, 'A question I the candidate would ask!'   'Where did you get that hat? Where did you get that tile? Isn't it a nobby one, and just the proper style? I should like to have one Just the same as that!' Where'er I go, they shout 'Hello! Where did you get that hat?'  When Colonel South, the millionaire, gave his last garden party I was amongst the guests who had a welcome true and hearty The Prince of Wales was also there, and my heart jumped with glee When I was told the Prince would like to have a word with me  'Where did you get that hat? Where did you get that tile? Isn't it a nobby one, and just the proper style? I should like to have one Just the same as that!' Where'er I go, they shout 'Hello! Where did you get that hat?'  -'Where Did You Get that Hat?' by Stanley Holloway  11/10"
"A very fun and addicting game for all ages. Easy to grasp game-modes along with a very in-depth trading community, keeps the game interesting. I played the game for around 800 hours, and there are still many things to do. I would recommend this game to both beginner and more advanced gamers."
Team Fortress 2 is a Fantastic Game Where The Point of The Game is To Kill Everything That Moves There Are 2 Teams Red and Blue There Are Different Classes and Game Modes  Classes: Scout  Soilder  Pyro  Demoman  Heavy Engineer  Medic Sniper Spy  GameModes: Arena Capture The Flag Control Point King of The Hill Man V.S Machine Payload Payload Race Training Mode And Mod Maps (Saxton Hale etc.)  Each Class Has There Own Ups and Downs  Overall Team Fortress 2 (TF2) Is A Really Great Game For When You Want To Just Have Fun With Your Friends or When You Want To Kill Stuff
"This game is one of the most awesome F2P games on steam. I spent over 35 hours in this awesome game but I don't regret about the time invested in this game as it allows me to use my free time effieciently. So if you are reading it right now, you should start downloading and play it after that. #TeamFortress2"
"Alright, I think I've played this game long enough (1,600+ hours) to provide a fair and objective review of it purely from a technical perspective. Keep in mind that this is a cautionary review, as TF2 will by no means appeal to everyone.  Without further adieu, let's get into it.   PROS:   + Pretty much the smoothest and most satisfying gameplay offered by any FPS. Every class feels vital to securing victory and the controls are extremely fluid, as to be expected in a Valve game. The gameplay nails that 'easy to pick up, hard to master' vibe that keeps me coming back every time; a notable example of this is the seemingly simplistic and straightforward gameplay of the Soldier that is enhanced 10x when you get the hang of rocket jumping.  + Generally speaking, the graphics are pleasing to the eye and the game will run exceptionally well, even on older hardware. With certain tweaks to the game's config files, I get 120+ FPS on almost every map (with the notable exception of the recent Gun Mettle maps, which are suffering from some noticeable performance issues that will probably be patched very soon).   + What seems like a shallow and greedy microtransaction system on the surface actually contains an insane amount of depth and value. Don't like the hats you're wearing? Simply toss a trade request towards somebody wearing a hat that you want and behold the wonder of a bartering based economy. Tired of battle? Simply tap 'G' and dance to your heart's content; with luck, the enemy team will put down their weapons and join you. The silliness and fun that oozes from this game is palpable.  + The community definitely makes this game a gem. If you're bored of the maps that come with the game, simply fire up the server browser and explore a completely community created map. Looking for some great deals or wanting to sell your old junk? There are thousands of servers designed solely for trading at your fingertips. Have you mastered a specific class to the point of dominating everyone on public servers? Fire up your favorite server browser and play with people of equivalent skill in competitive matches.  + You can kill people with ham and a frying pan. Let that sink in.   CONS:   - The game has a habit of being abandoned by Valve for prolonged periods of time, starving the community of much needed updates. A recent example of this was the vacuum of time between the Christmas 2014 update and the Gun Mettle update, the latter being released a couple weeks ago. That's nearly  SEVEN MONTHS  of the game existing without any major updates, which is curious given how popular it still is.  - Some maps, especially the ones made by the community and later added to the official roster by Valve, have some glaring glitches and technical issues that have still not been fixed. A great example of this is koth_suijin, a map shipped with Gun Mettle, that causes HUGE FPS drops even for players with powerful rigs.  - Major balance issues tend to pop up from time to time. The Loch n' Load, an alternative to the Demoman's primary weapon, was completely and totally overpowered for months upon months with no sign of Valve nerfing it until the aforementioned Gun Mettle update. Be wary of players exploiting these balance issues and playing with loadouts that are totally broken and difficult to counter.    FINAL SCORE: 8/10   If you like shooting things, play this game. Yes, there are issues, but the amount of fun and depth that this game exudes definitely compensates for it. I've spent 1600 hours in the world of TF2, and I couldn't be happier about it."
"A really thrilling fun first person shooter game with new weapons and other cool hats.You can buy hats, weapons, misc, and badges.highly reccomend you try this game out. :)"
"Do you have a nice looking or expensive hat? No? Well don't expect any ubers, help, or even friends. ♥♥♥♥ you man just stop being a ♥♥♥♥♥ and waste real money on hats to be cool on the internet."
"Team Fortress 2, A marvel amoung games, Where gamers around the world come together to stab, burn, bludgen and shoot other people for no good reason. TF2 for me is like Christmas every day, it is fun, enjoyable and you get free stuff. It is one of those games that if it wasn't made life would be some much different, It would be like no Christmas, Easter or even your Birthday. So Yeah play it. Rating 10/10"
Not worth 853.4 hours.
"It's a colorful, immersing game. Very fun!"
"Well, a few guys started to dance conga. They said to press G, so I started to dance too. But I didn't know what to do to stop dancing and decided to go on. And while I was dancing, some guy ♥♥♥♥ed up me with a guitar.   10/10. Would dance again."
This game is awesome and fun....thats pretty much it. I never really play FPS' but I made an exception for this one.
"I would have written a positive review for Team Fortress 2 when it was in its hay day (about 4-5 years ago). Unfortunately, this game is far past its shelf life. I, personally, am completely against the free-to-play business model in videogames, which overall benefits the company more than the player. TF2's shift to free-to-play was not a welcome one in my eyes, and it was too bad I couldn't receive a refund for it. Regardless, TF2 doesn't necessarily punish players for not paying for weapons and cosmetics - but when I see more store content than actual meaningful gameplay changes or additions, I begin to get suspicious... and eventually frustrated.  As TF2 ages and the fanbase further disperses to spending their funds elsewhere, I predict TF2 will continue on this downward slide into more f2p purchases and less actual content. Simply put: its current state is 'meh', and it will get progressively worse. I'd recommend not investing in this game."
Fun and chaotic. Not your generic fps multiplayer.
That game was good when TEAMWORK existed.....all i see at lots of servers is selfishness and etc but forgetting that is a ALMOST PERFECT game
Its good
This game is good
An Awesome Game With Awesome people who play it ::::) 10/10
"There's enough different classes, weapons, cosmetics and maps/objectives to keep the game fun and interesting for a long time, and it's always fun to play with friends."

chaos. absolute ♥♥♥♥ing chaos
"In all aspects, my very hard headed head, was that i would hate this game. But after I was harassed by a friend, I joined the steam community, downloaded TF2 as my first game, and thus, an addiction started!  Update 5-8-2016  Stil playing the game, and tons of trading and ♥♥♥♥! Mannnn up!"
TF2 = Hats Shall I say more?
"The best game i every played. What makes it stand out? It's all animated. Most shooting games make the graphics look just like real life. But Team Fortress 2 is full on animations and also...hats! There are lots of hats in the Team Fortress 2 universe to find, buy and trade. Many types of gameplays if you ever get bored of one and if there's no one on the server, you can play offline practice with bots!  My favorite game to play everyday :D"
You work as a team  you protect a fortress  and there's 2 teams  Team Fortress 2  but really its a fun game   and a hat simulator.......
"Someone obliterated me with a rocket launcher, becoming my nemesis. Beat my nemesis to death with a fish. He then dominated me again with a frying pan. So I threw a jar of urine at him and headshotted him with a bow and arrow. Then he stabbed me in the back with an ice pick and froze my corpse. So I set him on fire with a gun that fires rainbows. We became best friends, then spent the rest of the round doing the Conga.  11/10 would conga again."
"Disclaimer:This review was written on July 13,2016, so if the problems is fixed and i never get back to editing this review to make it positive, dont yell at me about it. remember, this is MY OPINION.  I do not know when, but valve has claimed they will fix this problem. 7 months later i see almost no progress.  Ever since this new update Heavy VS Pyro, game waiting times have increased to you having to wait over an hour for a 12v12 game to be formed. My childhood friend can only play MVM due to reasons that i shall not state, and that takes forever to put me in a server of 6 people, waiting times are outrageous! and as soon as i get in it comes to nothing because this stupid ''Game in Progress Found,Rejoin?'' thing pops up, and when i rejoin it sends me to the same server! The only other option is leave, which disconnects me from the server. i cant talk or anything to my teammates about it, and it goes in this endless cycle, Mann vs machine is VIRTUALLY UNPLAYABLE! Valve claims they will fix this, and i see no progress over the last 7 months, and now i have to wait hours for me to be put in a server because the searches are the slowest thing ever Fun game and all, very high prices, i mean, who pays 13 US$ for a ballonicorn that makes you visit pyroland when you can wear Pyrovision glasses from an achievement to do the same thing?! Hats and taunts are way too expensive too, and i request that they fix these games! this Astonishing and fun game has now become an Idiotic Waiting Cycle Simulator in which Valve dosen't care about. I may get rid of this review and write a new one if valve manages to fix the MVM problem, but for now this is just a Waiting Simulator 2016."
"Team Fortress 2 is an amazing, if not, best, teamwork-oriented FPS. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves either team work, first-person shooters, or having a good laugh."
THE BEST GAME EVER
"10/10 would conga again  '10 out of 10, now when do i get paid again?'-IGN"
"Best free,multiplayer fun you will EVER have... "
Best Free to Play Game :D 10/10
My review for TF2... I am 38 and still playing it. My son is now playing it. After all these years there is still new stuff coming out and it's one of the best known games on the planet! What else do you want me to say? This game is History!
"Valve did deir bezt ( After 9 years in Dev, hopefully it would have been worth the weigh ~Gabe Newell ) The cartoon-ish art, players makes it one of the best FPS I have ever played. Although the community might be rubbish, there are still player out there who plays the game for what it is. Still, it's worthwhile playing it."
"First game i played on steam. And after over 1,000 hours of playing it, i still come back for more."
"mmph mmph mmmphh mm mmmmph mmph mmp mmph mm mmm mmph mmph!!   This game is seriously, amazing. I've met lots of cool friends on it and had many hours of fun. I totally recommend this game to anyone and everyone. :)  "
"I wish this game was more popular, I've been playing for 4 years and still haven't gotten tired of it. Jump in, shoot people, get shot at. Simple fun"
"It has hats,It has fish bats,It has Gay porn. Conga hat/10"
this game is awesome i m addicted of this game
That's Cool I love it!
One of the best games I have ever played on my computer.
Love it. Good people. Great community.  Pros.  Almost everyone ones it HATS Friendly community Cons Keys Keys Keys Money Gaben 10/10 would waste money on this game again
"Everybody should know what Hat Fortress 2 is. THE HATS DON'T DO ANYTHING. STOP OBSESSING OVER THEM.  There, that's out of my system now."
A great game that became even more so great when it became FTP. Why do you not own this game already if you don't? All the guns and hats you could ever want await you in the magical world of TF2!
This game is super fun i would play this for has long as i can try gamemode like freak fortress 2 and slender fortress 2
This game has been my favorite game for the past 2 years and I hope it stays awesome and it keeps getting more updates.
10/10 Raging children
"  is good gme  y good? 1. very meme 2. fun gud game 3. phlog  3. is best not op, just gud"
Love this game. Definitely buying a headset has made it more social experience. If you get past some of the asses that just like to agitate people thre are some gresat peeps to intereact with.
Lost all of my real friends.  Lost several hours of my life.
10/10 Lots of pootis.
I really like this game with all it's game modes and it's HATS (Stay fancy my friends :3)
"TF2 has always been my favorite game ever, and if you're trying it for the first time, be pacient because Team Fortress 2 is a class-based shooter game like no other."
"Tom Clancy's Team Fortress 2 takes us deep inside the thrilling world of international espionage, where sinister decisions that affect the future of every living soul on the planet are brokered in dark rooms thick with smoke and tension so thick, it chokes. The tagline reads 'The most fun you can have online', but can anyone truly enjoy themselves when faced with these impossible decisions? What is in the intelligence briefcase? Is it worth murder? Where shall we go for lunch? I urge you to avoid this game entirely. Thank you."
"10/10, wasted hundreds of dollars and lost hordes of proffit, i am now a bankruped hobo on the street, but at least i look good...right?"
"It's free. And if this wouldn't be enough of a reason to have it downloaded and installed on your hard drive already, it's also fun. And not only fun. Thi- OMG ♥♥♥♥ING NOOB PYRO'S KILLING ME AGAIN, ♥♥♥♥ THIS ♥♥♥♥!!!!!!11"
"I can kill people with pans, cameras, candy canes, swords, neon signs, whips, bats, postboxes, baseballs, christmas decorations, crossbows, compound bows, mutant bread mittens, boxing gloves, knives, needle guns, flare guns, car batterys on sticks, laser guns, wrenches and cannonballs in a single game. It's enough to resolve any fetishes, suppressed or anger issues that ANYONE has."
Hey guys this is an awesome game!
"This game is free. It has Hats. It has Guns. This game is free, and has hats, and has Guns. Did I mention it's free and has hats and guns and guns and hats and frees and games and mentions and has hases and has ands and hats and hats and guns and hats and guns and frees? If it did not mention that fact, then I need to tell you that it has Hats and Guns.  Hats and Guns/10        But I do digress, the latest updates have made the game exponentially laggier, to the point where having fun isn't an option. It was fine before. Dang it, Valve."
Men who accessorize is what this has become.
"700 hours must mean something, the free game which I have played more than any other game... ever..."
"very good game, loads of action to keep you entertained for HOURS, YES HOURS"
Wasted 1000 hours of my life on it and also I got bad grades because of it no problem to be had here get it now maggots
Hats are good and amazing. 10/10 one of the best games out there.
Fun AND free. Its a win win
Ruined my life.
Awesome Game. It is easy to learn and play. The funnest FREE game you will ever play on PC
This game is awesome I give 5 stars
best dress up game I ever played
"Two words: Get This, It's free, it's fun it's f*cking awesome all it costs is diskspace and once you've mastered all the classes and shooting and weapons and stuff. Then I have two more words for you: Get pimped.  Yes. Pimped. There are way more hats than weapons so once you evolve from nooby-F2P-ness. Either turn your crappy old duplicates and unwanted weapons into scrap (the currency of TF2) and craft or buy hats (or you could use real money at the Mann Co store but that's lame) This game is the definition of never-ending awesome."
"thx 2 team fortres 2, i can now finaly do 360 yoloshots. thx valve :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD"
"Team Fortress 2 is a simply phenomenal title if you're looking for a Free to Play First Person Shooter. It has nine classes which are distinctly different in how they look and play, and there are dozens upon dozens of weapons you can unlock either through simply playing the game and getting free drops, crafting them, earning certain items through achievements, or trading other players for them. These unlocks can further change the way you play a class allowing for even more variety. One class has the ability to be a bomb wielding maniac, or use a magic, head collecting sword and shield to slice off heads. There are 50 official maps, and 10 different game modes.  Variety is the spice of life, and Team Fortress 2 certainly has variety. It can be daunting to get into considering just how much there is to learn, but it's worth the investment."
Amazing Game! My fav game so far on steam! I rate 10/10 :D
"Well, congratulations Steam. Having played this game off-and-on for six years, and just recently having gotten back into it, you've destroyed this game. The days of just open the game, choosing a mode, and playing are over. I've been sitting here staring at the Matchmaking screen for an hour, and I can't just choose one mode to play.  TF2 was first and foremost a casual game. You join a game, shoot some people, capture some intel, and go about your day. Now, it's figuratively (And in my case, aparently literally) an unplayable mess.  Good job, you killed my favorite casual FPS."
Install Steam. Install this. Never install any other game. Buy Hats. Kill anyone with a Brony or Homestuck username. Barter with other players for items they JUST got in the middle of a match and treat Scrap Metal like crack-rocks. Sell your worldly possessions for hats. Have you tried Mann Vs Machine yet? That's a good way to spend money too. Look at all that money you've spent on a Free-To-Play. At least you aren't playing League Of Legends. Also something about Pootis. I have over fifty hours put into this game and I am still no good at it.  I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game.
Ive had this game since 2008 and its still by far my favourite game. Try it!
hats
"When I was growing up in the white trash apartment complex in the 90s, I often spent my days playing outside. I would catch toads, fish, and bugs and often keep them as pets. One day my mother burned my face with a cigar.  A few years ago my brother and I were fishing. We caught a catfish and as we were cleaning and gutting it, we noticed a pair of human infant feet in the catfish's stomach contents.   More importantly, this taught me a valuable lesson about not running on floors covered in ice or human excrement."
"Team Fortress 2 is a fun game but it was better before Meet your Match Update. Everytime I see the Casual competitve, i think about the good old times in pubs where you simply have fun destroying everyone on the other team.Those times where you could go (or get forced) to the other team to make it balanced.  That were good old times : Now we have Waiting Simulator 2016 and Tryhards and 90% of the community servers are worse or simply are empty. Also don't want to be reminded of the REAL competitive : yet more tryhard , less players  (6v6 pls) , no fun.  Long story short : Bring bloody pubs back !  P.S TF2 is still the best Hat Simulator out there  Update 07.08.2016: Mannpower is somewhat littered with aimbotters.Play Mannpower on your own risk! (It might be not every match though)"
"play this, is gud delz"
"So, wanna know why this is better than Call Of Duty?  1. It's free 2. Who cares about logic? YOU CAN FLY! 3. Headshots on everything are too over powered. 4. Not a killer? No problem! Play medic and let your pocket mercenary cover you or just get into trading! 5. Still wanna spend money and play? Might as well buy Mann Co. Keys and use them to trade!  There you go. My top five reasons to throw CoD Ghosts out the window. And play Team Fortress 2.  (6. Charity matters. CoD doesn't give a **** about charity. Team Fortress 2 does. Just search 'Tip of the Hats'."
"7gb of hats. TF2,such a wonderful game."
"This game is unfathomably good. I don't even like first-person shooters, and not only do I still like TF2, it's actively my favourite game of all time. There are 9 classes, each with different playstyles, and each with a bunch of different weapons you can use to fine-tune the class to how you want to play. It's impressive how balanced the game is - each weapon has benefits and drawbacks compared to the stock weapons you have when you first start the game. There are a few whose benefits outweigh the drawbacks and vice-versa, and a couple that are literally direct upgrades, but you never feel like you're at a huge disadvantage by not having certain weapons.   The fact that the game's around 7 years old and they're still updating it is incredible. The Mann vs. Machine update added a new game mode that's a sort of tower defence game. It could have been its own $20-$30 game, but nope, Valve gave it to everyone for free. There are some advantages premium players have over free players, but none of them directly affect gameplay - Premium players can keep more items and trade. Trading makes it so easy to get weapons and Premium can cost less than a dollar, so I really don't see any reason to not upgrade yourself to Premium.  I guess at some point I have to talk about hats. They seem silly, right? Why bother making so much of the content have no effect on gameplay? But that's exactly why they do it! A new weapon isn't just about modelling and scripting. You have to make sure it's balanced and can't be exploited in any way. But hats and other cosmetic items can't possibly be 'unbalanced', so of course they can add a hundred hats easier than they can add one new weapon. Maybe they could focus more on weapons, but there are already so many as it is; you don't want to make it impossible for new players to catch up.  So obviously TF2 is amazing. 10/10 would play again and probably will this afternoon.  There are, however, a few drawbacks. TF2's normal devotion to balance makes it all the more glaring when something isn't balanced. The Soldier has so much versatility in his weapons that it's pretty easy to call him /the best class/ in a game that's supposed to be about teamwork. It's pretty easy to see Valve playing favourites with the Soldier. If some class has a weapon that players are favouring over the other options, most of the time Valve will nerf the over-used weapon (ex. the Spy's Dead Ringer). But for the Soldier, they'll just buff the under-used weapons (ex. The Concheror and Battalion's Backup). Giving the Soldier extra upgrades in Mann vs. Machine also reeked of favouritism when it's the Spy and Pyro who needed the help.  One other drawback is that the store's prices on weapons has absolutely nothing to do with how rare / common they are. This isn't really Valve's fault, but it makes a lot of things in the store complete rip-offs. Suppose you want a Phlogistinator. It costs $10 in the store. OR you could buy four Keys ($2.50 each). Each key is worth, in the trading economy, about 100 Phlogistinators. I'm not exaggerating. (Phlogistinator: 0.05 - 0.11 refined. Key: about 8.66 refined.)  Basically, once you know a little bit about the economy, you feel like you have to REALLY get into it so you don't get ripped off. Or maybe that was just me."
"This game takes a lot of getting used to compared to other First Person Shooters, but it's definitely fun when you get used to it. It has all kinds of different play styles from stealth to fortification to guns blazing. This game fills any kind of need you have with so many different weapon combinations to choose from. If you're not feeling the fight, this game also offers a wide variety of hats and taunts to have fun with."
10/10
TF2 is a fun competitive game that I enjoy playing time to time.
Its pretty cool.
I got assassinated by myself.  10/10
Why And How That My Friend Is Lv 200 Then It Goes down to 1?And Never Going Up?Fix It Damn
cod is better than this dumb game
Great game!
"Used to love the game,played it so many hours but not anymore today's update spoiled the game old UI is 1000 times better thaan the new one,servers are not connecting keep searching even for casual play"
New update XD  Pay to play or ♥♥♥♥ off XD
Rip pubs  Also $10 for MM pass when it should be free?
I love this game very much!!
You can put the Heavy in a tutu.
10/10 best game since conga update.
"This game is probably one of the best FPS games I have ever played. It includes 9 different classes with their own personality. Like the Scout, he likes baseball and can strangely double jump. He's incredibly fast, which makes him a good add-on to the Offensive classes. Team Fortress 2 is Free To Play now, so everyone (including Gibus wearers) can enjoy the fun... probably. I'm not that 'ermg it haz goats 10/10' guy. Overall, my rating is 9.8/10."
It made me horny. I even made a porno of Spy and Soldier.
"This game... Oh gods this game. 'Oh, you only have nine classes? And you don't even get unlocks that are better than beginner weapons? What reason is there to play?!' Words can not lend this game justice. That 7.5GB that was spent downloading this game? It was definitely put to good use. You see other people playing and it's all; 'This game is sh**' But when you actually play it, you don't even notice the minutes tick by. It's like a hypnosis-machine, but with more gun. The only gripe I can really give to this game is that it uses a  lot  of internet data. Then again, what good online game doesn't? Aaargh, I couldn't encourage you to download this game any more than I am now. If you can only barely spare the 7.5GB download, trust me. Download TF2. You WILL love it.   Except for those dumbasses who spam the microphone with some dumbass song =w= "
It's one of the best games I played and the best part is it's free (tip: try to keep your wallet away from hats or it will be the most expensive game u ever played :D)
"Graphics : 9/10 It's kinda realistic even with pyrovision with the funny silly gibs  Gameplay : 7/10 In the release of the Conga Line i am aware that the conga rules over the map  In-Game Items? : 8/10 Yeah,pretty much unusuals,hats,weapons,etc. can be traded  Recommended 8/10"
"this game is amazing because of its free to play style and design, end of story. If you are still considering downloading this game just do it already because it's definitely a great game. The game itself revolves around a unique 'class' system, each class having his own very distinct personality and play style. This is one of the reasons I fell in love with this game to begin with. The skill cap is endless and you will have many wonderful hours playing the core game. Another great aspect of this game is the economy and cosmetic systems, sure they will drive you crazy sometimes, but that's part of the TF2 experience. If you are new, that's all you really need to know to convince you to download, SO DO IT. However, if you are a veteran player or simply want to fully learn my current opinion on the game, then I encourage you to keep reading. :)  With all that said, after around 100 hours, currently, I can imagine new players beginning to become bored of the features present. To be honest, the game has not received the same amount of attentioj as it has in the past, with fewer updates that made me want to really continue playing. As a player of the competitive beta player, I can safely say that adding competitive would be a breath of fresh air into the game by focusing on the more serious, veteran players as well as catering to the everyday casual gamer. I can honestly recommend the competitive mode because of the whole new experience it offers from normal pub matches. Players are helpful and with a good team working together, you can have some of your best games in it. However, with the 2016 summer update quickly closing in I strongly hope that Valve takes a good amount of time and effort to add and change things thier loyal community has been waiting for. This is because as much as I would like to believe so, I don't think comp will take the game as far as it has come, without additional strong content, especially with uprising compitition in the genre. I would love to see this game grow and strive as it has been for the past few years and I know many players will agree. If you read through all of this then CONGRATS, now what are you still doing here??? GO DOWNLOAD IT ALREADY! :)"
"TF2 is a crazy FPS where you can battle friends and kill them in one foul swoop with a frying pan, make a fat man look like dovakihn, make a one-eyed black scottish man jump across the map and drink a grenade, laugh over your bff's corpse, have a burning Top-hat, kill people with bubbles, get hats, and more hats, and more hats, and more hats, and more hats, DON'T YOU GET IT YET?

Probobly one of the best games i've palyed.Runs amazingly on my laptop even though its not good at playing games! 9/10
Do you think that 1300 hours is a lot for a game ? For TF2 this is the player's average.  10/10 would this game ruin my relationship again
"one of the better animal crossinglikes on this web zone. this, much like killing floor, features a bit out-of-place shooter element but the customization options are incredible. would recommend to fellow crossers"
"Whipped a 10 year old kid to death while dressed as Santa, then blew up his friend and didn't get arrested 10/10."
"This is a great game, it's balanced and Valve listens to it's community, it has an active trade community and has been going on for 7 years now! wow."
Its a good game
Very nice and competitive game
It is such a fun game. Recommended to all!
"Excellent game, the gameplay is awesome, the graphics are beautiful and it's free to play! I would recommand this to everyone."
This game is called team fortress 2 its about helping each other to win also there are 9 classes for you to choose from like the scout medic heavy spy pyro enginner sniper soldier and demoman and there are two diffrent teams red and blu and you both have to kill each person on oppisite teams and you will also get hats and weapons so if you ever are board and want to like play a game that you can kill people then i guess team fortress 2 is the right game for you so if you have any more questions and come and ask me so ya bye and have fun there are more stuff coming on the way
"this game is the best free to play fps. there is alot of teamwork and decision making in this game. there is alot of different play styiles and its amazing how much creativity it has. the only thing i have wrong with it is new items. all they have is reskins, and dont get me wrong they ae amazing but they cost a crap ton of money to get a decent one. but over all gameplay is amazing! :)"
"fast spaced fps with lotsa gimmicks tho it takes a lot of time to get okay at it (bout idk 800 hours, 50 hours on each class). lotsa customization options, lotsa updates each year. very good game, still rocks in 2015"
"I take back what I said about this game. It is fun on occasions, but its just the spys man, they are so annoying, you can't get a break on this game. I don't play this as much but if you are into difficult, funny, unique and creative multiplayer gaming, then this is the game for you. 8/10"
"Team fortress 2. Great Game So far.  So back when i was new in Steam. I was F2P, Level 0. Looking for free game. And i founded this. After 300+ Hours of playing. I know this is greatest game i ever played! Nice Gameplay, Community, And...Hats.  Anyway lads, I recommend this game."
"Once you start playing, I can assure you your virginity will be forever intact. 10/10 would feel secure knowing my virginity is safe again."
"Perhaps my favorite game, the large community and great moddability make this a great game in my opinion. With both official and community servers (often running custom maps and plugins), you can spend your time blowing things up as a Demoman, or just run around a trade map showing off your cosmetics. Either way, it's an interesting game, and there's nothing quite like it."
"grass grows, birds fly, sun shines, and brother i will dominate you and i ain't even wearing a hat. tf2 is an awesome game why? hat's weapons and misc items that make a call of duty fps look stale. the gameplay is different then call of duty and will take time to get used to but man i have never seen a black scottishs cyclops flying through the air like a bird or a sentry that can not be destroyed. a man who is your worst nightmare who can't be detected by your team and a sniper who will one hit kill you if your not lucky. i like it atleast i ain't being kicked off a server for being new to a game i bought with my money. who the hell cares if it's cartoony or has a stupid concept. it's pure stupid genius it's origns story is funny as can be and who can't resist blasting them robots away with and uber charge?   9/10 because it's training program is too short for new players who deserve to know how to play all classes not four and there are scamers out there so remember it's steamcommunity not staemcommuity or anything like that so i wish you good luck and keep an eye out for spys, engies, scouts, snipers, medics, heavys, pyros, soldiers, demos, and spys, haaaaavvve fun!"
"It's a very ggod game, If you love funny guy (or girl). I love this game because its have more fun than Cs, Cod, and something like that."
"Lately the new updates have been weird but all in all, the gameplay is still as good as I remember from back when I first started playing the game. If you are new to steam I recommend Team Fortress 2."
"What can i say about this game? Well, for one it is a great game. It is well thought out, with 9 classes it is a unique experience compared to other FPS games. You don't just use a machine guns and kill everyone you see. You can build a sentry gun, backstab your enemys, smack a ball to your opponenets face etc. With the vast amount of weapons and achievements you'll be busy and hooked on this game. For it is a task to master using all 9 classes and familiarising yourself with the gamemodes and the unique Mann Vs. Machine. If you ever get curious try it out, i assure you that you will enjoy this game."
""
I Mean the resent update was a failure but it was a good update but i have high hopes for tf2
"-Great game -plenty of fun -HEAPS of different things to do -fav game -reccomend it -love it  And, it better win an award or else TF2 really is dead... I think"
10/10 TF2 made by China
Definitely one of the best class-based shooter's I've played. It has a great community with tons of different usermade levels and gamemodes.
quite fun however valve just doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about their games
Awesome game! Especially as it's free! 
"So basically you get to choose 9 diffrent classes the Scout, Sloider, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy. The Scout, Sloider, and Pyro are on offense. The Demoman, Heavy, and Engineer are on defense. The Medic, Sniper and Spy are on Support. The Scout can double-jump, The Sloider can rocket jump, The Pryo can air-blast enemies, The Demoman can sticky jump, The Heavy mows down everything in sight, The Engineer can biuld a sentry, dispenser, and a teleporter, The Medic heals people has they call for him, the Sniper can spot Spies with Jarate, and The Spy has a butterflyknife and also has an invisiwatch, with a sapper, and a disguise kit. You will get random item drops when playing the game, there is a shop which means you uses your money to buy hats and items. There is also Man V.S. Machine (MvM) where you have two opitions Boot Camp which doesn't require a Tour of Duty Ticket, and there Mann Up which requires a Tour Of Duty (ToD) Ticket. You'll be paired up with 6 other players and there is a series of missions that you can complete and earn rare itms that you can olny get though MvM. With the competitive side of TF2 now avaliable to everyone you get to participate in 6v6 or 9v9, also there is now casual and community options to select from. You can also unbox crates you find and unlock by buying a Mann Co. Supply Crate Key. The Crates you find all have a strange quallity to it, the more kills you get, the higher the ranks get. Sometimes you might be lucky to unbox a hat, or unbox an UNUSUAL hat with a awesome effect to it! Best part about TF2 that its....wait for it... FREE to play! What are you waiting for??? GO get TF2 today! Rating: 10/10. The mariomaster101 Approves!"
"So this is going to be 'that' type of review. Since I started playing this game 2-3 years ago I've managed to gather almost 700 Hours so I'd say my knowledge of this game should be just about right. As a fairly-simple designed game it managed to attract a wide range of players that build an amazing community, although some people say that it's 'dead'. This is what most TF2 fans told themselves before 'The Competitive Update'. Ow yea! You've a hard time mentaining a game and you decide to make things even more complicated than they already are! How stunning ! Bring a new feature to the table to make people excited: 'People that have waited this for years ! It has to work!', well sure because it wouldn't fail to make the game more FUN and INTERACTIVE now. Of course people won't mind us not having Tutorials or 'the nerf hammer' hitting every unique and interesting item every time someone finds out it's OP, so why would they mind us making everything 2 times more complicated with this new match-making.  Veterans used to learn the game mecanics by themselves since there is no other way of learning to play this game. You would think: 'Hey after 9 years in development you can't find a better way to teach players to play than to learn things themselves', but still, changing the weapons stats on regular bases seems easy to understand and keep up with. But hey! At least I can dance Conga wearing a sombrero or pretend that I'm a crab! Fun mecanics? What are those? I can be a crab! A FREAKING CRAB!!! 10/10 Would crab again"
Volvo ruined my favorite game :( MYM was the nail in the coffin
I really recommend this game it's so great! 
"Hey, thats pretty good."
this should be your first game on steam.
really awesome game!! would recommend
This game is funny just try it.
"TF2 is a great experience. Mostly in custom servers/maps. I don't recommend the regular gameplay. Like 2fort/dustblowl/etc. But i do recommend custom maps/trade/achievement/silly/fun servers. Because this game has A lot of potential to screw around and have fun. It can be really fun in servers that have no forced goal or time limit. You can create your own goals, and objectives. And have your own fun. Whichever that case may be. The competitive players really ruin the game. A.K.A  Tryhards . This game..  ' ALL ' games . are about fun.. Not winning... Winning dosen't matter.. Making your  ' MARK '  does matter... I've known that since i was very young.. This game can remain fun for many years if you learn the skills and exploits of it. It can be amazing even... I have no words in any language that express what i have to get out for what's next... I wish i could say it... But there are no words yet.. It's too complex of a topic and/or emotion to convey.. TF2 is a work of  ' ART '  And i appreciate the potential that this masterpiece can deliver.. Thanks Valve.. You may have made some mistakes.. There may be too many flaws to count in certain areas.. But here's something many of us are ashamed to admit.. 'We are only human... We all have our flaws... No one is equal.. We are all unique and imperfect.. Perfection does not exist though... So be proud for the level of greatness that we CAN acheive.. The  ' MARK '  we  ' CAN '  make... The  ' THINGS '  We leave behind for Future Generations... And many things to say that i can't explain in words... But i know some of you may truly feel it deep inside...' - ♫Joe (USA)♫"
"Despite the not so satisfying updates, the TF Community has endured so long.It has faced many ripoff versions of it like Block n Load and Overwatch,but has still stood firm, ready to take on future opponents in the class-based FPS industry.A game that is 70000 players strong,TF2 will definitely last for a long time.                Best hat sim ever"
This is a good game if you like bad games.
"The new matchmaking has ruined the game, you can no longer even join your friends mid game..."
"Its just amazing, even though the last couple of months have been a rough road for the TF2 Community, im glad this game is still awesome, and has been since its debut in the 'Orange Box.' If your looking for something casual or something fun and competitive, i recommend this game for you!"
Its a funny game but valve messed with some community-server changes...  Nice game but bad community-server restrictions from valve. :/
Used to be a great game but bad updates ruined it.
Easily the greatest multiplayer team shooter ever made and it only gets better and better with time.
"Best game ever, people should get this game.Even after years of it being released, its still quite fun with the custom game mode made by other players like Death Run and Jailbreak."
Still the best Team based Online First Person Hat Simulator to date. ;3
This game helped me find who I really am : A selfish tryhard who only cares about himself and kills friendlies when they don't have hats. 10/10
This game is awesome!
"I can't even begin how to explain how fun this game is. If you wanted to play with bots, there's that option, but for the REAL fun, play online. It's extremely fun. 10/10 for sure."
"9.5/10 If you've been in a cave for the last 7 years, then you may have not heard of a 'Little' game called TF2. TF2 is a class-based FPS, i. e. different characters and loadouts. TF2 strays away from the militaristic style of TF1, and adds a breath of fresh air to the FPS industry, unlike the MONOTONOUS BLACK OPS S- Oops, did I get ahead of myself. The gameplay is so unique, you'll be hooked for life. Every single weapon is different. From rocket launchers to shotguns to pistols to soda to conch shells to lasers to exploding cannon balls - whew. The beauty of this game lies in its totally unique item system. You can acquire items by playing the game, buying them (Hey, they gotta make a profit), or by crafting them. Weapons are used to put up a fight, hats are hard to acquire, but are worth a lot and can make you look like a boss, and tools can be used for various purposes, like opening crates or spreading keys. However, it is F2P, but in a good way. The people who buy the stuff have no clear advantage over the F2Pers. The best part of the game is the classes. They all are different and unique. Take the Soldier. Soldier is your one man army, armed with a RPG, a shotgun, and a shovel, although like all classes, this can be changed. He is a steryotypical crazed patriot from the midwest, and is smart as a pecan. (Not smart). There's also a co-op mode against robots, literal robots who run on piles of money, and the game's fan base can create content on GMOD, increasing the media for this game. One major thing that iffs me is that some things you can unbox from Mann Co Supply Crates (A gimmick for you to buy keys to get a mystery prize) are not even worth how much the key was worth. Stranges and strange parts are sometimes looked down on in the community. Other then that, it's great. "
"By far the best free to play games out there, and game in general you will probably ever play I highly recommend this for anyone one looking for a good, free, and fun game, this game has become a classic, and will always be one of my favorite games, A warning though this game is f2p, but you may find yourself emptying your wallet on digital hats :D. The game constantly has amazing updates! Which is one of the reason its community is growing, and has been for 7 years so far!"
"Now, to start off, this game is a dress up simulator and what not, But its still a great game dont get me wrong, it keeps you playing by rewarding you with new weapons and hats ( which we all love) which we use to craft scrap, reclaimed, refined, etc. God, I can go on forever talking about this game, but i'll let you go play yourself because its FREE!"
Nothing to say. Father of all free-to-play shooters. 8/10
"  -Quick Review-    Oh goodness, I haven't reviewed Team Fortress 2 yet?  Designed by Valve Corporation in 2007 but never really lost popularity, Team Fortress 2 is a First Person Shooter which embraces it's cartoon design to such an extreme that it's comical. There are community events, guilds/clans that are dedicated to playing, tons of achievements to earn, Nine different Classes; Team Fortress 2 is fun to play causally or if you really get sucked into the game you can spend many hours playing it.    -Detailed breakdown review-    Story:  The story is the same every game:   It's Red Vs Blue  . If you'd like more 'story' I'd recommend watching all the 'Meet the ______' Class videos, the Spy, Pyro, Heavy.... who am I kidding, each class video is hilarious and you should watch them anyway.   Game Play:  There are Nine Classes; Scout, Soldiers, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy. Each class has its own unique play style, if you want to know more there are plenty of guides out there to explain how to play each one respectively, and doesn't have a place in this review. The game controls and plays like a First Person Shooter, you have different weapons based on your class, you always have: A Melee weapon, A primary and secondary Gun/weapon  (which you can change in your 'loadout') , then some accessories to make your character look unique/different/stupid/funny/ugly/annoying/crazy. One final thing worth note, is that this game never seems to go 'out of style', until there's a Team Fortress 3 (which we all know Valve can't count that high) Team Fortress 2 has stayed one of the top  10 games played on steam  since the time I got my steam account until today (05/23/15) Currently there are 79,860 people playing it, and it's not even peak time.   Achievements:  Team Fortress 2 has 513 Achievements, there are achievements for specific levels/matches, each Class, and certain community events (Halloween, Christmas, etc) . There are many achievements, I haven't seen anyone that has earned them all legitimately. (Many people hack their achievements to get unlockables)   Price:  Team Fortress 2 is now Free to play, they've made so much money on hats that everyone can have the game for free, but need to buy hats. This was one of the first games I had on my steam account, I purchased the Orange Box and got this game with that purchase. Since it's Free to play, you can certainly try this game whenever you'd like, but there's a good chance you already know if you want to play it or not. Thanks for taking the time to read my review anyway. :P   Conclusion:  I recommend this game for pretty much anyone, not everyone will latch onto the game and play it for thousands of hours, but many will at least get 10 hours of entertainment out of the game. However, beware the allure of Team Hat Fortress 2...

My favorite class is the spy...
"how can i say its bad game while i played 3,500 hours.. best game ever!"
"TF2.  A cartoon murder machine where the only goal is to kill all the other cartoon murder machines. Unless you have to carry a briefcase from A to B. Or guard a bomb so it can blow up in their base. There's also capturing giant metal disks on the ground. Y'know what, now that i think about it. There is no game mode where you just run around killing everyone else.  1/1 W+M1  Don't play the map hightower though, you'll get kicked for doing the objectives.  Update: Competitive is ♥♥♥♥."
This is a amazing game if you love that cartoony style in your Fps games and if you dont take it too seriously its a good game as well with the Tf2 community where you could make some money if you have patience and overall are willing to spend a bit as well.
"This is one of the best Steam games out there. With the wacky cast of characters and the ridiculous amount of hats, this game is sure to bring hours of entertainment."
best game in the world
My favorite class is the spy...
Probably the best multiplayer on PC. I would recommend this with all my heart.
"Thanks for just not ruining my life, but consuming my soul."
"If you are on Steam and don't know how awesome this game is then what the hell are you doing? Try it! TF2 updates constantly. Has plenty of maps with near unlimitted custom, fan-made maps and plenty of addictive potential. You will not regret buying this. Best shooter I've ever played."
"Why doesn't the comunity just work for tf2... Anyways,fun game. Play it. It is free. What else do you want."
Fun game  Loads of hats  What more could you ask for?
"Its a very good game, its allot more fun if you decide to get some strange items, I really enjoy the moment when a strange item levels up"

"  Seems like the whole the 'overwatch is kiling tf2' phase is gone and everything has returned to normal now.I think Team Fortress 2 is a really fun game and like all other valve games it is even more fun if you play with it friends.One thing I also like about this game is the trading community.I am not a big trader but I enjoyed trading my cosmetics (In my opinion the tf2 trading websites are alot better than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s).You will rage, you will quit the game for a while but you will come back.      (Spy is my fav. class) Idk why someone would care but let's not talk about that."
"A titan in the FPS genre, and it shows. An absolutely great game to play, not just for it's creative and innovative mechanics introduced in some of the classes but for the amazing community that drive its casual and competitive scene. Some of my most cherished memories, closest friends and greatest achievements began with clicking the 'Play' button."
"Got this game from a friend, made all my friends through it. Started as idle server trash, started actually playing, joined a highlander team as medic, team died after first game. Bought an unusual, lost my first friend, bought another, sold it, got a strange kritzkrieg.    Get this game. It needs you, and you need it."
This is a great game! It has fun multiplayer and great graphics. Even though it was made 9 years ago (at the time of this writing) it still looks good. I definitely give this 10/10.
This game should only be played on Sundays.
Rule 1 of Team Fortress 2:  It's not unusual
AWSOME GAME ALSO KNOWN AS HAT SIMULATOR   Update ( 11/30/ 16): Still good
  This is the cycle of every Team Fortress 2 player ever:
"Don't really play the game anymore, but the least I can say is that I'm impressed it's holding up so long."
"I recommend this game cause its really simple and easy to understand, unlike other FPS games"
"Jokes aside, TF2 is a great game. Gameplay only got better after all these years, and nothing else really matters. Vavle could've stopped paying as much attention to the game as they did (not talking about cosmetics or backstory here), but community is still amazing. Competitive TF is intense, interesting and fun. If you still, for some reason, haven't tried it, why not? I strongly recommend it to you. It's fun, well aged F2P (since 2011) team based shooter that got me hooked from the first glance. One of my favorite games."
The game is dead
"Play dress up, with guns   I've spent around 2,000 hours on this game, and all I did was having fun, so many good memories that cannot be replaced, not even with the new kid in the block. This game is easely a fps classic, there are some up's and downs but you'll definetly have a good time. Besides, it's Free to Play!, what more you want"
"&gt; I was only 10 years old. &gt; I loved TF2 so much, I had almost all the weapons I wanted. &gt; I would leave my computer on for hours, Just to get a few drops. &gt; Then I got my first hat, The gibus. &gt; Suddenly everything changed. &gt; I no longer cared about playing for fun, I only cared about the 'hats' &gt; I 'borrowed' my mommys credit card and bought more hats. &gt; I had so many hats, I loved them all. &gt; But then someone traded me, I accepted. &gt; They offered an Unusual for all my hats. &gt; It was so sexy looking, I put up all my hats and traded. &gt; But no Unusual, He scammed me. &gt; I lost it all. &gt; I was so sad I cried for hours. &gt; Later that night I prayed to Gaben for my hats back. &gt; I went to bed after praying. &gt; I felt warm. &gt; I looked behind me, It was Gaben! &gt; He said 'This is Gabe Newell' and handed me a Burning TC. &gt; Then I woke up, I was wearing my Burning TC and I was naked. &gt; I saw Gabe leave through the window, he looked back at me and winked. &gt; Hats are love. Hats are life. ...How long ago did i write this lol"
"After playing this game for a nearing amout of 2k hours, I found this game... At times, frustrating to play, while at other times it can be the best game you can play. My recommendation for this game is to just play it a few times, so if you feel like you can handle this hat simulator game, welcome, and have fun!"
"Its all about the hats - in the best possible way  Where else could you spend 1000's of dollars on hats that add not one cent of difference to your damage ability / health or any other stat.    Its free (as much as you want it to be) and fantastic fun in so many many ways. A few hours to be proficient ( you will die a lot ) - hundreds of hours to master ( you still die alot - just not so quickly ).   6,000 hrs - what more needs to be said."
I wasted 3000 hours in this game. But I wouldn't call it a waste.
"This game is a gem, if you are looking for team, class, ans strategy based first person shooter. With more personality than most other shooting games out there."
"Best game ever, nine years on and I'm still playing it."
"I should have probably reviewed this game by now, huh?  If you like wearing hats and occasionally shooting people with rainbows, this is the game for you. Continued support for many years. Frequent updates. Great community. Fun game. Hats. Hats on top of other hats.  Get it. It's free."
"This game is awesome. Its like CoD but way more funny. I love the pyros world and how everything he does is suppose to be nice but hes actually burning someone to death. The best part thought is the great gameplay. This game has too be one of the funniest games I ever played. I mean getting butter knifed in the face can be irritating but it is so funny too see that same spy miss a backstab like 4 times. If i could ever meet one of the characters in real life I would pick the medic. The medic seems so happy and straight up funny. He takes life without worry ( mostly because he can bring back the dead) but he does seem to be a little crazy. If I could be any class it would be a shpee. I say shpee because I would be a baby spy which are called shpees. I would backstab pyros, get blown up by a sentry, fake my death, pyro I just killed burn me, I run to enemy medic, he heals my, I shoot him and miss, and then when all hope seems lost...GABEN...saves me. That would be funny too see and im actually a premium and im pretty good at spy he is a hard class too master. Heres a tip for you though. If your teammate jumps over your head on a staircase or whatever it might be TURN AROUND because hes trying to stair stab you and kill you. Anyway have fun with Tf2. Also watch out for w+m1 pyros. They are the bane of me."
"If your new little tip trade a wep for 1 scrap each trade NOTHING ELSE until you understand how trading works.   btw the best game ive prob ever played as of now Also has one of the most dedicated fan bases ive ever seen, staying with it for almost 10 years and managing to keep it growing and alive.  So thanks to valve and thanks to the community for making this game unique."
"'Just... two more minutes. I know when to quit' Me, 2011-9999"
Hats. That's all I've gotta say. Go play this amazing game

Two teams. Five Snipers. Four Spies. Three screaming drunk Scots. Two Engies. And one angry Medic. 
"One of the best games, destroyed by stupid community and greedy developers."
"After 9 years, I've finally made up my mind and write a review about this game.  It certainly is fun, but unless you're going to invest a lot of time and effort into it, for your own sake, I cannot recommend it. Reason being most players expect you to know how to play each gamemode, each class and each map. Basically, if you don't play well, most players get toxic very quickly. I do believe the situation in Europe regarding F2Ps is worse than anywhere else, but that is just my personal experience. If you still want to try TF2, go ahead, I won't stop you. Just keep in mind, if you want to play it more often, you should consider reading guides, watching videos, etc. to learn more about each class, map, etc.  If you're looking for a competitive, class based FPS, you came to the right game though. The mechanics and roles of each class are more complex than what they look like and the amount of skill you have to put into each class is incredible. 'Krit-Heals', 'jumping someone', 'being forced', etc., just to name a few of the many terms in the competitive scene  TL;DR Good game with active competitive scene. If you plan on putting time and effort into it, go for it. Otherwise look elsewhere."
"Great game! Really interactive, and a more positive community than other games, for sure. Free to play helps new players to really get into the game."
This was my video game black tar heorine PD2 was my heroine 10/10 willing to do drugs for games again

Time well spent
Old but gold. For real...
it's pretty good
"10/10 heavy 10/10 medic 9/11 soldier and demoman, not enough explosions"
"Pros: -Free to Play -Does not meant to be a Pay to Win game -Hats -Unusual, Australium weapons to show off how wealthy you are -Some of the best community ever Cons: -Hackers still running around -P2P have more privileges -Competitive mode is ♥♥♥♥ -Valve heads toward to CS:GO more than TF2 -Everything in the shop is really expensive to some country  Conclusion: TF2 is a fun, FPS, class-based shooter, multiplayer, HATS game that would make F2P players feels like heaven. And it's been standing for 9 years and still counting."

Best First Person Shooter Game IVE EVER PLAYED
"Team Fortress 2 is a first person shooter game with a variety of different classes in offense, defense and support. The reason why I like Team Fortress 2 is because of its variety of gameplay like for example; community servers, vs saxton hale, death run, different gamemodes and more. I highly reccomend this game if you people want to have a really good time. The only downside are the bugs but its still a very good game that has been alive for 8+ years."
BEST GAME IN THE WORLD :)
fun for the whole of your life! 
"I'm re-doing this review because before it was pretty much just 'If you don't like this game you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.' It's not gonna be very long but I still think that I should improve it.   Team Fortress 2 has been a long standing favourite game of mine. I'm pretty sure it was the first ever game I got on Steam. At first I didn't really like it because it wasn't like Call of Duty or Battlefield. But in the end, that's what makes it so amazing. Team Fortress 2 is definitely a Team-centered game. With out teamwork in this game you are pretty much destined to fail. It's not a game where you play just to be good yourself. You play it to have a good community experience and help out your team. Even throughout the years, the TF2 community has managed to stay strong and there is never a shortage of players to play with. With the new matchmaking update, it has also helped insure that all the games you play are always full, and that you usually start with a game that isn't already half way through. It also streamlines the process of finding certain gamemodes you want to play.   Overall, TF2 is an absolutely amazing game if are not looking for another generic First-Person Shooter game, or are just too poor to afford Overwatch."
11/10 Best Game Forever!!   ███████████████   ██████████████  █████████████   ████████████  ███████████  ██████████  █████████  ████████   ███████   ██████  █████  ████  ███  ██  █  ██  ███  ████  █████  ██████  ███████  ████████  █████████  ██████████  ███████████  ████████████  █████████████  ██████████████  ███████████████  ████████████████
Amazing game that has stayed fun no matter how long the game has been out.
It is good .3.
"This game is still entertaining after almost 1,800 hours on it. It has a lot of playstyles mixed with different gamemodes and maps!!"
Cool Game
  This is an amazing game
"Team Fortress 2 is an excellent all-rounder objective based fps game featuring different characters that counter each other which really requires teamwork if skill levels are balanced on both teams. Team Fortress 2 also is considered as a 'casual' game to many gamers bent on setting an image for themselves. Team Fortress 2 is both fast paced or pure strategy based depending on how serious you'd play the game. If you ever do get bored of Valve's standard maps, different unofficial maps and gamemodes do exist within the server search menu. Overall Team fortress 2 is fun and easy to get into since the classes are designed to be simple. it just takes a little getting used to and you're good to go."
"Overall, this game is pretty fun. After 2 years of playing, I have never gotten bored of it. The combat, classes, and HATS make this game extremely fun. Some people complain about casual, exploits, hackers, and things like that, but that has never really bothered me. The game is fun, and I strongly recommend you download the game and try it."
"Valve if you are listening to this, not much people is playing Team Fortress 2 anymore because they are playing Overwatch and your Matchmaking update made the game dead. So if you want Team Fortress 2 to be popular again, I recommend you remove the update"
TF2  Team Friendly 2  Working Hat Simulator
"Rest in Peace Team Fortress 2 October 9th, 2007 - July 6th, 2016  Never Forget.  I got this game in back 2010. 20$, Not a single regret. Played it nearly everyday, that and Halo Reach. Never had a mic, and didn't really bother to get one. Didn't want to annoy my team or anyone else. Knew I wasn't a funny clever kid and didn't care for attention. Did my entire social studies project on this game and Valve back when I was younger. I even got an e-mail from  gaben@valvesoftware.com  after sending it to him. Played on surf servers and some specific pub games because this was back when the official server system was abysmal. Actually got pretty damn good at surfing in the interest of time. Playing the game with the people on those servers for all that time was a stress reliver, an escape from school, my dull life, and my irritating family. Computer became sloppy about a year later. Wanted to play all the new games that were releasing and wanted to play all the new TF2 updates. Waited years to finally get a new rig just to play this game, no other game really mattered. Picked right back up around the time MVM surfaced. Loaded myself with tickets, some item surplus too. I cherished everything I missed in all of those years away. I took breaks from the game of course and played through Deus Ex: HR, Sniper Elite V2, and Cryisis.   I grew up with this game, and I poured my heart and soul into it. Loved everything about it.   Rest in Peace."
The matchmaking update killed this game.
Great
"I like about TF2 because this is awesome and fun,you can unlocked or craft many thing,like hats,guns and many more.There is also a MILLION OR THOUSAND PEOPLE PLAYED TF2 !!!! 10/10 Best game i ever played in my whole life !

"This new update sucks.  Quickplay is gone. In its place is a convoluted matchmaking system that sucks in every possible way. Confusing categories, unbalanced teams, and awful connection times. And this update was supposed to bring new life to tf2. Good job, Valve. Ya blew it. I loved this game, but ya blew it."
Great game!
Its the best Game I ever played in years cool items and Updates Get dis game XD
Do you know the Hatman? -Tilliot 2014.
TF2  Team Friendly 2  Working Hat Simulator
"Rest in Peace Team Fortress 2 October 9th, 2007 - July 6th, 2016  Never Forget.  I got this game in back 2010. 20$, Not a single regret. Played it nearly everyday, that and Halo Reach. Never had a mic, and didn't really bother to get one. Didn't want to annoy my team or anyone else. Knew I wasn't a funny clever kid and didn't care for attention. Did my entire social studies project on this game and Valve back when I was younger. I even got an e-mail from  gaben@valvesoftware.com  after sending it to him. Played on surf servers and some specific pub games because this was back when the official server system was abysmal. Actually got pretty damn good at surfing in the interest of time. Playing the game with the people on those servers for all that time was a stress reliver, an escape from school, my dull life, and my irritating family. Computer became sloppy about a year later. Wanted to play all the new games that were releasing and wanted to play all the new TF2 updates. Waited years to finally get a new rig just to play this game, no other game really mattered. Picked right back up around the time MVM surfaced. Loaded myself with tickets, some item surplus too. I cherished everything I missed in all of those years away. I took breaks from the game of course and played through Deus Ex: HR, Sniper Elite V2, and Cryisis.   I grew up with this game, and I poured my heart and soul into it. Loved everything about it.   Rest in Peace."
The matchmaking update killed this game.
"Its just amazing, even though the last couple of months have been a rough road for the TF2 Community, im glad this game is still awesome, and has been since its debut in the 'Orange Box.' If your looking for something casual or something fun and competitive, i recommend this game for you!"
Its a funny game but valve messed with some community-server changes...  Nice game but bad community-server restrictions from valve. :/
Used to be a great game but bad updates ruined it.
really awesome game!! would recommend
Easily the greatest multiplayer team shooter ever made and it only gets better and better with time.
"Best game ever, people should get this game.Even after years of it being released, its still quite fun with the custom game mode made by other players like Death Run and Jailbreak."
Nothing to say. Father of all free-to-play shooters. 8/10
My favorite class is the spy...
"  -Quick Review-    Oh goodness, I haven't reviewed Team Fortress 2 yet?  Designed by Valve Corporation in 2007 but never really lost popularity, Team Fortress 2 is a First Person Shooter which embraces it's cartoon design to such an extreme that it's comical. There are community events, guilds/clans that are dedicated to playing, tons of achievements to earn, Nine different Classes; Team Fortress 2 is fun to play causally or if you really get sucked into the game you can spend many hours playing it.    -Detailed breakdown review-    Story:  The story is the same every game:   It's Red Vs Blue  . If you'd like more 'story' I'd recommend watching all the 'Meet the ______' Class videos, the Spy, Pyro, Heavy.... who am I kidding, each class video is hilarious and you should watch them anyway.   Game Play:  There are Nine Classes; Scout, Soldiers, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy. Each class has its own unique play style, if you want to know more there are plenty of guides out there to explain how to play each one respectively, and doesn't have a place in this review. The game controls and plays like a First Person Shooter, you have different weapons based on your class, you always have: A Melee weapon, A primary and secondary Gun/weapon  (which you can change in your 'loadout') , then some accessories to make your character look unique/different/stupid/funny/ugly/annoying/crazy. One final thing worth note, is that this game never seems to go 'out of style', until there's a Team Fortress 3 (which we all know Valve can't count that high) Team Fortress 2 has stayed one of the top  10 games played on steam  since the time I got my steam account until today (05/23/15) Currently there are 79,860 people playing it, and it's not even peak time.   Achievements:  Team Fortress 2 has 513 Achievements, there are achievements for specific levels/matches, each Class, and certain community events (Halloween, Christmas, etc) . There are many achievements, I haven't seen anyone that has earned them all legitimately. (Many people hack their achievements to get unlockables)   Price:  Team Fortress 2 is now Free to play, they've made so much money on hats that everyone can have the game for free, but need to buy hats. This was one of the first games I had on my steam account, I purchased the Orange Box and got this game with that purchase. Since it's Free to play, you can certainly try this game whenever you'd like, but there's a good chance you already know if you want to play it or not. Thanks for taking the time to read my review anyway. :P   Conclusion:  I recommend this game for pretty much anyone, not everyone will latch onto the game and play it for thousands of hours, but many will at least get 10 hours of entertainment out of the game. However, beware the allure of Team Hat Fortress 2...

"9.5/10 If you've been in a cave for the last 7 years, then you may have not heard of a 'Little' game called TF2. TF2 is a class-based FPS, i. e. different characters and loadouts. TF2 strays away from the militaristic style of TF1, and adds a breath of fresh air to the FPS industry, unlike the MONOTONOUS BLACK OPS S- Oops, did I get ahead of myself. The gameplay is so unique, you'll be hooked for life. Every single weapon is different. From rocket launchers to shotguns to pistols to soda to conch shells to lasers to exploding cannon balls - whew. The beauty of this game lies in its totally unique item system. You can acquire items by playing the game, buying them (Hey, they gotta make a profit), or by crafting them. Weapons are used to put up a fight, hats are hard to acquire, but are worth a lot and can make you look like a boss, and tools can be used for various purposes, like opening crates or spreading keys. However, it is F2P, but in a good way. The people who buy the stuff have no clear advantage over the F2Pers. The best part of the game is the classes. They all are different and unique. Take the Soldier. Soldier is your one man army, armed with a RPG, a shotgun, and a shovel, although like all classes, this can be changed. He is a steryotypical crazed patriot from the midwest, and is smart as a pecan. (Not smart). There's also a co-op mode against robots, literal robots who run on piles of money, and the game's fan base can create content on GMOD, increasing the media for this game. One major thing that iffs me is that some things you can unbox from Mann Co Supply Crates (A gimmick for you to buy keys to get a mystery prize) are not even worth how much the key was worth. Stranges and strange parts are sometimes looked down on in the community. Other then that, it's great. "
This game is awesome!
It was good before it became csgo bootleg garbage. The Casual is dog ♥♥♥♥ and it should be terminated asap.MAKE TF2 GREAT AGAIN!
"This is one of the best Steam games out there. With the wacky cast of characters and the ridiculous amount of hats, this game is sure to bring hours of entertainment."
THIS GAME I S EPIC E P I C
I LOVE this game! Is there anything else to say?
"In 2016 they decided to add competitive mode, when it was needed 7 or 8 years ago. #Valvetime"
this game used to be fun but after the latest update everything went to ♥♥♥♥. im not saying its dying but i played it safe and tranfered my items into csgo skins. it still a great game but not what it used to be 0/10 would drink bleach again.
Everybody should play this game during Halloween
"Not bad for a free game, fun and humorious."
"I predict this game will be alive for another 6-8 years. Dies both from from old blood AND outdated code.  Also because it's not WoW. ... wait a minute...     Anyway, when it dies, I also predict that in later years when talking about this game people will joke around about the fuc king hats (it's such a great platform for jokes, isn't it?) and not the great balance and fun possibilities this game had. The *TEAM* play, the impact it had on us, as experienced gamers, and the new ones - which started when the game was around, with the game. The money Gabe made with this game.  Truly a successful game by all elements and terms. Don't talk about hats."
my moms say its good
"Unusual weapons with the possibility of being strange really made me ruin my master card but hey worth it!  Probably a bad time to write this, so will probably have to edit it later atm I really hope valve brings back old quickplay so when I feel like relaxing I can go to quickplay and when i feel like tryharding for fun I can go casual.  Ohh well I didn't really do much relaxing on tf2 after starting to make videos anyways other then having fun making videos but still gonna miss being abit annoyed and just have it completely gone by playing abit on a pub and seeing some stupid stuff etc.  anyways Casual = between quickplay and competetive so medics tryharding and pocketing soldiers, tryharding demomans and soldiers in a huge bunch. so basicaly competetive and casual is pretty much the same stupidity with just bunch of the best classes in the game aka soldier and demoman (sniper if you're very good ofc) and they are actualy trying now."
They done it.
"I really recommend this game, but it's slowly dying cuz it has only 40,000 ppl playing or something. I believe in the future, Team Fortress 2 would beat a game called 'Overwatch'. This game, Tf2 has 9 classes which had different play styles, plus there were 3 types of styles for you to play such as MvM, Casual and Competitive. I hoped that Tf2 will get back to normal like in the date when it's released. :)"
"Team Fortress 2 is one of the best games on steam, its fun,exciting,etc. I highly recommend that anyone who starts playing TF2 is forced to finished all thier trainings before they join the game, this way new players will have more fun playing the game then waste their time knowing wut to do, when they complete all of their training, other gamemodes will be unlocked and they can procede to play the game. I highly recommend to get and play Team Fortress 2, like i said earlier, its fun, exciting,etc."
this game is just one of valves greatest Massively multiplayer games. I recommend this!
This game helped me find who I really am : A selfish tryhard who only cares about himself and kills friendlies when they don't have hats. 10/10
"A real fun game, a great community, and it can be easy to lose track of time in this game."
You sort of get bored after the first hour.
Great Game GG
"Possibly the greatest game out to date, and given that Team Defense Fort 12 is nearly a decade old at this point, that's really saying something. I may not be the oldest player, or the best, the richest, the nicest, the most social, etc, but I still love this game, the community of friends it's helped me find, and the fun I have while playing.  Also the Loose Cannon and it's Double Donks. God bless Double Donks."
10/10
"This game is pretty good... If you like a non-existent development team. The actual TF2 team must not play the ♥♥♥♥ing game at all, because they are completely oblivious to what the players want. They buffed the Phlog ffs. Until the TF2 team starts making some good ♥♥♥♥ing choices, play Overwatch."
Before this update I would rate the game 9/10. After this update I give it 2/10. The main problem is not what they added but what they removed. If they only would of kept the valve quick play pub servers a ton of players would not have had a problem with the update. But by removing these servers they forced players to use the new casual system. And let me tell you it is not casual. Some of the things we lost I will list below.  1. You can not just look for a valve pub server to join quick any more. You have to join a que to play on the valve servers. 2. This que can take up to 4 to 10 minutes to get in (for me) 3. If you want just one map expect to wait even longer 4. They removed some maps that were in the rotation before this update 5. After one side wins you get to go through it all again because you just can't keep playing without queing up again.  Yes people will say go play the community servers but 90% of them are trash. The rest usually have 24/7 of the same map or don't have players on the maps you want to play. So until valve corrects this I can't bring myself to give this a thumbs up.

"&gt;Plays TF2 first time in four months &gt;Refuses to work unless connected to in-game community &gt;Refuses to CONNECT to said community  gg 8/8 Valve    In all seriousness, TF2 was once a game where you could choose how YOU want to play in any server avaliable. The ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles continues for years.  ... Then comes along the cancer of an update that is Meet Your Match. I'll flat out say it: I'm a casual gamer, with bouts of being on do-what-you-want fun servers (well... that depends on what your definition of 'fun' is: dicking around with your friends or trolling everything that exists on that server, idk) just to relax in my own, unorthodox (and occasionally, semi-perverse) ways. I tend to stay in those servers because I'm a bit of a cancer when competitive. Meet Your Match pretty much prioritizes competitive mode (from my experience, anyways). I'd like TF2 to remain the great game it once was, not slowly degenerate into something that will eventually resemble a glorified COD ♥♥♥♥ stain, thank you very much.  I've tried, guys. I've honestly tried. As of MYM, TF2 is just not worth any amount of time unless you are in the group of people who think screeching into a mic 'g3t r3kt, m8' in competitive is considered civil.  Sorry, TF2. But I have better ways to waste my time. Writing this review ISN'T one of them."

"I don't know what to put here so heres a summary of the camel instead  Camels were domesticated more than 3,000 years ago, and to this day, humans depend on them for transport across arid environments. They can easily carry an extra 200 pounds (90 kilograms) while walking 20 miles (32 kilometers) a day in the harsh desert. Camels can travel as fast as horses but can also endure legendary periods of time without food or water. Humans have used camels for their wool, milk, meat, leather, and even dung, which can be used for fuel.  The dromedary camel, also known as the Arabian camel, exists today only as a domesticated animal. About 90 percent of the world’s camels are dromedaries. There are two types of Bactrian camels: wild and domesticated. Wild Bactrian camels are much trimmer, with smaller humps and less hair, than domesticated Bactrian camels."

Another game for valve to get money...
This game is the bomb and i think everyone and i mean everyone should play it its fun and there r so many things to explore!!!
"In your first 50 or so hours of the game, you just think it's...okay. You're not very coordinated, you're not used to your weapons, and people are always making fun of 'OH, YOU'RE SO BAD, LOOK AT ME, I'VE GOT FANCY HATS, THAT MUST MEAN I'M BETTER THAN YOU AT THE GAME!!'  But once you dedicate some time and some effort, (And maybe some muny...) You'll find that Team Fortress 2 is a blast.  It's just like any other FPS, but if you're like me, and you're not really into those super-realistic shooting games, then Team Fortress 2 is the game for you.  You can get your friends in the game, and compromise some strategic team composition. Or you can just be a Scout, and swing your aluminum bat all willy-nilly.  You can play from at least a dozen different game modes, from pushing a bomb into a death pit, to fighting off hordes of blood-thirsty robots, and if you get your friends in on it, you'll have the time of your life.  You can master a certain class, such as the Soldier, shooting rockets, and hitting people with shovels, or the Medic, who heals people and can activate an extremely powerful and game-changing ability called an Ubercharge.  You can trade with your friends or others, discover and master countless custom weapons, make your class look stunning with hats and other cosmetics.  Do I recommend this game? ABSOLUTELY. I know there's someone reading this who hasn't played Team Fortress 2, and to that person I must say as Uncle Sam has before...  I want YOU. To play TEAM FORTRESS 2."
"Valve making more TF2 hats instead of Half Life 3, confirmed."

eh it alright
"Easily one of my favourite games ever. Most of the weapons are well balanced, and the combat is absolutely insanely fun. What's more, it's free! (Strictly speaking, you should buy at least one thing from the Mann Co store to get the full fun out of it, but that's like a $0.50 outlay, which heck, you can get with trading cards)."
"This Game is the best. Super fun and so many customization options, like cosmetics and weapons. I have 600+ hours and have spent around 50 USD."
"TF2: A Game Being Hurt by its Developers  When you accumulate 2,700+ hours (at the time of writing this review, also I have no life :c ) in a game, I feel like a review is warranted.   For a game that has lasted over 7+ years and still has a solid player base of around 50,000 players online at any given time, there has to be something special about Team Fortress 2, and there is. Personally, I believe it's the versatility Valve has created for the game. Players aren't limited to the vanilla TF2 that the developers originally created. There are many of third party servers filled with custom game modes made by the community such as Versus Saxton Hale, Jailbreak, and much more that have kept the game alive. It is the TF2 community's desire to expand on the what Valve laid the foundation for that has made the game as popular as it is today. When you get bored of regular TF2 that revolves around nine playable classes that duke it out to the death, there is so much more to play that keeps the game fresh.  The core gameplay is also very enjoyable. With each of the nine classes bringing a unique mechanic to the table, ranging from projectile weapons to hit-scan weapons, there is a class that will speak to almost everyone. To supplement this, there are multiple game modes to play on such as Payload, Control Point, Attack/Defend, King of the Hill, and much more. Each one provides a fun experience that will keep you playing hours on end. The game revolves a lot around teamwork and coordination but has room for individuals to make big plays. TF2 brings special aspect to a first-person shooter that hasn't been found in many other FPS and makes it stand out.   Now on to the more critical point(s) of the review:  1) The Implementation of Competitive:  In recent times, I feel like the developers of TF2 are really beginning to destroy the game. When you play the game for 1000+ hours, you begin to notice things that are starting to hinder the game.   One the main issues that I have is the direction of how competitive Valve wants the game to be. What I mean by this is whether the game should be a competitive type of game like CSGO or a casual game which TF2 has been for years. As of now, it has been confusing, especially with the recent Meet Your Match update. Originally, the game was purely a casual type of game. Friendly heavies everywhere, random critical hits, players comparing hats, and players from both blue and red teams conga-ing in harmony. Overall, it was a very laid back game. While there has been always a competitive side birthed by the TF2 community since its release, Valve hasn't really acknowledged them until around the time period of this review. And that is sort of the problem. Only now is Valve beginning to make the game competitive. That isn't bad or anything, but the issue is that their attempt to create a competitive TF2 scene seems half-♥♥♥♥♥.   My main example: Competitive mode in its beta form is almost no different than its so called 'final' form or the form on its release. There are so many issues that plagued this mode that were brought up by the community while it was in beta. Many of them still exist today that deter from the competitive experience such as the current competitive ranking system. I've played in a few third party competitive TF2 sites and compared to them, the TF2 version of matchmaking feels like a still-developing game mode that is competitive only in name.   2) The transition from a Casual to a Competitive Game:  Another problem that is hurting the game is Valve's sloppy transition from casual to competitive. What used to be known as Quick Play, now has been transformed into a shell of its former self in Casual Mode. The simplicity of casual TF2 has been destroyed with the frustrating features/lack of features. One of my main (maybe petty) annoyances is the system in which players now join servers in CASUAL MODE. As it is now, the max amount of people you can have in a party is six. For the numerous Valve servers that can sport up to 12 players PER team, it is very upsetting that Valve prevents players from having parties up to the max players per team. Not only that, while before you could join a friend's game in progress manually, Valve has prevented that making only so you can join random games through the casual mode matchmaking system. This does have its perks though. For one, kicking the ever so increasing number of hackers has become easier (well if the vote passes).   3) Conclusion:  Don't get me wrong, TF2 is a fun game. But in conclusion, with the recent updates, Valve seems to be on the line on making TF2 fully competitive. Why? While the UI of the game may seem competitive, the core gameplay isn't. Valve is trying to make TF2 something the core gameplay isn't matching which is competitive and it makes the game not flow together well. Having random critical hits in a competitive styled Casual Mode is a small sign of evidence of that. Along with this most of the interface is sloppily made and not user friendly as it could be. If you just want to play TF2 for fun, I think it's a hard time to be a TF2 player without encountering frustration at every end with Valve.   Overall, I would give it a 6/10 as it is now.  TLDR for New Players: I can't ensure that you will enjoy TF2 in the current state it is in. If you're a new player, I feel like it would be hard to enjoy TF2 to the fullest and would not recommend unless you're willing to brave the frustration or Valve fixes the game.  TDLR for Older Players: Not much has really changed in the core mechanics of the game. If you're looking to get back into TF2 and played mostly in Valve servers, be prepared for the chance to become annoyed with the features/lack of. The community servers remained mostly the same with the only difference being that they gained a section dedicated solely for them."
"If you want to get into TF2 for it's fantastic mapping community, sfm community, in-jokes, comics, art, then go ahead. You find some of the best people ever.  But if you want a game that's balanced, that runs well, where it's easy to hop in and out of servers, with a promising comptetive scene, with developers that care and listen to community feedback- then go literally anywhere else, because you won't find that here.  Sorry Valve, but I am now giving TF2 a negative review.  I think it might be dying.  I hope this isn't the end though. There's still time for this game to be saved, we can hope."
A really fun game to play.

"Epic story line, ending makes me cry everytime :')"
Greatest hat simulator I have ever played
"Have you ever played a first person shooter that you really loved? After a while, they usually get a little drab if the developers don't update them. Team Fortress is always evolving thanks to Valve's relentless agenda. Sometimes the true meaning of a game is hidden in the first letter of each sentence."
its ok... i guess. not like i wasted 2 whole summers playing this or whatever
pretty good
Very balanced game. Easy to learn. Hard to master
"I, I am a soldier. I don't know what my name is. All I know, is that Mann Co has taken me in and raised me to fight for them. They told me that my parents are dead and that the town I was born in was destroyed a long time ago. Their training has born fruit, as I ended a substantial amount of lives in the past three decades.   Currently, I am stationed in Badwater which has been under siege by the BLU, our sworn enemies, for a week now. Civilian unrest is rising, and riots are imminent. While I understand their concerns and anger, we must still win this war, so we are forced to quell them by any means necessary, whether it'd be peaceful or violent. Morale is at an all time low. This whole battle has gone to ♥♥♥♥. Our sergeant still has his hopes up, though, and we are ordered to follow our superiors to hell and back on their command.   But I feel peaceful, like I'm in an empty field where you don't hear gunfire and explosions, but the chirping birds and the trees in the wind. Wait, there's someone over there, I should go and...  'Wake up, you useless MAGGOT!'  I fell out of my bunk bed, but still had the (will)power to address him (thank god). SIR, YES SIR! I got up (by myself, of course. Sgt. Morris would've laughed his ♥♥♥ off if I asked for help, but not in the good fun way, if you know what I mean). I packed my gear and went outside to scout the area and see what the rioters and BLU are planning.   And then, a loud bang was heard. I immediatly jumped to cover, and after a few seconds of hiding, I looked back at the base. It has been entirely demolished. I ran back (although while under cover) and saw that everyone had perished due to either the blast, the rubble or the fire. I hear a faint call for help, and I rushed there to see Sergeant Morris, legs blown off, covered in blood and rubble, and ran to him.   'Soldier', he said. 'Please, Soldier... run! Get out of this war! Make sure you can start over! The war hasn't... been... lost'. He died immediatly after he spoke his final words. Start over, he said. But... I have nowhere to go. What the hell do I need to do now? I tried to think, but I was thrown out of thought by a blue blur. Is that.... An engineer? What is he doing on the battlefield? I ran after him while firing rockets at the scouts trying to stop me. I almost had him, but I was hit by a tranquilizing dart. I fell on the ground, barely concsious, and a BLU sniper stood next to me. A few of their Heavies held me up. 'Good night, ♥♥♥♥♥♥' was the last thing I heard before he knocked me unconcsious.   'Ja, zis patient is ze optimal test subject!' I opened my eyes and tried to get up, but my limbs were bound to a table. 'Easy zere, schweinhund. Zere's nowhere you can go'. A medic looked at me with an unnerving grin and pulled a syringe out of a box. 'You feelthy REDs have opposed us for long enough, you know zat? We always had ze optimal ideas for zis welt, you know? But you dreckschweinhunde always tried to stop us? Do you know how MAD zat makes me?' I tried to reply, but I didn't know what to say. 'Zis medicine right here, will cure you from ze programming the REDs have knocked into you. How does zat sound? A free life in a welt run by ze BLUs would be in your best eenterests, nein? Eef not, take zis!' He stabbed me with the needle, but I didn't feel brainwashed, I felt stronger. 'SHEIßE! Zat was the wrong syringe! Zose were my experimental steroids!' I ripped the binds off, and punched the medic in the face, which threw him against the wall. 'Wait, nein! no! Please, don't hurt me!' I grabbed him and snapped his neck. 'hil...fe' were his final words, as he fell on the ground lifelessly.   An alarm went off, and shortly after, soldiers were already swarming the room. 'Hands up, maggot!' one of them screamed. I saw a teleported labeled as '?'. I ran for it while they shot at me, and strangely enough, my body reflected the bullets without any pain. One of them jumped in my way, but I knocked him over effortlessly. I jumped in the teleporter, and it teleported me right before it broke down. I saw nothing but light as I floated down, and then I hit the ground.  I woke up, but I felt very different. I raised my palm in front of my face. The first thing I noticed, is that my arm has a strong brown tan, not unlike our Demomen. I was white all of my life, so how could this happen? The next thing I noticed is that I was... female? Due to my upbringing, I barely saw any women at all, let alone with my own eyes. But yet I knew that I switched genders. I got up, and I hear a faint voice behind me. 'Fareeha?'   It sounded very german, so I thought it was the medic. I raised my differently looking rocket launcher at the figure. 'Wait, what are you doing? It's me! Angela!'. Suddenly, I saw her more clearly. She was a slim figure with white clothes, technological wings, blonde hair and she had golden halo-like headwear. When I saw her, the memories of my previous life faded, and were filled with new ones. I felt like I actually was this 'Fareeha'. 'You were unconscious for about an hour! What happened?' I replied with that I was knocked out of the sky by a brownish figure with flamboyant blond but burned hair, what was his name, Trashmouse or something? 'It's okay, love. we're still together', Angela replied. Love, I thought? Suddenly, the questions I had were replaced by the romantic feelings I had for her. Before I could reply, a serious looking old man came in the med ward. 'What are you jokers doing now? Stop wasting time!' Another old man in a knight outfit entered the room as well, and replied with 'Let them be, Morrison! You know how ze so called sky lesbians can be when zey're alone!'  'Morrison'. That name reminds me of my old sergeant, but I know this man way better. He is Jack Morrison. And it all became clear now. The teleporter teleported me from the second realm of Team Fortress to the land of... Overwatch? I used to be a soldier, and the teleporter turned me into Pharah. Yes, I know who I am now. I feel way happier knowing these people and fighting for them instead of Mann Co and its corrupt leaders. I am still a soldier, but under a different, better banner. I just hope that my mom Ana doesn't find out about my relationship ;)  The End.   Written by SnarkySnickers. I know how bloody, exponentially, way too ****ing cringeworthy this story is, but I felt like practicing my writing skills, and in what other way to do that than writing a drama story about my migration from TF2 to Overwatch? The hidden meaning is that I played TF2 for 3 years, so that's why it's mostly tf2."
The is one of the best games you will ever play :P
waste of life
TF2 &gt; Games with no hats
"great game animations really great lots of fun, good weapon choises, extremely enjoyable, lots of game moads overall 9/10 suberb game :)"
"I have played this game for few hours and it's weird because everyone calls me a noob. I don't know why... maybe they are jelaous because I just got this awesome gibus thing hat for free and I think it's the coolest hat in the game. Someone wanted to buy it once but I don't know how to trade so it didn't work out. Well to be honest I wouldn't have sold it because it's awesome! So I was wondering that does only good players get that hat or how to get it because there aren't many people who have it, I think. I have seen few players wearing it and I was like omg you have this cool hat too and I tried to ask him how to get it, but I guess he was too busy destroying everyone because he didn't even answer me. Well pro players don't have much time to chat back to others even though I had that same hat. The strangest thing I was wondering was that how did I get that professional players hat so quickly, I played this game for like 3 hours and I already had it. Maybe it's because I have amazing call of duty skills. Well I stopped playing call of duty for good yesterday because I found this cool game where I don't need to do any teamwork so I can just kill everyone alone. Like in call of duty I had to do a lot of 'teamwork' to keep everyone alive but here I can just go to a server and rek everyone who gets on my way. So I started this game yesterday and I love it, because I was already good in fps games like this, so it didn't take more than like 1 hour for me to get used on this. I would rate 10 bananas out of 8 strawberries for this game!"
haven't spent enough time to give my full opinion but the game is pretty good
  one of the best games i play  i really like the characters and the story also i like multiplayer and team work to win  also it has items so i really enjoy trading there
love it play it all the time cuz i have no life
Awesome game. No questions asked.

Best game ever created 10/10.
"Ded, not a big surprise"
Good fun free game
Thousands of the best hours of my life
"A rubber duck is a toy shaped like a stylized duck, generally yellow with a flat base. It may be made of rubber or rubber-like material such as vinyl plastic. The yellow rubber duck has achieved an iconic status in Western pop culture and is often symbolically linked to bathing. Various novelty variations of the toy are produced.  The history of the rubber duck is linked to the emergence of rubber manufacturing in the late 19th century. The earliest rubber ducks were made from harder rubber. Sculptor Peter Ganine created a sculpture of a duck in the 1940s, then patented it and reproduced it as a floating toy, of which over 50,000,000 were sold. Jim Henson popularized rubber ducks in 1970, performing the songs 'Rubber Duckie' and 'DUCKIE' as Ernie, a popular Muppet from Sesame Street. Ernie frequently spoke to his duck and carried it with him in other segments of the show. On a special occasion, Little Richard performed the song. C.W. McCall's hit song Convoy, (and the movie and novel it inspired) are narrated from the viewpoint of a character who replaced the bulldog hood ornament on his Mack truck with a bathtub toy and used the on-air handle of 'Rubber Duck'. Besides the ubiquitous yellow rubber duck with which most people are familiar, there have been numerous novelty variations on the basic theme, including character ducks representing professions, politicians, or licensed individual celebrities. There are also ducks that glow in the dark, change colour, have interior LED illumination, or include a wind-up engine that enables them to 'swim'. In 2001, The Sun, a British tabloid newspaper reported that Queen Elizabeth II has a rubber duck in her bathroom that wears an inflatable crown. The duck was spotted by a workman who was repainting her bathroom. The story prompted sales of rubber ducks in the United Kingdom to increase by 80% for a short period. Rubber ducks are collected by a small number of enthusiasts. The 2007 Guinness World Record for World's Largest Rubber Duck Collection stood at 1,439 different rubber ducks, and was awarded to Charlotte Lee. China's 'Great Firewall' blocks searches for 'big yellow duck' after a doctored photograph replacing tanks with giant rubber ducks in a famous Tiananmen Square Massacre photograph, Tank Man, became popular. In 2013 rubber ducks were inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame. Rubber Ducks joined a list of only 52 other toys that have also inducted into the Hall of Fame since its founding in 1998.  Rubber duck races, also known as derby duck races, have been used as a method of fundraising for organizations worldwide. People donate money to the organization by sponsoring a duck. At the end of the fundraising drive, all of the ducks are dumped into a waterway, with the first to float past the finish line winning a prize for its sponsor. There are hundreds of races held in the USA and internationally. The largest race in the United States is the annual Freestore Foodbank Rubber Duck Regatta in Cincinnati, Ohio. First run in 1994, the Rubber Duck Regatta now features over 100,000 ducks raced to raise money for the organization. Since its beginning in 1994 the Rubber Duck Regatta in Cincinnati Ohio has raised over $4.6 million and over $500,000 alone last year. The annual Aspen Ducky Derby was first run by the Rotary Club of Aspen, Colorado in 1991. The derby now features 30,000 ducks and takes place each August in Aspen's Rio Grande Park. Through its past 20 years, the Aspen Ducky Derby has raised more than $2.3 million to benefit 65 nonprofit groups. One of the more famous rubber duck races is the Great Knoxville Rubber Duck Race. This race received attention when the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled that it was a lottery, which stopped the race for a few years. After the state amended its constitution to allow lotteries with special exceptions, the race was reinstituted. The Derby Duck race sees over 40,000 ducks race to benefit the Boys and Girls Club of Tennessee valley. A famous rubber duck race is the Halifax Duck Derby. This race has 10,000 rubber ducks in the Halifax Harbour along Bishops Landing. There is a grand prize of $1 million Canadian dollars; other prizes include a trip to anywhere in Canada, large screen TVs, and more. This race has been very successful in raising money and awareness for its organizations. The Lumsden Duck Derby is a Labour Day tradition in the town of Lumsden, Saskatchewan, 31 km northwest of Regina. Founded in 1988 to help the town raise funds for a new ice rink, nowadays the Derby races 25 000 rubber ducks down a stretch of the Qu'Appelle River and features a grand prize of CAD$1 million. The town makes a day out of it, with a pancake breakfast, bands and other entertainments, kids' activities, and a 'parade to the post.' The Great Brisbane Duck Race is held on the Brisbane River each year to raise funds for the PA Research Foundation. The 100-metre (330 ft) race saw 30,000 rubber ducks enter the race in 2011. The PA Research Foundation also holds a Team Duck Race Challenge where groups are invited to raise funds and participate in either the motorised or non-motorised Team Duck Race with a large 26-centimetre (10 in) tall rubber duck that teams can decorate, brand and modify. One other race was conducted in Australia in January 1988. It was run from the 'High-level bridge' to the 'Low-level bridge' near Katherine, Northern Territory on the Australia Day long weekend. Acting on behalf of the town's Bicentennial Committee, Royal Australian Air Force officers Andrew Cairns and Jock MacGowan constructed the release cage from PVC pipe, purchased and numbered the ducks, printed tickets, and even arranged a helicopter flypast. In Stockbridge, Edinburgh since 1988, the Stockbridge Community Festival has held the annual Stockbridge Duck Race to raise money for local charities. 1000 rubber ducks are released into the Water of Leith at the Stockbridge to float downstream to the finishing post at the Falshaw Bridge. The 2010 race was memorable for a sudden rain shower at the finish line. The 2011 race was held on 3 July with proceeds going to local charities Stockbridge House &amp; St. Columba's Hospice. For over 25 years, Bibury in Gloucestershire has hosted an annual Duck Race on Boxing Day. The charity event, which attracts thousands of spectators, is split into two races; one featuring the iconic yellow ducks, the other featuring the more realistic 'decoy' ducks, both held on the River Coln. On 31 August 2008, the Great British Duck Race was held near Hampton Court Palace in London. The race broke the world record for the number of ducks used together, with a total of 250,000. The ducks used in the race were a bright blue color, after stewards in the previous year faced problems from spectators throwing their own ducks into the water. Each year, on Easter Monday, a duck race is organised in Glenridding by the local mountain rescue team to raise funds. Another is the Manchester Duck Race, held at Spinningfields on the River Irwell each Good Friday, with several thousand ducks. During a Pacific storm on 10 January 1992, three 40-foot containers holding 29,000 Friendly Floatees plastic bath toys from a Chinese factory were washed off a ship. Two-thirds of the ducks floated south and landed three months later on the shores of Indonesia, Australia, and South America. The remaining 10,000 ducks headed north to Alaska and then completed a full circle back near Japan, caught up in the North Pacific Gyre current as the so-called Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Many of the ducks then entered the Bering Strait between Alaska and Russia and were trapped in the Arctic ice. They moved through the ice at a rate of one mile per day, and in 2000 they were sighted in the North Atlantic. The movement of the ducks had been monitored by American oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer. Bleached by sun and seawater, the ducks and beavers had faded to white, but the turtles and frogs had kept their original colors. "
Shooting people in the torso to make 10 year olds irrationally angry is a once in a lifetime experience.
Gud game but i get kick everytime for griefin nubs like dis if u cri every tiem:) actually best game ever 100%for originality
It's a game. 
I wish I didn't
It's kinda like a ♥♥♥♥ overwatch.
All u need to know is crouch=friendly 10/10
TF2 sucks now. The best part of the game was beng able to easily drop in and out of matches.
"Its a good game but I wish the searching was removed. It is so annyoing to have just joined a game then have it end then to search again. Please remove it,"
Amazing and free to play
Pretty cool game.
"If this game was a spoon, it would be a fork."
"Gud Game , addicted to it lol"
"This game has gone down hill so fast, it actually used to be fun but the players and the game itself has gotten cancerous. Instead of adding diverse weapons, immersive maps and, fun game mods, the TF2 devs just keep adding cosmetics and taunts so instead of being a good player, you are a materialistic, immature worm who turns his character into a virtual barbie for all the other barbie players to see. Don't fall for the stuff I did, dont get this game, I spent more than $30 on cosmetics and I regret every cent of it, I got caught in the vacuum of wanting a virtual character to look good, which proved nothing. Don't fall for this game, its a trap for you to spend money so the TF2 team can use that money to make more cosmetic items and barbie skins for guns to take even more of your money. Be smart"
"What used to be the best free-to-play shooter is now just a game people who can't afford overwatch play. All the best and veteran players moved on to overwatch while the charm of this game was completely killed with the competitive and casual mode fiasco. Thanks for the fun times tf2, but it's time to move on."
Update broke the game.
Play overwatch instead.
"Before I go any further I just want to say, I love this game to death. Never has a game kept me coming back year after year after year, but Team fortress 2 sure as hell did.  Meet your Match is an update that divided the community, harmed the growth of the game, showed how little valve truely cares, and most importantly, what happens when the players of the game are ignored.  Team Fortress 2 in my opinion has been a journey with highs and lows over the last few years. I loved 2011 and 2012, 2013 was a very nice update haven for mann vs machine and tf2 halloween fans like myself, 2014 felt awful compared to the previous years with the exception of love and war, but then came 2015 and 2016... holy @&amp;$%.  These last two years have been terrible for TF2, in the process of modernising the game it failed to stay true to what it was. Gun mettle was fine but everything else felt more like valve never played the game before. Update after update it slowly made less and less sense. Demoknights getting nerfed to high hell, phlog getting buffed to high hell.  But then Meet your match came out, removing quickplay, having a terrible competitive and casual mode, weapon changes that made no sense, locked viewmodel fovs, and everyones favorite matchmaking times and server issues.  The war that was once pyro and heavy was now defend valve or rip valve a new one.  Rumor after rumor, argument after argument, it has caused the tf2 community to become cynical it is both funny and sad that valve let it become... well this.  Maybe one day valve will listen to us, but that is less likely than half life 3."
9:18 AM - Vexxes: every game i go into my team is like 9:18 AM - Vexxes: jose.valdrez233 9:19 AM - Vexxes: and the other team is ♥♥♥♥ing 9:19 AM - Vexxes: xXIAmGoingToFistYourDickHoleXx 9:19 AM - Vexxes: and we get spawncamped and my team doesnt speak a word of english 9:19 AM - Vexxes: its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t
"'You were good son real good, maybe even the best'- soldier RIP tf2"
Probably not worth it at the current price but if you're able to catch it on a sale with 75% off I'd definitely recommend buying it.
"You can't 360 no scope people but you can kill them with pans. Some pans turn people into gold. Therefore, you could say that this game is... Ahem... GOLDEN!     Rate up pls this took time and effort    Did I mention the fact that teamwork matters and there is literally thousands of explosions on screen every 2 seconds"
"I played overwatch and one of the things that bothered me was the queue system, you could not join friends in progress easily, the matchmaking often stacked one team agaisnt the other, and there was no auto balance. I promptly left back to tf2 that at the time had all those things overwatch didn't.  Now valve thinks the best way to fight overwatch is turn TF2 into overwatch, by streamlining pubs into something way over simplified. Adding a queue time to a system that didn't have one in the first place. Removing the ability to join the other team, spectate and auto balance all together. As well as removing the ability to join friends mid match, on top of that there is no longer a map rotation. Instead you just repeat the same map you just played over and over.  Competitive is alright but needs fixing, casual is inherently broken. Casual reminds me of the idea of the commander mentioned in the tf2 developer commentary. Valve wanted to make a commander system in tf2 but the problem was it was a hassle to implement and keep it fun. It was so bad that they werent making the commander work in tf2 but making tf2 work with the commander. After the last 3 updates doing nothing but trying to fix casual, you would think valve would realize its too much work to fix something that is broken to its core.  I simply cannot continue to play and care about a game when the company that owns it obviously does not."
"All good things must come to an end. tf2 was one of the greatest games i have ever played. i played this games for nearly 2 years and ive seen many updates and this update REALLY made me ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because it takes forever to get one 1 server and u cant even choose the map u want to play on.   RIP TF2   '' It's game over man!''  ''You were good son, real good, maybe even the best''    2007-2016"
Valve took a good game and turned it into CS:GO.... damn shame.
Gaben's last words;After 9 years of development ''Hopefully'' it would have been worth to uninstall.
"It pains me to say this but Team Fortress 2 is at this point officially dead. After removing the server browser, quick play and trying to force it to play out like the new overwatch matchmaking (which I sadly have to say it does better then because of the server tick rate for overwatch.) The fun moments you'd have after 3 games of upward, then managing to get half the team to do a dance taunt? Now gone. The fun you'd have seeing everyone gather up and watch someones extra rare and valuable unusual? Now gone. All the fun and stupid moments I used to have in this game feels like it has been compleatly removed in this latest update, I am sorry, but I can only recomend this game for rocket jumping offline currently."
"This new update is the equivalent of what would happen if hitler had won WW2       PS: maybe if we all stop playing this (if it's even possible), they might change it back."
This game is awesome! (I just do this to get badge)
very good hat game shiny hats are very good 
Good job on the new update Valve. Very well done.
5 years playing and I still love it as much as I did the first day.
"Team Fortress 2 is still fun.  In all honesty, I think that this update has many upsides.  All the people that yell 'OMG TF2 IS TOTALLY COMPETITIVE NOW UGHHHH' are wrong. I can still pop on this game, play a few rounds, have my fun, and leave. However, the game has also forced upon us the ability to adapt. By now, most people have figured out that the more gamemodes you choose, the less you have to wait for a game, so by learning to play new gamemodes, you get a better understanding of ways to play the game, thus increasing your skillset and, in the long run, making you better at the game! This teaches flexibility, which is something more people should know.  With Quickplay, you couldn't do this. Many people (including me) would choose just one gamemode they like and then not play others. Eventually, you're going to get bored and want to try out a new gamemode, only to realize you have no idea how to play since you've been playing that past gamemode for your 1,496 hours on record.   In short, TF2 is still fun, and this update is a lot smarter than most people think.  Keep playing.  And keep having fun."
nic game like it i think lol idk 
"Since I don't have many other places to rant, I figure this would be the best place to.  Let's break it down then: The recent update really hit the nail on the head to seal the coffin for this game. I was super excited for the MYM update. I wanted to see the new competitive mode, how they were going to 'improve' casual, however the changes made were nothing but terrible. In the several weeks of the beta testing for comp, and the dozen stress tests, the development team decided to change absolutely nothing for the final product. I don't understand how the same company who made the CS:GO and Dota 2 rank system failed to think of the inclusion of placement matches or any kind of way to test a players skill prior to sending them into matchmaking. This grind system they have in place makes it so players with more experience get matched with those with very little, making very very unbalanced games.  For the first week or so, the ability to play casual was basically nonexistent. However, Valve previously killed off the community servers by making it very difficult for any new players to find them. This virtually made the entire game impossible to play. Some simple testing from the devs could've fixed this before it happened, however it seems the dev team is just pushing updates and waiting for the players to get mad at them before they fix things.  This is not how a game should be, the development team really has gone down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and it's ashame. This is (was) my favorite game of all time, however, now I'm not sure if I even want to continue playing.   Another issue with competitive is the issue with cheaters. Valve has attempted to stop cheaters, once, awhile ago. But after that, they seemed to stop caring. Some of the top players in the rankings for matchmaking are cheaters with links to cheat sites in their usernames.  It's not other games such as Overwatch killing this game, it's Valve that's killing this game. Valve is not the company to work on this game, and they are showing us that. People will continue to defend Valve and claim that they will fix this, however looking at the team's track record, it doesn't look promising."
"Well, old friend, it seems like this is goodbye.    2 years ago...This game, along with Dead Space 3, was what drove me to start gaming. Since then I've met fantastic people, some of which I'm still friends with today. I lovingly invested time, money, and effort into getting items and getting better at my favorite class, Medic, even though I still suck balls. But it didn't matter! The point of this game was to have fun, have a few goofs and gaffs with your friends, and release your stress after a long day.   Unfortunately, due to Valve's apparent obsession with money, TF2 was subsequently ruined with strange updates, overpricing of many items, and the destruction of quickplay. Valve almost never listens to the community but for some reason decided to listen to the minority that called for a change in competitive gameplay in TF2 when really, competive was not the most important element of this game.   As much as it pains me to do so, I will now list what destroyed this amazing game:   The Negatives"
it's cool
what are you doing here??? stop wasting your time looking at this crappy review and download it already!
10 out of 10 would bang
Its gud
Hat Simulator 2 is a must have for any steam user.
"Team Fortress 2 is very fun. It is multiplayer, with servers and it can be against computer too! You can choose different classes to be, like heavy, or spy. It is set in the modern age. There are different goals of a game to choose from."
"Fun game,with lots of hats,creative game design,that tf2"
Tf2 is my favorite game of all time it can run on my potato easly and thats what i like aboot it the classes altho are hard to master but very fun to play (except pyro) however since this 'new' meet your ♥♥♥♥ update has come along it has made this game ♥♥♥♥♥ier than it was before i can never get into a server i have to wait about 2 hours to get on one and once i join up it usually has ended i like to say a big ♥♥♥♥ YOU to the tf2 team and i request them to please return the old match making system cause this one is a piece ♥♥♥♥ like the new comp system that im sure nobody plays (maybe)  Thank you Your sincerely Some fuken ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
Valve has officaily screwed TF2. I was a longg time player and lover of the game. This last update made the game painful the play. I think its time to move on. Overwatch here I come.
"According to me, the game isn't that funny anymore. Encountered alot of hackers, and Valve haven't done alot. There are alot of bugs, and alot of other annoying things I don't like."
"Team Fortress 2 is a team-based first-person shooter multiplayer video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. It is the sequel to the 1996 mod Team Fortress for Quake and its 1999 remake. It was released as part of the video game compilation The Orange Box on October 10, 2007 for Windows and the Xbox 360. A PlayStation 3 version followed on December 11, 2007. On April 8, 2008, it was released as a standalone title for Windows. The game was updated to support OS X on June 10, 2010, and Linux on February 14, 2013. It is distributed online through Valve's download retailer Steam; retail distribution was handled by Electronic Arts.  In Team Fortress 2, players join one of two teams comprising nine character classes, battling in a variety of game modes including capture the flag and king of the hill. The development is led by John Cook and Robin Walker, creators of the original Team Fortress. Announced in 1998, the game once had more realistic, militaristic visuals and gameplay, but this changed over the protracted nine-year development. After Valve released no information for six years, Team Fortress 2 regularly featured in Wired News' annual vaporware list among other ignominies. The finished Team Fortress 2 has cartoon-like visuals influenced by the art of J. C. Leyendecker, Dean Cornwell and Norman Rockwell[5] and is powered by Valve's Source engine.  Team Fortress 2 received critical acclaim for its art direction, gameplay, humor, and use of character in a multiplayer-only game. Valve continues to release new content, including maps, items and game modes. On June 23, 2011, it became free to play, supported by microtransactions for unique in-game equipment. A 'drop system' was also added and refined in this update, allowing free-to-play users to still receive game equipment by use of a random number generator.

A desperate attempt to mimic overwatch with the last update is driving the game to the ♥♥♥♥ing ground.
"Goodnight, sweet prince"
I main medic so I don't really know how to play this game.
Best game to turn your dollars to hats.  420/360 best cod series would d4nk sc0pe.  wow this is cringy
It's TF2.
Pretty good...
"I am totally not trying to darg more people into a dying game, but you guys should totally come play competitive it is.... reallly fun!~!~!!!"
This game is Good for Kids as well as for Adults not just because its FREE but also because of its low System Requirements and Some other specifications. If you are new to Steam Might as well play this if you don't have any Money. Thats why this game will be Highly  RECOMMENDED .
"Absolutely love the game. Been playing this thing for years now, and it never gets boring."
newest update doesnt allow friendly players anymore. unable to play the maps alone can only search in casual. forces people to be 'tryhards' in tf2.  edit: game playable but needs more weapons
"I thought I had a review here, but apperetnly I didn't. TF2 is a great, silly, fun, characterized, and free game that is  actually  free to play, there are no ads or anything nagging you to pay; all the weapons have some sense of balance and you can randomly get any weapon. Of course you can pay, I have, usually for the special little features, but it never feels necessary; it's the skill of you more than you weapon that can show how good you are. But if your going to pay for anything, I'd recommend something related to an update's campaign. That will keep you occupied for a few months for just a few bucks. And it supports valve so they can actually keep Steam running, not bad if I say so myself."
"It was fun, then the update came and gave everybody cancer, #MAKE TF2 GREAT AGAIN!!!!! You Screwed Up Valve....."
"This game was fine as it was, now it seems like you're trying to make the game like another game (Overwatch *cough*) But we all know (At least the people that have played TF2 for a long time) know that this game is completely different than Overwatch. This game is silly and has a great community. (Besides the usual bump ins with idiots) on overwatch NOBODY talks. I don't see any Tobjorn's going combat tobjorn or sentry jumping like you can in TF2 with Engineer. This update was so silly. no, I don't recommend the game as it is at the moment."
I don't know but I really don't like the new update because I like playing on map steel and I never get to play on it because I cannot choose map I wanna play on! Also it takes a long time for it to find a game I also got a penalty for leaving the match just because I need to eat some dinner like common Valve!
RIP 'play tf2 to have some fun'.

You don't actually have to spend money on this Free FPS!   20/10
"Simulation of hat wearing, shoot killing, duck raiding, crate finding, weapon toting, rocket jumping, unusual collecting, strange farming, idle servering, Pootis Heavying, Spycrabbing, hat trading, team stacking, ♥♥♥♥ training, holiest of dooliest-ing, dubspoling game where even though you play the same maps over and over you just...can't...stop.  10/10 Unusual Australium weapons would pro again."
 Class based First Person shooter aka Hat simulator
A Wise Man Once Said 'THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT FASHION SO SHUT YOUR ♥♥♥♥ BEFORE I SUCK IT'. That Defines The Game Better Then Anything I Can Say.
"I don't know how you can mess up a previously-good game this badly.  I kind of wish Valve didn't hire people out of debate class or a Starbucks congregation, because it's clear whoever is doing these updates are complete morons. You can tell the love of old Valve is not present at all in these recent additions. It just feels... so hamfisted in there, it's not supposed to be, but it's just in front of you."
"Well, there goes my life..."
"HOW TO GET GOOD IN TEN EASY STEPS:  1. Turn the settings to minimum so it looks like garbage. 2. Get some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ing binds to spam when you kill someone or get killed. 3. Set up a microphone for maximum trash talking. 4. Enable sprays and, preferably, set yours to some dude with a gaping ♥♥♥♥ or some lewd anime trash. 5. Now that you have all your hardware configurations, lets move on to your in game persona. 6. Steal your mom's credit card and buy strange weapons with killstreakers or skins, to make them stand out. 7. Buy nametags to name those expensive weapons something offensive or humorous like 'Hitler's Inferno' 8. Boot up your game, join a server, and proceed to get murdered repeatedly. 9. Make friends with other losers online and, even though you're garbage, end up having a blast. 10. Repeat for hundreds/thousands of hours."
Really cool game everyone should play this!
REALLY ADDICTIVE and stole my money 11/10
"If you're a fan of shooters, but are getting tired of Call of Duty, (Note:I have nothing against CoD) then this game is just for you. While the cartoony style might throw you off, that doesn't stop it from being a fun game. You can choose from nine classes, the Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and the Spy. While you play the game, you can sometimes get item drops that consist of weapons of different varieties of classes, crates that you can unbox with keys from the game's equivalent of the market, and hats, and other apparel so you can customize your classes to look the way you want. These items, however, are quite rare to obtain from drops, and you'll have to get them by either unboxing crates, or buying them from others. The currency equivalent of this game is metal. To be more precise, scrap metal, reclaimed metal, and refined metal. How you can get this is by crafting two weapons of the same class to make one scrap metal. Then you combine three scrap metal to make a reclaimed metal, then combine three reclaimed metal to make a refined metal. This is the slowest form of gathering metal, which is what the community calls 'scrap banking'. There's also the form of selling your weapons on trade servers, or the more recommended form, a website called  'tf2outpost.com' . This is the more recommended form of getting scrap in my opinion. But that's not the focus. To help you understand the gameplay a bit more, I'm going to tell you about how each class works.  Scout: The scout is the fastest class in the game, and has the primary weapon, the scattergun, the secondary weapon, the pistol, and a melee weapon of a bat. All classes have a primary, secondary, and melee weapon of different varieties. The scout is recommended for people that just wanna get in the front lines, and just destroy everyone. The downside to the scout is the low health. This flaw is why you shouldn't just run into classes like the Heavy and Soldier so recklessly.   Soldier: The Soldier is one of the slowest classes in the game, but it's quite understandable with the weapons he has. His weapons consist of a Rocket Launcher, a Shotgun, and a melee weapon of a shovel. The soldier is recommended for people that are good at prediction, and just wanna do a lot of damage. but it's because of these that also make it his flaw. If someone is good enough as a scout, they can just run around and just sap up damage; and pyros are quite the same.   Pyro: The Pyro is essentially the easy class of the game, making up a flamethrower, and a fire axe. The Pyro's recommended for people just starting to get into the game, but other than that aspect, it's not a very good class for people that have a lot of experience with the game.   Demoman: Now this is quite a fun class for both newcomers, and experienced players. His weapons consist of a grenade launcher, a sticky bomb launcher, and a beer bottle. The Demoman is recommended for, again, anyone, really. But it's not for everyone. (Note: I know it sounds like I'm contradicting myself here, but what I'm saying is that I recommend it to everyone, but the class itself might not be for you.) His flaw is that he isn't very fast, and his weapons, while as fun as they are, all depend on your skills of prediction, like the Soldier. That's basically what the Demoman is. Just a Soldier, but with grenades, and bombs.   Heavy: This is a class that hardly anyone uses, unless you're defending. The heavy is the slowest class in the game, consisting weapons of a Minigun/Gatling Gun, a Shotgun, and his fists. Yes, the minigun does immense damage, but what happens when you run out of ammo? You'll have to rely on your shotgun, which won't be very effective against almost every class in the game. This is why the Heavy isn't played very much. But that doesn't mean that he isn't fun to use the whole way through.  Engineer: Now this is a class that has a lot to be said. The engineer is, by far, the most complex character gameplay wise. His weapons consist of a shotgun, a pistol, a wrench, and his buildings that are a sentry gun, a dispenser, and a teleporter entrance/exit. These buildings can be upgraded using metal, not the kind for currency, but this metal is specifically for the Engineer. When you do upgrade your sentry, it can do massive damage, and can soak up more damage then a level 1 sentry would. You can only level your buildings up to a level three. Dispensers give you health, and ammo, while teleporters, well, teleport. The more they're upgraded, the more health and ammo your dispenser gives, and the faster your teleporters cool off. But beware of spies, because they can sap your buildings, which result in the buildings being destroyed if you don't get rid of them. But that's about all I have to say for this class, on to the next one.  Medic: This is one of the most useful classes in official servers, but when it consists of other servers such as trade servers, and Saxton Hale, you won't get much to work with. The Medic's weapons consist of a syringe gun, a medi-gun, which can heal your teammates, and a bonesaw. When you heal your teammates long enough, you earn what is called Uber. Once your Uber is full, you and your teammate can be invincible for a short amount of time. Other than that, there isn't much left to talk about.  Sniper: For all of you CoD players out there, you'll either fit right at home, or stay as far away from this class as virtually possible. But anyways, the sniper does, well, snipe. His weapons consist of a sniper rifle, an SMG, or to be more precise, a small machine gun, and a Kukri, which is basically a small sword. The sniper has a comfortable speed, and is fun to use if you know how to rack up the headshots. The only way to actually make any sort of progress like that though, is to find a safe spot, and just go crazy. Just watch out for spies though. They can backstab you while you're dominating everyone.  Spy: This is the final class in the game, and is by far the hardest to perfect. The spy lives well up to his name with weapons consisting up of a revolver, a sapper, a knife, a disguise kit, and a cloaking device. The spy is quite versatile if you know what you're doing. The knife you have can backstab someone, which kills them in an instant, no matter what class you are. This mechanic is the stuff of nightmares for engineers, and snipers; unless you have a certain item for the sniper, which is called the Razorback, which prevents spies from backstabbing you. The cloaking device does just that. Cloak. But it's only for a short amount of time, so don't even think of trying to exploit. The sapper can be put onto enemy buildings to destroy them. But they can't be destroyed instantly, so you'll have to make sure engineers don't destroy them. Watch out when you try to sap sentries. If you're not disguised, it'll utterly decimate you before you can even get close to you. The spy is the weakest class with the same amount of health as the scout. Other than these factors, there's really nothing else to talk about.  Well anyways, that's all you need to know about the game of Team Fortress 2. I immensely recommend this to any shooter fans out there that just want a change of pace."
Hat Fortress 2
Love it :D
It's the only game you need what more could you want?
"Once you start playing TF2 you cant stop, it pulls you into a pleasant frenzy of killing that you will do over and over again without thinking twice."
"If you don't taunt after a kill, you need to take a long look in the mirror and figure out what you're doing with your life."
"TF2 is your average team based game. There are multiple different classes from (Scout, soldier, spy etc) all with different 'abilities' and weapons. The twist to this game is you can decorate your characters with hats and cosmetics. I think this is a great idea as it can make you unique from all the different players. I also like it from your different qualities of weapons (unique, strange, feative, unusual etc).  The down side to this game is the fact that me, personally, got quite addicted to it."
"I reccormend this game, experiance the life of guns and humour all in one! Be a secretive backstabber, a fast runner, a big heavy sanvich lover, a maniac, a healer, a builder, a rocketman and a sniper. The fun never ends! you can play day and night, also you can trade! desighn your charater with funny hats and misc. Make fun of people and Bragging rights, remember MvM is also a robtic fun! Why not play this game for your enjoyity, Better than others, becauz this game stands NUMBER 1# for the F2p games!"
Best game ever for steam the only reason why i got steam Awesome graphcs Cool items Player made stuff and more MUST PLAY NOW!!!
10/10 would get hats again  source: 8 years of hats
THE BEST FPS I HAVE EVERY
I LOVE THIS GAME!
"This game ruined my life. I never go outside anymore. My friends have all forgotten about me and moved on with their lives, and I'm almost certain that my parents have forgotten that they have a son...all because I spend every waking moment of my miserable life buying hats for a virtual Russian with a minigun from some guy with flames on his head. 5/5 stars.    11/10 'It's okay.' ~IGN"
Very good game. One of the best games out their.
I did this review for the badge.
This game makes my wallet sad.  IGN: 11/10 It's alright.
Best Free to play on steam
GETTTTT ITTTTTT NOWWWWW !!!!!!!!!
this game ruined my life  you should play it
good game snipy-snipy snoo play it be good and be hacks good :3
"AWESOME!!! Its free, Attractive And Amazing! This is the Game I was willing For Years!!!"
This game is just too good.
oh god... this game is awsome :PP
:3
"TF2, Solid, Old, Gold. This is a game you'll quickly get into, and may quickly get away from by accident, then re-pick it up in your libary because it's 3 at night and you have nothing to play, you'know? It's a classic. Specially after the 'Meet Your Match' Update that added competetive. Which possibly means 'IF' VALVe decideds to put in money to some tournaments. it'll get new life and maybe push Overwatch Out of the game? Who knows ^^  I'd rate this game 8/10. I'v had so many fun hours in this game."
Ruined.
Hearing someone ask 'What is Rice made of?' 10/10
"I haven't played this game (for the most part) in the last year or so. I came back just now to check it out again since they finally, FINALLY released matchmaking, something i have looked forward to and eventually quit the game over because of how much i anticipated this feature. So this review is going to be in the perspective of someone who is trying to get back in the game.  First off, what the ♥♥♥♥. Like seriously. You know that gif where the guy walks into a room with a few boxes of pizza only to find the room on fire and ♥♥♥♥ed up? That's me. I really don't know how they messed up this bad. Matchmaking is here, yes, but it is WAY too slow. I have to wait 15-20 minutes sometimes for matches that barely take any longer than 15 minutes. The way matchmaking itself is designed very poorly. They tried to make it make it fast paced and fun yet made it sluggish and boring. Something like CS:GO's mm system would've been better (even that isn't very good but i digress).  There are no HUDs. Period. I could see why they did this due to mm, and a similar thing happened to CS:GO a while back where they disable all HUDs but at this point some of them made by the fans far surpass the default HUD. It really sucks and i hope they let the HUDs be used at least in community servers.  The Casual matches. There are some people saying that quickplay was killed off and that was a very good feature, personally i disliked it a lot. But now they have this abomination taking its place. Now instead of searching for a quickplay match and joining in less than a minute is a 10-15 minute process to join a server half way around the world where you get a ping of 200.   I can honestly say that this game is past its prime and it makes sense. It's nearly a decade old now and is only kept alive by new missions and more hats (and now skins? what??) I just don't think this game is up to par with other modern multiplayer shooters like CS:GO or more recently Overwatch. I loved this game a lot, but i think i'm going to end my hopes of it getting any better. Maybe valve will make a sequel or do a complete overhaul of the game, who knows. But for now I'm going to buy Overwatch to take its place."
"It is probably one of the best, if not THE best, FPS game available to play on PC. It is free, and it only costs 10 cents to upgrade to premium (just buy a ten cent item off the market and boom you're premium). While it is very cartoony and has nowhere near as much gore and blood as games like CoD and Battlefield, it's free to play and fun to play as well. It has a fairly good community surrounding it as well, which is one of the best things about this game. The glitches that people have found just add to the hilarity and enjoyment of the game. The classes are all very well balanced, as well as the weapons for each class. This game is one that everyone will definitely enjoy for a long time to come. Plus if you want to give some money to the developers, you can get some really badass cosmetics. ~Drew"
"That freakin' medic's a spy. Need a dispenser here. Yo, is anybody keeping track of my heads batted in? I'm not even winded."
"This game will ruin your ♥♥♥♥ing life, your beliefs and everything you stand for."
Best competitive game all the time.
I loved tf2 up until this most recent update. This has ruined tf2 over night. I have not been able to get into a single game since the new update launched. Bring back the old tf2 we loved. Dont turn tf2 into counter strike.
"-excited for new update -try out new matchimaking -wait for 10 minutes -finally matched to king of the hill server -auto asigned to team -game is 10 against 6, my ping is awful -spawn -killed as i step out of spawn -half the enemy team is outside our spawn -my team is 4 scouts and 2 snipers -bring up menu -'voting system is disabled' -can't leave because of penalty - 10/10 valve"
"Team fortress 2. allso known as the game I 'used' to play alot back in 2009. the game have had ♥♥♥♥ ton of updates so you can expect alot from it if your new to it. the game offers up to 9 unique classes. scout, soldier, pyro, demo, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper and spy. ech has their own role and sort of an objective to achive when your playing in matches. spy for example can take out engineer's buildings and backstab people. pyro is really good for clearing the path with his flamethrower and taking care of spies. medic heals and has the ability to ubercharge wich makes the players untouchable. the game offers alot of game modes such as payload were you push a bomb to the enemy team's point. capture the point, capture the flag, arena and the game's populure mode mvm 'mann vs machine'. the game focuses most of cooperating with your team at max. if your not, chances are your gonna lose. plus the game has hats..........cuz why not xD. valve loves hats and the game has alot to offer, some may say its the ultimate hat collacting simulator game mixed with first person shooter. yes and no. you dont really need to collect hats since they dont really offer anything special however due to the fact that hats has become a huge thing theres no wonder people would think that. I would personaly say that valve made a great game.....only they kinda ruined it to this day. there are major bugs and glitches. some that hasnt been fixed for weeks or months. some weapons have been nerfed so much some are considered useless. like the tomislav for heavy. there are allso problems finding 'normal' servers nowdays since apearently the comunity finds valves servers unintresting. some do otrhers not. the comunity itself is pretty decent most of them are quite friendly and some may even offer help. if your premium....'actually payed for the game' there would be no suprise if the half of you have quited playing tf2. I myself have found tf2 less intresting becouse of all the negative reasones. if your new however pick this game up its really fun and it will drain alot of hours from you :)"
I dont have many hours on it..
Fun game. I spent several years of my life playing TF2!
pure fun for over 5 years...
"Played a match 12 v 1. Left server at the end of the match, still got leaver penalty. TF2 what has happened to you?"
Cancer Update  0/10
"I have been playing this game for a very long time (since 2008), and it has changed so much over that time.  There was a time that I personally felt like the game was dead to me, there was nothing in it for me anymore. (F2P, manconomy really killed it for me).  But now I have been back into this game full swing, Valve seems to have a renewed interest in TF2 all of a sudden, a huge update recently came out, and Valve is actually communicating with us and trying to fix all of our concerns.  The game now feels like new life has been breathed into it with the new addition of matchmaking.  What I found went away in the game years ago was that people weren't actually playing to complete the  objective of the game, rather trading, taunting, being friendlies, etc... But now with Casual and Ranked matchmaking almost all games are actaully being played the way originally intended, with teams working together, communication, and incetive to contiune to improve thanks to the ranks.  It is great to have the game I love back. Thanks Valve"
"9/10 - Actually, It's a game which has fun and some action. It's full with unexpected things. Nothing to say more. Old game but still a good game. Hopefully, updates will never stop."
the best
I sat there for a whole match rigging a choke point to explode.  It exploded.  I think I like this game.
"Team Fortress 2: Hulk Hogan Strikes Back is an invigorating platform burger tycoon simulator that has very similar gameplay to Minecraft 3: Milkshake Dreams. The game takes place in 18th century Nigeria, where a powerful and slightly mad monkey looks over the land with his harsh cruelty. In the game, you play as Karl Flimflam, a former detective and now a burger flipper for Kentucky Fried McWendy King's, a powerful fast food chain set on world domination. He then takes it into his own hands to invade the world for himself, and from there the plot thickens. Def. a 9.99/10.99"
It's ok.
"Used to be good, New updates ruined it. Now it is ♥♥♥♥ing cancer."
"I' ve spent most hours of my day playing this game. I've had it for three months and I have 225 hours on record. Is this a good game? Yes.  Is this good to have when you have important stuff to do? No. I didn't even like FPS games befor TF2. And now, this is basically my favorite game. (besides Zelda) You may or may not enjoy this game, I find it really time consuming, and it you have things to do, don't launch the game. You will lose track of time unless you have a timer and /or alarm at hand. THis game is very immersive,sucking you in, and letting you find all the weapons the guy who just killed you had. For free. If you want the best experience in this game, become premium. Sure there will always be some pro who destroys you, but with practice, you may be able to be that guy. Play on in the TF2niverse my friends, play on."
well its one of the best games i suppose i gone speak some upsides and down sides + many weapons+great comunity +9 classes +its free to play +good grahics +good maps +for new players it has a call teacher option (very important for me) now some down sides : -cosmetics costs real money -they didnt thought of a ranking system (i know its in beta and i have a pass but realy you need a pass for that??????) -the maps look a bit boring now lets talk about tf2 tf2 is a fan based first person shooter there you can chose whta class you wanna be (heavy is defense not realy) there eevry class has special ablilitys (like spy cloak . scout doubel jump) well so many down sides has this game not so why dont you try it out? i tryed it becouse my friend played it and i never gone stop playing this game  end of review your Apple Bloom
Valve has ruined TF2 i dont think I'll be playing as much as before...The Old days were better R.I.P TF2
So they added levels to this game       cant wait to hit prestige twenty
An American Patriot killing an Aussie Outback Ranger with a rocket launcher and then drinking coffee like there is no tommorow.  10/10 will rekt again
"♥♥♥♥ casual game, not worth any hour."
Brilliant game! love it so much :D
"Its ok, played it a few times"
if you like pink ♥♥♥♥ then this game is for you
"This game is one of the best FPS game in the world. And, this game is much better than Overwatch. Following reasons  1. So many contents, not like overwatch. So, I bet you guys won't be boring. ex) Lots of gamemodes. pl, cp, a/d, koth, ctf... also, lots of maps, community mods, servers. 2. Great feeling when u got kill, not like Overwatch. ex) cool hit sound(or custom like bonus ducks!) 3. Various wepon combinations, not like Overwatch. ex) Degres + flare + jack 4. Just TF2 things, that Overwatch can't do. ex) got spawncamping and ragequit, get sniped in the middle of the cloak, dancing, trading in the middle of the battle. Get cool reflect jump or kill(Not Genzi's E that is so easy. mate). Have a sexy unusual. seeing the raging cod kids. And best of all, Getting autobalanced or get killed by random crit when you have 19 ks.  I'm not being sarcastic. Actually, random crits and autobalancing is actually huge feature of TF2 and no game can do that. So keep on working Valve. We love you. But, please fix bugs(After 9 years in development, hopefully it will be worth to weight(or wait i dont give a shxt)."
Why would u buff spies?
Diverse enough classes and maps that would be appealing to most players. Can meet some really awesome people through this game as well. Absolutly love the MVM maps.
"If you want to laugh your ♥♥♥ off, have fun and just kill people, this is one of the best desision that you will make. EVER."
"very dank, much meme, pootis for me"
"I almost can't believe I'm writing a negative review for a game I have 3000 hours in and have enjoyed for the last 5 years.   No longer can I join a public game whenever I wish, nor choose which map to play on. With the Meet Your Match Update as of 7/6/16, competitive play is all Valve seems to care about. I have the choice of playing in matchmaking or playing on community servers.   Matchmaking I have been supportive of for a long time. I understand there is a significant portion of the TF2 community that wants nothing more than to have a company-supported system for them to host real, competitive matches on. But, it seems to me that Valve and the Comp community don't understand they have been playing a game that is primarily silly in nature. Matchmaking as an idea is fine. It gives the hardcore players something to do aside from dealing with idiots, F2Ps, or friendlies in pub games. However, most of the pub gamers don't want anything to do with matchmaking, and now find themselves forced into 12v12 or pushed up against a paywall for true comp play.  The hardcore comp players don't care about pubs, cosmetics, friendlies, taunts, or even shiny or skinned weapons. They care about winning the game and having a good team. There's nothing wrong with that, but they are vastly outnumbered by the amount of people who play TF2 just to mess around and have fun. Yet Valve listens to the screams of the comp players and has completely ignored the needs of the community as a whole. Shockingly, this isn't the first time this has happened. Awhile back, the sticky launcher was nerfed so that players could no longer press M1 and M2 in rapid succession and do a reasonable amount of damage; they had to work for it by placing traps and playing defensively, as the sticky launcher was intended to be used. For three glorious days sticky spam was absent across all servers... and then Valve undid the nerf because the Comp community threw an absolute fit.   I was excited for this update. I wanted to see TF2 grow, but instead all I recieved is a giant middle finger from Valve in the form of removal of public games. Now it seems TF2 is 'play comp or leave,' and for players like me, leaving seems like a better option. Sure, I could play on community servers, but many of them are full of abusive admins, annoying plugins and addons, or weird, wacky gamemodes that just aren't vanilla TF2. It's very difficult to find a community server that is running vanilla TF2, and the selection isn't wide enough to play on all maps.   This update was the last chance. This was the update to make or break TF2, and for that 90% of the community that plays pubs for good fun, it broke it.  "
The meet your match while bringing many good things killed the game as if valve wanted this to happen! Our lord of video games I am disapointed. );
Newest update is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrible.
"After the new Competitive Update with patch notes, some of my friends say that tf2 is dead or it's trying to 'follow Overwatch in their footsteps.' Which I think is blatantly biased, tf2, since the year it came out, people have been setting up competitive websites such as PugChamp, Tf2Center, and other pug websites. Ontop of Competitive being leaked since January by the Professional Player 'b4nny'.  Another point is how biased people are towards updates, tf2 accidently making casual where you get a abandonment penalty, which was fixed within the day, they get ♥♥♥♥ on by popular tf2 players such as Muselk(aka Muscle Milk) for being 'out of touch with their community'. As Blizzard makes a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ coin flip mechanic, and takes basically everything people made for tf2 competitive as payloads having point timers. Example such as if BLU Team reached only 1 point in 2 minutes, and then got stopped, then RED getting it in 1:30 minute. Also taking a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ idea for weapon skins and making a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ concept for it and calling it 'a feature'. The point is people over glorify overwatch and ♥♥♥♥ on tf2(which LET ME REMIND YOU, IT'S A 9 YEAR OLD GAME.) I still love both games, but you can't just do that and expect you to be in the right.  Also, Blizzard taking their time for 6 months to actually fix the coin flip and sudden death because it is absolutely ♥♥♥♥."
Yay ! The best steam free game ever ?! No more words to say :D ... Counting hours from my old account + new account of steam it gives around 500hrs of my gameplay time :) My rating is [ 8/10 ]
HOLY ♥♥♥♥ JEGAN STOP MAKING ME EAT MY NOSE IT HURTS OW BEN THATS NOT FOOD PLEASE SEND HELP oh right this is a review not a note to the police well.... 5
Fantastic game. Really easy to get into. Even a new player like myself (at time of writing) can end up getting top score on the leaderboard from a combination of skill and/or luck.
Hat based simulator
"After investing 1,000 hours into this game. I now feel that I am able to write an intuitive and constructive review that accurately captures and analyzes the many aspects of Team Fortress 2.     10/10 It's okay.   "
I learned how to be a weeb with the nerds on this game. 9/11 would recommend.
"10/10 420% cewlness, epic hats n'♥♥♥♥ ultimate game for everyone who likes some shooting, be the premium player and find/buy the hats, noscope everyone you see with sniper, trickstab everyone with spy, build infinite sentry's with engineer, be the medic for ubers that pumps you with @@#^#@, the heavy with epic weapons best poot guy, demoman equals drunken pipes, pyro with that voice that none can hear, can't be a girl because which girls wanna see somebody burning for real?, soldier is for me the 1# guy shoot with rockets, rocket jump everywhere where you want (but first. let me put my gunboats on) a not wise guy we all know, scout the really fast guy, probably winning every run competition if he is in real life (especially with baby face blaster, shoot all your teammates down for speed ^^) best game for my life i shall say"
"I started playing TF2 a little over a year ago. I remeber my first map that i played (pl-badwater) and ever since then its been non-stop for me. The depth of character skills and variety blew me away (with sticky spam) and I told myself that I was going to get good at this game. I have over 400 hours on this account and 700 hours on my main account, I never knew the amount of dedication I could put towards something I really enjoyed. Play this game, get better and have fun. 10/10 all the way."
"I used to love this game, but it has slowly gotten worse and worse, and now, this game can't even be taken seriously anymore. Even after over 1000 hours in this game, I am still dissapointed. I will list a COUPLE OF REASONS for you below:  1. The updates Every update which adds new weapons makes the game more unbalanced. It didn't used to be so bad when the weapons rewarded skill. The ambassador rewarded players who could aim by doing more damage on headshots. The kritzkreig made the ubercharge more versatile but gave up the invincibility and made the medic vulnerable while the charge happening. But then Valve started making weapons like the backburner, which has a very small drawback but still gives you crits from behind. The manmelter doesn't use ammo, can't be deflected and the projectile travels 50% faster. It can extinguish friendlies and you get crits for doing so. Then there's stuff like the frontier justice that gives you free crits because somebody destroyed your minisenrty. How the heck does that make sense? I liked TF2 back when the classes were balanced and when Valve didn't cater to the newbs who can't aim, communicate or use strategy. The sniper and scout aren't meant to be specifically anti-spy classes, yet for some reason the scout has mad milk which makes the cloak useless, and the sniper has jarate which too makes the cloak useless, and then gives the sniper free crits if he's using the bushwacka. How does that reflect what the sniper is meant to be: Powerful at long range, but fairly useless in melee combat at close range and vulnerable to spies. There's the axetinguisher which gives the pyro the ability to pretty much instakill most classes from close up. The Pomson 6000 doesn't use ammo, drains cloak and UBERCHARGE, and still does damage. How is that in any way balanced? All the engineer needs to do is spam around his buildings and spies can't even get close, even when using the invisibility watch. Then you have weapons like the third degree which are pretty much just a straight upgrade to the stock. Why do you think no pyros use the stock fire axe? That's right, because all the unlocks are FAR better. In my opinion any weapon which is added to the game shouldn't impact on the vanilla set, so that the vanilla set remains the best set to use; the unlockables are meant to be 'side-grades' not buffs or game changing weapons.  2. Hats I don't get it. People actually pay as much as $1500 in real money for unusual hats in TF2. It's a game for christ's sake, in a few years no-one will even play it and your fancy expensive hat will be worthless and unseen. What's worse is so much of the community thinks that hats are an important part of TF2. It's an online fps, not The Sims, how you look is completely irrelevant. Here's an idea, if you want to look nice then do it in real life where you actually get to keep the hat forever. What's worse is Valve seems to be as oblivious to this as the community. Rather than fix bugs or improve the hit detection, they focus on hats. I think that is a skewed and unprofessional philosophy.    3. Broken replays Every update causes whatever replays you have to become completely useless. And sometimes they just don't work. A few days ago I made some great replays, but when I tried to render then, all I got were error codes. Upon further research I discovered that the error codes meant the replays were useless and unrecoverable. Also unless I'm mistaken and it's been fixed since I last checked, Valve still hasn't addressed the problem of the smoke covering the screen for replays as spy.  4. Terrible players Here's my theory. When a game is first released all the hardcore fans get it. For a while the servers are full of mostly good players. Then over time the game becomes more mainstream and popular and more people get it. This causes the quality of the players in servers to be diluted. Eventually the good players start to get tired of the bad players and begin to leave. This results in an increase in the number of good players leaving causing a snowball effect resulting in mostly bad players remaining. But i really just blame this on valve for not putting enough information about the game out there.  5. Bugs and hit detection As previously mentioned, the hit detection in TF2 sucks. There are so many times when I get killed by players who manage to shoot me through walls, around corners and when I'm behind cover. Perhaps it's the antiquated source engine or maybe it's just the mess that is TF2 Regardless I hate it and it should have been addressed YEARS ago. .There's weapons like the huntsman (should i say 'cuntsman') that have such a large hitbox, letting you headhsot the enemy even when you DIDNT HEADHSOT THEM. A bug I experienced today was one I've not experienced before. I stepped of the edge of some steps in koth_harverst (the ones leading to the windows); It's a 1m drop and I was on full health, but for some reason I died instantly. I've done it hundreds without taking damage and it takes a fall of considerable height to actually die on full health in TF2. But for some reason I died instantly. Other bugs include Razorbacks that you can't see until you stab (something which will kill even the best spies), some weapons not spawning (it's a lot of fun when you try to pull out your melee weapon only to discover it didn't spawn and now you're dead), and clipping in walls.  7. Random crits Seriously, who in God's name came up with this idea? I don't even know why Valve thought it would be a good idea to put them in the game. Random crits do nothing but destabilise gameplay. There have been so many times when I should have won a battle but then I didn't because my opponent got a random crit and killed me. Then there's those weapons which seem to crit literally EVERY TIME (ubersaw, frying pan, wrench, powerjack). Pyro already has about a million ways to get guranteed crits, why they hell does he need random crits too?  Who else is feeling the same way? I'm well aware this is going to get trolled but I don't really care I just wanted to put the thoughts that have been going through my head for months into words."
"Amazing game! All weapons (Unique quality only) can be found in the free version of the account! Lots of fun servers, some with custom plugins that really help gameplay. 10/10"
I bought a bad looking hat with an expenisve effect. i am harrassed by my competitive daily. i am given items quite often. i make videos of this. i have no life.   11/10 burning team captain         i guess my voice makes people horny
"THE TF2 RANT  After 2 years being a part of this game, all I can say is that my favourite devs changed to one of the worst ones out there. This happened for me when the Tough Break update was released. This update has shown us how Valve really cares about it's community by not giving a fu*king sh*t about their suggestions for the game. Not only that, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on our faces with buffing the weapons that don't need it. So, I simply left the game at this point, and now I came back to play with a really good friend of mine, just to see more damage and greed from Valve.  I must say that some developers seem incredibly strange, It's summer of 2016, Overwatch is released, the game most similar to TF2, and what does Valve do? Oh guise, we need new matchmaking, competitive, hats, blah, blah, blah! Not a bad idea right? Yea! But if somebody else would do this fu*king update! Valve listen, come here, you don't need the money from paid competitive you ugly greedy bast*rds! You not only totally ♥♥♥♥♥ed on the matchmaking as a whole, but not made any positive changes to this game whatsoever in the past 2 updates! Let me go back to paid competitive matchmaking. Back in the day, competitive was free, you could join through TF2 Center for some 'casual comp.'. I did not see a single issue with this, and now that iit's for a ridiculous price of a full game, I call this game pay to play at this point. In other words, you have not an access to all features of the game regarding gameplay! Valve, shut your greed, and open your eyes! This game was loved by many of us gamers, and now it's just another F2P FPS ran by greedy devs. Guys wait for a Steam sale, and buy Overwatch, look for a different game or hope that Valve will make a change, until then I am being out of this game. And I can not give it a thumb up by a long shot."
So many hours :D
Awesome game based around ha- UHHHH... The objective.
8/10 pls bring back pubs
An excellent game! And I've also met some really lovely people along the way ♥
"Many people wonder why one plays tf2, when there are many other better online shooters. I simply say to them: you don't pay a dime to waste your time Of course it is not a complete waste of time. The thing that makes tf2 unique is that it is not just a shooter. It is a stabber, healer, runner, sneaker, jumper, builder, burner, boomer, and of course, a team strategy game. It has spawned many internet memes and youtube videos, and has many different weapons and customization items. Of course, it would take hours to describe the whole game, so I will just say this: install the game, try it out, and have fun."
The best F2P FPS of all times. 10/10
Overwatch for the poor.
its ok i still cant use the sticky bumb launcher thogh
I barely have the will to eat or sleep any more. A+++
You're only popular when you have hats
"Team Fortress 2 has taught me a lot over the past few years. Not only has it taught me to blast, tear, slice and blow-apart other players online while they, in real life, take out their anger on the nearest pillow. Its taught me how, instead of reaching for that pillow, to laugh at the many outragious and ridiculious ways that they've shot or hit me. Team Fortress 2 is nothing less, than a party thats gone on since 2007. Even if sometimes , I have to grit my teath at some of the less funny ways I die!  It WAS worth the wait!"
Super Addicitive. Free To Play
I was gonna get back into TF2 because of the new competitive update. Then I found out you had to buy a pass for it. ♥♥♥♥ that
"This game used to be a very good game, a casual, fun, enjoyable game. One me and my friends could quickly jump into but then came along the new MATCHMAKING UPDATE. Queue Times are lifetimes long, casuals are no longer that casual, and competitive mode, well that's just silly. This game is designed to be fun for everyone, just a laugh, not to be taken seriously. Now I can't just jump into a quick CTF match and just get some kills, I HAVE TO WAIT HALF AN HOUR to get in.  Valve, I do love this game, but I do not love this new matchmaking system, it is fine to be in the game but you have removed what used to be good in TF2, its plug in and playability.   I now cannot play specifically what I want and have done for so many years (I have other accounts than this one) so for that reason I cannot reccomend the game in its new state."
:) 
"as a successful rapper sometimes i just like to get away from all the fat stacks and all the women and just sit down relax and indulge in gaben's flagship tf2. this game completes me like no other. i was only a wee lad, smoking weed on the sides of compton with my african american homies when i accidentally stole tf2 from wallmart thinking it was pingas. i was at first dejected, slitting my wrists was what i thought the easy way out. Alas i was proved wrong, gaben has opened my eyes to a world that didn't include stealing, killing, dealing and a life that didn't include, weed, cocaine, ecstacy, heroin, LSDs and wahtnot. Tf2 was a god send which was my stepping stone to greatness. My lyrics are fire but not as hot as the pyro. I shoot out rhymes like a chaingun, however not as fast as the heavy. Im quick on my feet, but the scout still trumps me. I smoke weed everyday but demoman shows me up. This game is my bread and butter. It is the snoop to dogg it is my everything. Thank you gaben, thank you."
It started out good but Vavle ruined it as it progressed. The recent updates are trash and it's not worth the download.
the item server is ♥♥♥ and it wont let me get my new items and cosmetics on im gonna play gmod for te rest of my life
Pros:  fun game  great community  fun weapons  Exploits galore  fun maps  fun cumminity maps Cons:  game only gets an update every six months  you can tell the devs dont play the game anymore  dying community  no new weapons only reskins  Exploits galore  Valve brags about patching lamoa box when there is proably around 20000 other mods that do the same thing  valve Ruins every cummunity update (BONUS DUCKS)
Earth Best FPS Game 9/10
Meet your match update: Removed quickplay 'welp time to switch to overwatch.' Seriously valve you killed off the one thing that is making your game amazing  fix it pls
"alomost 4000 hours, this game stimulate all my gaming needs ^^"
"A masterpiece by Valve Corp, Team Fortress 2 blows Team Fortress Classic out of the water. New classes, weapons, and hats appear to make the game more fun. Every class is individual and completly different from one another. Spies might be Gabe Newell's favorite class, but they're hard to play as one. People have invented other game modes such as Sandbox, Slender Fortress 2, Freak Fortress 2, and more. This makes the game even more diversified and gives players a new experience if they cannot buy the games they originally come from. Valve has done an amazing job with this game and it is a huge improvement. I expect Valve to keep this game up and running for a long time. With multiple matches like Control Points, Capture The Flag (Briefcase) and Payload / Payload Race, It's a game that you will never get bored with. One thing Valve should do with Team Fortress 2 is to add more Payload Race maps. This game is going to be free to play forever, so feel free to get it whenever you want. There are also good features like Trading, Crafting, and the Mann Co. Store. Even a training mode was added. Otherwise, I give Team Fortress 2 a 10/10! LEGENDARY."
"this game teaches the corrupt nature of capitalism, where the wealthy are more powerful and downsize the lower class by wearing expensive clothing , leading to a street brawl in the quiet new mexican town of teufort and some tragic deaths from those looking for the re-establishment of the middle class  do not play this unless you're a communist america-hating superheathen"
This game is free to play. However... You will probably spend money on it.   W+M1GibusMasterRace/10 
Wow.. Just wow.  I'm in love with this game for 4 amazing years.  I have bf4 bf3 fifa 14 but i will always enjoy tf2 more.  This game just keep updating and always come with new unbeatable ideas.  And it's free!!!  It's crazy to think this game is free.  You have 9 awesome characters. Everyone is special.  Just download this freaking awesome game! And you will understand what I'm talking about!
5/5
This game is one of the best and most fun game i have ever played! its not really much to say else then THIS GAME IS AWESOME 10 / 10
"Probably the best Massively-Multiplayer game platform you'll see in ages Team Fortress 2 is a very great game if you love multiple class games and First person shooters. If you're ever tired of Call of duty or any game like that, get this. and play as looongg as possible"
"The best there was,The best there is,The best there will be So much choices its a very versatile game that i have played in a long time, Recent updated always make it more fun New guns,New modes and most importantly new hats(Cosmetics now) This game is very addictive,Once you play its hard to stop Best i've played ever"
"nice game , the update got fixed!Recommend it to everyone besides tryhards.10/10"
"I have found TF2 is almost as good a place to start out in FPS as Warsow. The community is supportive, and advanced players can find it a challenge to work with a team of noobs (as long as you find some that are not stubborn and at least listen to your advice). I love the option of coaching (or being coached by) others. Mann vs Machine was a totally unique game type pioneered by this game and an awesome way for a team of 4-10 players to pit their combined might and teamwork against a horde of robots / zombies - some of the levels are near impossible (esp. wave666)! The game has been around for a while now, but is always evolving, with plenty of active players in Australia and overseas. As I mostly play MvM, I don't have to put up with all the pretentious show offs on PvP, and have a great cadre of mature players that love to have fun but enjoy a challenge on my friend list. If you don't have it yet, get it for free and make sure you indicate that it was me Rusty | SkyPaladin that shared it with you!"
"I liek this game, but I costs me 400,000 dollars to play it for 12 hours"
The lastest update really screwed the game up. Match making is super slow and in-game performance is terrible with fps drops up to 25 frames.
"To be completely honest, in my eyes, this is a broken, unfinished game. Pyro is EXTREMELY broken due to lag (as MANY, MANY people have pointed out), the game is ludicrously unoptimized, and Valve never listens to what the community wants.  Competitive is a complete and utter joke, where if someone abandons the entire match doesn't count, and I don't understand how Valve messed this up as they already have 2 multiplayer games with successful multiplayer. There isn't even a proper ELO ranking system.  To be honest, this game seemed like a good idea, just Valve can't polish their games and fix major bugs that have been in the game for YEARS."
"Matchmaking has destroyed this game. I have hundreds of hours on TF2. It's one of my most favorite games of all time. And I can't play it anymore. Matchmaking literally DOES NOT WORK AT ALL. Community Servers in Australia are completely dead, it's all just mods and fastspawn. I can no longer play the game I loved so dearly. I can no longer just join a normal match on a server with decent ping.  I loved this game. But it's now unplayable, and Valve seems to have no intention of fixing it."
"What do you say?,You just want to play a regular quick match?  Well ♥♥♥♥ you,you can't.  Oh please! We (Valve,duh.) know what the players want nowadays! First let's change this useless quickmatch for Meet you Match (Who wants quickmatchs anyways?) and this 'matches' will NOT be competitive at all (If you know what i mean *wink wink*),Oh and we have changed the match finder to this revolutionary  piece of ♥♥♥♥  that's more slower than the old one,no matter if you have Google Fiber,this match finder is the slowest thing in the world!,Literally! Windows 98 booting up in a potato goes faster than this thing!,This 'new' match finder will take all the time  Of your life  to find the  crappiest  best server connection!,Isn't that great!? Hope you like it!! Sincerely yours and not giving a single ♥♥♥♥, Valve.   P.D:We also removed the option 'start local game',now you only can play online matches  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Personally,from my perspective and with my experience in all this years,this is the perfect moment to  commit suicide  emigrate to a better game (OverWatch) [Come on, you saw it coming.] Why wasting your money in unusuals/weps/hats/ ♥♥♥♥  when you can buy OverWatch? But obviously,i'm just an  enraged cliché cancer  'opinion' so i can't really make the difference."
There is no fun anymore
I highly recomend it its amazingly fun to play and has an endless supply of guns
"Best game i played. Free, Funny and a lot of joy. I recommend this game to everyone to try!"
afther this update.. well... not gonna play it anymore....
Lady liked it so I guess it's okay  Just please don't play sniper or spy  Thanks
frecking awsome! there so much to kill and explore in the worlds of tf2! from protecting a brief case. to running around with a murdering minigun:D with a medic buddie!.. there always something to do.. and kill :D
I Love this Game!!
This game basically Demolished my social life for the first months of playing. Great game! never gets old!
THis game is 10/10 would paly agin super mega awsome game i recomend it gretly
"You MUST click that download button! this is probably the best f2p game, for ex. you dont have to pay for weapons. Only if you pay some amount of money, you earn 'only' cosmetic items, and you can trade, BUT trading is very important if you're not F2P. But of course, the game is NOT about trading but about Playing and killing people mate!There are 9 different classes to play, my favourite class is Soldier, he has rocket launcher shotgun and shovel as 'stock weapons', but his best ability is 'Rocket Jump' YOu have to crouch+jump and shoot rocket under you, and you wont believe yer eyes! youre in the sky if you did it correctly!   Thanks, hope this help, i recommend you to spend some money to buy hats and earn some respect, i did it and its great, you must try it!"
"Once touched , you cannot run away from this game . Truly Addictive!"
This game is amazing. Ruined my life. 10/10.
"Honestly, after the complete pandemonium of the Meet Your Match update, I feel that TF2 has become much more playable due to the response from Valve. Hopefully, they'll listen to the community in the future just as much as they have recently, and allow us to help them make TF2 an even greater experience."
Bludgeoned a Russian wearing a pink tiara and tutu to death with a fish wrapped in a newspaper while a purple flaming bat flew around my head. Then took his baloney sandwich.   Also I was a zombie.  10/10
"I don't even think I need to tell you people to get this or why to get it.  Because almost everyone on Steam has this amazing game.Put your hording disorder here for hats, weapons, and little pets.  I recomend this game to everyone I know and don't know."
Really fun silly game to play with friends 10/10
New update sucks
Fast paced... yep
"This is one of the best games I have ever played! Free, fun, and accessible, Team Fortress 2 is a great and entertaining game. I love it."
Great game.
Boom Headshot! Im Captain Matt and I approve this game
Best hat simulator that I know. 11/10
"DON'T PLAY THIS GAME. IT TOTALLY SUCKS, MAN. THAT'S WHY I HAVE OVER 1,500 HOURS ON IT. CAUSE IT SUCKS AND I PLAY IT JUST TO SEE HOW MUCH IT SUCKS. 0/10 TOO MANY HATS. LOLOL"
For me one of the best multiplayer games ever made
I've lost a year of my life because of this game. 12/10
"Provides endless fun everyday, seriously keeps you coming back for more."
"Easily one of the greatest multiplayer games of all time for PC. There are so many features it's absolutely mind blowing, you can have great fun even without paying a single penny. Get on this game, you are missing out!"
Extremely fine-tuned classes that all support each other making no one over-powered.  Also ruined social life and way I see hats.  10/10
"I recomend new users not to join tf2 in its current state.   As Valve has added the new offical update for tf2 competative, and sadly has effected the game as a whole. In a negative light.  I hope Valve for the best, and that they fix this infectious influence of negativity in which tf2 might have in the long run with this aboniable update."
One of the best games i've ever played :D
Most fun I've had in a long time. This game is great for those looking to be 'pro' and those who just wanna have fun.
"10/10 If people spent as much money on cancer research as they do on virtual hats in this, I'm pretty sure we would've cured cancer a while ago."
"Team Fortress 2 is a great game to play with friends. Otherwise its fun to play solo, and maybe make some friends along the way. Trading is difficult for new players, but once you get a hang of it, its addicting Overall, TF2 is worth it.  8/10"
I've played this game longer than my 10-14 year old self had played Runescape.  88/10 needs more sockhead.
"Aweseome Game, dem hats are too good ლ(́◉◞౪◟◉‵ლ)"
"Great game , its free to play and realy a addictive first-person shooter , that kind of blow up a person type game , really fun with a option of buying for slots to become premium player ."
Grab everything special about an FPS and you have Team Fortress 2. Words can not describe how addictive this game is.
"1,224 hours - still playing - still alot of fun...."
Really fun to play with friends.
Why aren't you already playing this? It's great. Go play.
"So i played this game over 820 hours. I finally got dropped something and it was a crate. I bought a key for like 10$ to open it, because game said i should. I unlocked bucket of orange paint. I painted my room's walls with it. Now i'm making 10000$ a day and i'm successful in life. Thank you, Valve.   10/10 GOTY"
"free, fun, exciting multiplayer FPS  + fun to play, but exceptionally difficult to master + friendly community + many unique game modes and maps + incredible 6v6 competitive play + hats, hats and more hats - ...where'd all my RL friends go?  score = 5/5"
best gaame i ever played love the hats wepons miscs and gamemods
"This is the best Half Life 2 Mod I have ever played, it's a first person shooter, and it has all the stuff and hats you want.  EDIT: oh god"
Very nice game!
"I recommend this game to many fps fans. Here are my reasons why.  1.This game has awesome and fun game modes and objectives.  2.This game has awesome weapons and items  3.ITS FREE!  4.This game has a variety of awesome classes, Period.  Well, what are you waiting for? GET THE GAME!"
Spent all my money on this. Writing this from a laptop using McDonalds WiFi. 11/10 would conga again.
I am spending all my money 10/10
I love this game. So much fun. THIS IS MY LIFE.
this game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks i hate it
 As things stand on day one of this update I cannot recommend this game.
This update is ♥♥♥♥. Seriously I'm so ♥♥♥♥ing mad. Add back the old quickplay. 
great game
"After 5700 hours of playing (all with 2 acc) Team Fortress 2 i have a great vision about that game. But life is not a cake at all. Some problems i found. I have a Negative and a Positive review.  Positive:  1. A good and an enjoyable/fantastic game. 2. Still F2P (but it's not good at every time, because of kids) 3. Monthly updates.  Negative: 1. The Community's creativity was turned down a little bit. (every single update's fulled with bugs [but it's simple]) 2. The game is turning into CS:GO with cartoon graphics 3. Two update released, but no new weapons just reskins (annoying for most of the players and it shows the creativity).  I'm rating this game 8/10 because of the Negatives.  I love this game so much, but i see that the game is dying right now what makes me sad...  Still love TF2 &lt;3 xoxoxo  2016.07.06 Hoping the best from the Summer Update... :-)  2016.07.27 Playing after the update is much different. The game is actually balanced. Not everything, but what we wanted to nerf or buff, we just got it. It's cool and chilling, but i'm hoping the best from the FrontLine Update :)"
"Used to be great fun, but Valve have made this game unplayable with the latest updates by adding a ranking system nobody wanted and completely removing the original match making system which worked just fine. There's no way it will be playable again unless they roll back those updates completely.  It goes without saying: IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT."
The best game ever
Hats. Enough said :)
the game keeps going down hill
coool 
"Used to be fun until the latest update. Now all 'casual' games end up completely one-sided with half the losing team abandoning. Good luck finding a balanced game. Even worse, if there is a hacker, now you can't even vote kick. Valve needs to bring back the old style pubs."
SImply the Best. Addictive is the Word.
Get this game now! THAT'S AN ORDER MAGGOT!!!! 
"'Wanna play TF2 with me?' 'Yeah sure, Orange? Or maybe an achievement_idle server?'"
"I beat up someone with a fish wrapped in newspaper, whipped some teammates to make them run faster and ran around holding a grenade and wacking it on people being a suicide bomber. 11/10 gg Valve."
It defies all the known laws of physics
"I was playing and i was like: pew pew pew pew pew pew pee pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pee pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pee pew pew pew pew pew pew, 'Murica"
Mannpower? More like....Mann this gamemode is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.     
I went on a trade server and was called a noob for killing. 10/10 would kill again.
"Okay, here are the basic classes: -A new yorker kid who kills people using baseballs and soda -A patriotic dude who jumps by shooting rockets at his feet -A pyromaniac who sees the world as rainbows and candy -A drunken african-scottish man who blows people up -A fat russian who eats sandwiches that heal bullet wounds -A texan who builds sentry guns just by opening a damn toolbox -A psycho german doctor who heals people bypointing a gun at them -An australian who throws jars of urine at people -A man in a suit who can magically transform into any of the above and kill people by just stabbing them in the back area In summary, I love TF2."
"This game. What to say about this game. Well, first of all, it's free, so obviously that means it's good. But really, I've been playing this game for about 3 years now and I love it so much. It's addicting and I rage a lot, and I get frustrated because I die a lot, but it's nothing compared to the amazing people I've met and the amazing friendships I've made. TF2 is a silly rendition of your average FPS games, and I love that. I love how you can be trying to kill someone, but then just crouch and use voice commands and sometimes people on the opposite team just become friendly and have fun instead of killing eachother. The amount of weapons and hats and miscs and maps and other things makes this game endless and very very enjoyable."
Why are people still reviewing this game
"one of the best games with one of the worst communties in history, not even a 18th century British anthropologist would do the pleasure of shooting it."
Hats with sparkly effects and conga dances.  10/10 would hats again.
Be the healyman and heal the doods and your doods live longer but if a scottish splodyman comes he can kill you so get your uber ready so you can invincible yourself and the dood your healing so you can kill the splodyman.
Best game ive ever played :3 i play it EVERY single day! id suggest u play it if yo8u havent yet!
"Great hat simulator I also enjoy the FPS mini-game, which is quite action-packed."
Best free to play online game in history of gaming!
Sucked up all my money and destroyed my social life. But I have a crap ton of hats to show for it. Best hat simulator ever 10/10
Best first-person shooter in the world better then cod
This game made me lose my life. It's still cool.
"Don't play this. Do not play it. UNLESS you want to experience an AMAZING multiplayer First Person Shooter game that is one of the most balanced and fun Shooters of all time. Forget the whole CoD vs. Battlefield debate. Team Fortress 2 is where it's at! This game is a blast. I've put so much time and money into this TF2 and it was ♥♥♥♥ing worthid! It is so easy to pick up at first but if you like what you see and keep playing you'll notice that there is a serious learning courve to it. I peered into the depths of the competetive scene. Well, i didn't do that good but it was fun! I have met so many people and it is so amazing to mess around with everyone you meet on here. If i'd have to rate this i probably would give this game about a 10/10 :D Try it. You will not regret it! :)"
"This game omg is the best steam game i'v played it is the most balenced game of all time in steam there are so many things to do like do caping points,pushing carts, or doing king of the hill and hold the point on your teams side and win so i hope you understand what i mean.If you whant this game download it for free and you will never need mony for it buy it now only on the steam comunity.Sighning out"
Don't play this if you're prone to micro-transactions
"Team Fortress 2 is a popular first-person shooter, wherein you can choose to play as one of nine different classes to fit your play style. Thanks to the reliability of the community, it's usually not very difficult to find a good server. You can gain access to a diverse range of weapons and accessories to equip your character with (either by trading with other players or just playing the game on a regular basis) that further enhance your gaming experience. I always have a lot of fun when I play this game with my friends, and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the genre."
"My review of the 'Competitive or GTFO' update.  Casual play has been effectively removed from the game. - Matchmaking servers are down most of the time. - ~5 mins wait times to get into a single game. - After a match has ended you have to go back to the search menu to find another game. No more continuous games. - Cannot choose team. - Auto-balance has been removed. I was just in a game where the opposing team lost the first round, then 4 of them left. The next round was 12 v 8, with many more leaving soon after. Those on the more populated side can't even volunteer to join the smaller team.  A lot more of the community servers have been crammed since this update.  I really do hope and expect some people on the TF2 dev team lose their jobs for this update. It has all the hallmarks of something that just hasn't been tested or thought through. Like, at all. This is just totally sub-par and nothing like the quality we expect from Valve..."
10/10 ~ Ign  Get addicted Become a hat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Win big.
it's probably the best free to play model ever devised. super fun game except when you start taking it seriously.
Probably the best thing since Half Portal Left 8 Strike Dead! Recommend to alll players who enjoy their 360 noscope triples. 10/10
this game is almost as good as elle reinehrs bald head xooxoxox play 10/10
Chances to get 8 weapons every week that resets on Thursday for different weapons? awesome!
"100+ Hours of my life gone, but now I have a cool hat. #NoRegrets"
"Team Fortress 2 is a game that was released on PC in fall 2007. This game is legendary and is arguably the greatest FPS and teamwork game of all time.  This game has a variety of weapons, hats/cosmetics, miscellaneous things.  I reccomend this game for every gamer. (You will instantly fall in love with this game)"
"I bought Team Fortress 2 before hats even existed. Remember the 'meet the-' Videos? Never even existed. This is one of my favorite games, even with all the hat hate. If you dont know what this game is by now, god bless.   This game is an example of Free to Play done right."
I think TF2 is the best shooter for several players!
"The intuitive deduction that is associated whilst playing this hilarious game is impeccable. This is both fun and challenging, which also allows one to customize their players via the location of common to rare items. Hats are always fun, but my favourite has to be the Tide Turner, a shield for the Demo Knight with a turn rate of 100%, accompanied by an instant recharge if used successfully. If you're looking for an F.P.S. game that is not too competitive but very fun, totally download this game, it is a MUST HAVE. Plus, it's free!"
"Team Fortress 2 is a brilliant game. Fun gameplay, hilarious characters, and an amazing community; there is nothing to dislike about Team Fortress 2 (TF2). For those that don't know what TF2 is, it's a fast-paced, first person shooting game that's based on 9 classes. They are divided into 3 sections: Offensive, Defensive, and Support. Neither of these sections really effect the gameplay, but if you're new, its good to know what classes do what. Offensive classes are the Scout, Soldier, and Pyro. Defensive classes are the Demoman, Heavy, and Engineer. Support classes are Medic, Sniper, and Spy. Now this isn't like every other FPS game thats full of realisticness, blood, and guts. This game has cartoon-like graphics, but still looks pretty real. The gameplay isn't super realistic either, I mean; just look at how the Scout double jumps. I reccomend this game to anyone. It's Free to Play, but you only get 50 slots of backpack space, and you can't give items, but you can get items from other players. If you buy something from the Mann Co. Store, then you will gain 250 backpack slots (300 in total, can get more with backpack expanders), and you can trade with people. The community of this game is full of nice and responsible people. You can't play this game with a good team, but you normally get very good teams. This game can be very competitive, but in a fun way. So what are you waiting for? Go try Team Fortress 2 out right now!"
"I challange you to find a review that does not, in some way, recommend Team Fortress 2.   Damn straight it's impossible.   Honestly, what can I say that does remote justice to Valve's FPS masterwork. This is THE benchmark for team-based shooters, which is a shame for other games as it will never again be contested. EVER.   Don't be fooled by its apparent lack of price. You WILL play it, you WILL form an unhealthy psychological dependancy on it, and you WILL spend money on the Mann Co. store sooner or later... It's all a matter of time. Just keep in mind that Valve are gods of marketing, and know your deepest gaming desires like the back of their head. I mean come on, how else can they get away with selling a field of pixels for $100.00. The best kind of treatment is preventative-- so while I endorse every aspect of this game no end, I urge you to not click the download button-- there is no going back.  PS: Hats."
"Okay, I really hate to do a bad review on this game, but it's needed. I remember playing TF2 when I was a kid, of course, I didn't stay long, but picked it back up in my teenage years. Honestly, it was the most fun I had in a game for a really long time. I fell in love with each of the characters, and their crazy quirks, and immediately found one of my favorite games. I wasn't good, decent at best, but I remember laughing and giggling at all the silly moments. Then, Overwatch came along. I loved it too, but it still never fully replaced TF2, and I longed to play as the fun, insane Medic I came to main. I honestly was going to come back. I played today thinking the update wouldn't be as bad as it sounded. I was horribly wrong. The servers are bad, Pyros are more annoying, the game modes are weird and disgusting, and honestly I hate any newer maps. I really, really miss TF2. I don't want this garbage I was handed. Where is the community, chuckling over how stupid taunts and some deaths are. It's absolutely terrible now. Playing today, the spark this game once had is gone. I felt devastated. Yes, Overwatch took its place in the world, but not in my heart. That is, until today. I still love the characters, but what in the world has Valve done. If they had left TF2 the way it was, I would have come back. I was excited for competitive, but I didn't know all this mayhem would come with it. They ruined the game, and at this point, I'm clinging onto the characters I once knew so well. I miss the old TF2, and I would do anything to bring it back. I want to look at the game like the first time I picked it up again. I want to compete to be one of the best Medic mains around. However, I can't bring myself to enjoy it anymore. It's like I just buried my dead dog. This game I once loved, and was obsessed with, has completely given up. Valve, you may think you did good, but you didn't. You ruined the game for a lot of people, who loved it for what it was. Even if it was dying, you couldn't let it die in peace. I still cosplay, read about, and love TF2. But, this isn't TF2. This is some mess that you pulled out of the trash, thinking you could impress everyone, when everyone already was. I again, I love TF2, and maybe, just maybe, if you ever get the sense knocked into you, you'll put it back the way it was. That way, when I come home from a bad day, to a stressed house, I can finally relax, and remember the joy those crazed fighters put in my day."
Absoloutley the best free Fps ever
"Man, cant say how fun this game is. The normal gameplay is fun. I think trading in tf2 is a big thing aswell"
Make TF2 great again
One of the best FPS with one of the best gaming community :)
Amazing game really loving it 1300h played and still counting. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking to either have a good time or to improve their aim.
":404 error: Team not found  11/10 would play another 1,000 hours"
"Iu like this game but Co,petitive ruined the game i miss the Old Main Meny so why not Just add a page dedicaited to the competitive Valve and the weapon veiw modle 'fix' is plain stupid i'd ;like it more if the veiw models wee fixed properly"
Very fun and not demanding when it comes to OS requirements. Would highly recommend to everyone.
"Valve was all like, 'hey Blizzard entertainment, we can take DOTA and make it better!' And Blizzard was all like, 'yeah? we can take TF2 and make it better'  Meet your match, the bucket that TF2 kicked. Meet your match made everything that made TF2 different from Overwatch to similar to Overwatch, just worst. Now, I know what people are going to say: 'TF2 is a whole different game! It only has 9 classes instead of 21 and has more maximum player count on it's servers!' Well, Overwatch, regardless of 6 players maximum on each team, is still a big battlefield,  With the recent updates to TF2, it's practically on it's last legs. Community updates were one factor that killed TF2, with the very disappointing End of the line. And the even more disappointing Alien invasion, EVERYONE was hyped to get new weapons and fight new enemies! WHO DOESN'T WANT TO FIGHT ALIENS? Instead, Valve was all like, 'NOPE! the community is our doggies on chains, lets give them the shard of a bone instead of the meal!' Giving very stupid reskins and maps. Then, Overwatch came out! Major migration of TF2 players to Overwatch took place, and it seemed Valve gave up on TF2 until... ONE shard of hope lasted, an update came out for TF2 saying, 'preparing for a new major upate' everyone was talking about it on TF2! Then, typical Valve just flushed away the potential, making TF2 a bad version of Overwatch.  Seriouly, TF2 is now just a cheaper version of Overwatch.  Now, I played TF2 since 2007, made this account in 2010. TF2 has been very fun, but it's fun disintegrated."
Buyed Overwatch today and uninstalled this ♥♥♥♥  Overwatch &gt; Hat Simulator
All I can say about this game is that you shouldn't pay money for it. Praise the lord
"That game's just awesome. It's not like other FPS where you need to shoot people to be good at the game, you have to play with your team. You have to act considering of your team's mouvement and use your brain before anything. That's really making TF an AWESOME game e-sports wise. This game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as ♥♥♥♥ FFA wise, tho. No teamplay = No fun.  But yeah, i do recommand this game."
"- Wait quarter of an hour to enter match - get dumped on team with 7 players vs team with 15 players - no way to kick the idler - match ends in after 2 minutes of spawn-camping - rinse, repeat  But hey, it has a cool match intro now, so that's nice."
"A lot of people have been writing negative reviews for Team Fortress 2 lately due to the most recent major update, Meet Your Match. Well, not really reviews and more like 2 sentences saying 'volvo u kiled this game r.i.p quickplay i unistall'. So, I felt that I should right a review that isn't just a ton of hate, but rather actual honest thoughts. With all that out of the way, let's start!   Team Fortress 2, as you probably already know, is a team-based first person shooter created by Valve. It involves 2 teams, RED and BLU, and centers around each team trying to complete certain objectives to win. For example, BLU might be pushing a bomb towards RED's main base to destroy it. Most of these objectives are fun to play, with a few one-offs that aren't as exciting here or there (I'm looking at you, tc_hydro). 9 different classes can be chosen to complete these objectives, and depending on what classes make up a team, it can make or break the game for them. The game provides a training mode on the menu to get used to some of these classes, chosen by clicking on 'Play Game' and then picking 'Training' from the drop-down menu. It is very important that you know the basics of every class, or else your team will be cursing at you until the end of the round.    TIPS FOR NEW PLAYERS"
"I loved this game. It was free, funny, and very entertaining. I will always have a place in my heart for this game.                   But Valve completely ♥♥♥♥ed this game over with matchmaking.  Like to play games quickly and easily?   ♥♥♥♥ you.  Like to play games with an adjustable FOV so you don't get nausiated?   ♥♥♥♥ you.  Like to choose the game maps you play in like EVERY OTHER ONLINE MULTIPLAYER GAME?  ♥♥♥♥ you.  Since Valve has given me and many other players so many '♥♥♥♥ you's with TF2, I might as well give mine to them.  ♥♥♥♥ you Valve. You ruined a great game."
Getting to ruin my life. 10 out of 10 hats.
Uh .Thank you?  Zack is balls but Blake is ballser.
By far my favorite multiplayer fps experience ever; Team Fortress 2 is a cartoony multiplayer fps. The number of hours I've played should give you an idea of the extent to which multiplayer fps isn't my thing. Team Fortress 2 is free on top of it but you may still get dragged into paying five dollars in order to buy an item to get decent inventory space. Give this game a try.
Watched the world burn with eyes of a maniacal pyro. Burned an 8 year old kid to death. Got killed by his rocket. U GOT KARMAD'!!! Best F2P ever!
"One of the best Free-to-play titles Steam has to offer. A fun, class based, cartoon style fps that is good for laughs, groans, cheers and moans!"
WOAH HANK LIKES THIS
I spent too much of my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time on this game.
"Interesting game but, snipers' headshots hitbox sucks (with sniper's rilfes) you hit the air and it makes headshots, minigun killing many times through walls, melee hits through more than 10 meters distance deal dmg and many spies backstabs don't register and of caurse the most of random criticals deals to spies (my favorite class).. all these after 9 years development. In 1.000 years it would be a nice game. You will understand my critic if you play more than 2-3 years!"
"Team Fortress 2 has been one of my favorite games since I joined Steam. That being said, after the most recent update, The Meet Your Match Update, the game has definitely changed. With the new casual and competitive modes being added, matchmaking is a bit messy. If you want to just go play a Valve server, and go to casual, it's a waste of time, because besides taking several minutes to find a single match, you also sometimes get put on the losing team, where people leave, and no one can join your team, so you get stuck with less people and get dominated. Another thing, sometimes matches don't actually give you exp. You go through a whole match and do great. and all your hard work pays for nothing. If you are getting TF2 for Community servers then go ahead, if you want it for it's new Competitive and casual mode, you should spend your time elsewhere. I plan to continue to play to hope the game gets better."
Maps and sounds for servers filled my terabyte hard drive  10/10

Its so stupid It sucks And worst of all...    Its ugly    But its something that I will never forget... Something that changed who I am today... 10/10
"The most awesome first person shooter ever!   I started off as a F2P, like almost everyone else. Some time went by and now I have over 1000 hours of playtime and I became one of the many virtual hat traders. This game is not all about shooting the bad guys and winning the game, this game has a whole economy running behind it and when I first discovered trading, I became obsessed with it. I learned everything about the prices and I am still learning new things. The game also has a fantastic community, constantly providing content in the Steam Workshop while Valve decides which content is being added to the game.  Besides the trading and the awesome community, it also has great gameplay. What makes me play it more is the amount of fun I have while ingame. Like, in every match I play there will be something that gives me a big smile on my face. Is there someone in the server annoying you with Mic-spamming or just being a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? You can mute, kick and ban that ♥♥♥♥er, thank you Valve for that! What also makes me play the game more is the great sense of humour. The personalities of the 9 classes are so well thought out and they all have great voice lines.  To win the game, you have to work together with your team. You can try to win without them, but that is basically impossible!   It's the best teamwork-based Hat Simulator FPS on the planet, what else needs to be said?  10/10, Go play it now!"
"TF2 used to be a pretty awesome game. You could just go in on a random server quickly, and play. It was fun and flowed very nicely. You could just play the day away in no time. Now it takes you 30 minutes just to get to go on a single server and minutes to go from round to round. This recent update really hurt the flow of gameplay. Not only that you can't even select certain servers anymore. Valve, I know it's nearly a fact that you won't read nor care about this comment, but please take my word and put tf2 back to where it used to be. If you want to compete against the new FPS games you have to make the game YOURS game not THEIRS."
"50 mins trying to find a 'casual' game.. I want my old CASUAL( de facto ) TF2, not playing this 'searching....' simulation anymore"
"It was my favourite game of all time and then valve destroyed it. I am not even complaining about the last update. My problems begun after Tough break update, when they changed something in game engine and in the beginning I couldn't play it at all because I got Engine error: out of memory. Then they fixed it but not completely I kept getting this error after about an hour of playing, so basically my game crashed after every hour. Now after Meet your match update and server changing every 2 minutes in casual mode, i get that error about after 20 min, so it is impossible to have fun playing it. (my computer is not some kind of dinosaur's potato, i can run assassins creed black flag, shogun 2 total war, and other not so old games with decent graphics and at least 30fps, but cant run 10 years old game. Of course my computer is not some ultra gaming machine, but not so old too.) And this problem doesn't occur only to me but to other people too with not so powerful machines, so valve is losing many players that way. And this is not the only one, there are server lag spikes, destroyed casual mode, and new bugs with every update, and competitive mode is still not fixed even a little bit."
♥♥♥♥ after meet the match update.
"(Valve have fixed these problems however I still think that the fact that THEY STRESS TESTED THIS gives me a fixed state of authority to shout at their failures until all employees at the company cry!)  I cannot fathom how oblivious Valve has become to its die-hard fanbase. The actual thought of them basically REMOVING something as simple as a CAUSAL gamemode which anyone/everyone enjoys is stupid and the most stupid thing since Germany invading Russia. It is clear Valve want to compete with other class based shooters that have been gaining a fan following in the recent months. There is no excuse for what they have done. Valve's lazy, repetative, bland updates add nothing to gameplay and disreguards THOUSANDS of FANS which buy into hype hoping for something as simple as 'Innovation', do you remember what that is Valve?*   I think the best way to explain this world ending event is to translate the word 'Fan' into 'Cash' or '$'.  I digress...  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Valve have many 'fans'  Other companies want their 'fans' because Valve is loosing 'fans'  They make their own games which grants them 'fans'  Valve want their 'fans' back   Valve copy their far more sucsessful game which has more 'fans'  Valve sticks a seagull up its ar** because it has no f****** clue what the fans want and couldn't give two sh*** about gameplay innovation.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Valve have pi**** all over their own face and we are the ones who are still expected to kiss them. I consider myself a veteran (Clearly by the way I have clocked nearly 700 hours on this game, kill me) but also because I have been playing the 2012 halloween update, I have seen the worst and maybe the best. But trust me when I say:   Valve gives absolutley 0 f**** what you think  You are nothing to Valve  You are a 'fan' to them  Just a collection of 'fans'...  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Now, compatition is good in a Digital Media market, it means that both games/companies/employees must work harder if they want to survive the harsh winter. I do believe that there is a difference between competition and CLONING.  Clone is the only adequite word I can give to the new TF2 update, because it is an almost copy-paste of Overwatch.  Valve, we play TF2 to play TF2, not Overwatch.  This is why my bronze skinned, PC Master race finger will have to stay selected on not recommending, better luck next time.  *(I realise the new Heavy vs Pyro update is going on but I still think it is an insentive to keep playing, to 'keep them alive')"
"pyro VS heavy update is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, had to search for a game for 2 minutes, then when my brother wants to play with me i leave a casual, and i get a cooldown? BULLCRAP"
recent update was one of the worst ever it made it so you cant leave match or youll get a 10 min cool down the game takes adleast 10 mins to find a match i beleave this up date should never be done to tf2 and because of this i would not recomend this game for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ update system that ruined the game.
"It is really sh..t! I hate this ♥♥♥♥ing update. I really sorry for my English and I do not want to be polite today. Because this supplement is only anger and pain. Pain due to mutilation of a remarkable game that I could play safely . I could quickly go into the room and enjoy the game with your friends . Now this is not . Everything is lost. I do not know , why this update has been created . Maybe because of Overwatch , or even some ♥♥♥♥ . But I 'm not going to wait for 10 - 15 minutes that just play in something room. Fuc...ing day. Hate everything! I really hope that this ♥♥♥♥ fix as quickly as possible."
I've wasted at least $1000 on this game and still manage to stay at a $20 backpack
"Stole my life and my money, gg.  10/10"
Destroyed My life and wallet   10/10
I really like this game because it makes us to be closer to friends and shows us to have fun but the one thing that i dislike is that they have the same things over and over they should make some more weps. But i really do like this game.

"This game is one of the best game's I have played.It gives me a challenge good for batteling having fun with your friends markatable guns i spend a lot of time on it with my friends great way to meet new friends there are diffrent modded maps like mincrafe,holween maps, a prison break type of thing.....ect."
"It's 2016 and TF is 20 years in development and I don't understand why should I wait for match beginning longer than 10 seconds. It takes forever. My PC is booting faster than TF2 starting match. And the only way for starting faster is now disabled. Seriously, why?"
An awesome game where everything is possible !  I highly recomand you to play it !
If you love guns and war games this is the game for you once you start you cant stop. This game may seem hard at first but once you start unlocking good guns game time starts to get more fun with more kills Enjoy TF2.

"No other game has been able to match mechanics, sound, skill levels of this game yet."
What is there to say about this that hasn't been said? Nothing. Soooo...  It's pretty good.
"Do you like cartoon-ish not-so-violence?  Do you like cool hats and weapons?  Do you want to run around with a frying pan smacking people?   Then TF2 is the game for you!  With nine different classes to choose from, all with their own special abilities!  Play many different gamemodes! Such as: Payload, CTF, KOTH, Payload Race, Attack/Defense, Special Delivery, Mann VS Machine, and the newest addition: PASS time!  With many different weapons with special abilities, who wouldn't want to play this game  And best of all.. It's FREE TO PLAY!  So what are you waiting for? Play this game  10/10 This game rocks."
"great game, picked it up for free as well  10/10"
"The famous game where you're running around, shooting at people and they shoot back. The question is which of you will survive?  It's a good game. And it's free. Go download it. NOW"
how do i change class in-game?
"TF2 has had a strong community for many years, and for good reason. beneath all the weapon unlocks and silly cosmetics, the game has one of the most balanced set of mechanics of any first person shooter that I have had the chance to play. All the classes are situational, allowing intelligent players to deal with a wide variety of situations. the health, mobility, and damage of each class is fine tuned to make sure there is no clear cut 'best class', and in less organized games one can do well with any class given enough experience. each class presents such different game play that the replay value is very high, and there are many populated servers to play on. it also has a very active competitve scene, for when you feel your skills have evolved to the next level. overall, TF2 is still around because it is a great game and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who is interested in a fast paced first person shooter with some comic relief."
"A top game which have turned for the worse sadly, a certain new feature with 'casual' causes even more imbalance than ever before and there is no kick incase of griefers on CTF as example, no scramble to even out the teams, people leaving before the match have started, uneccesary ranks that don't seem to differ on facing more experienced people or not and the competetive is just attarcting more flamers, toxic assbags, hackers, and more annoyances as they can litteraly make new accounts and BUY a acces pass to competetive anyway (Bad thinking there valve) and those who don't even have a phone can't even acces it. oh and still no darn class limit to prevent 6 uneccesary snipers, spies or scouts in casual.  Even with that its still a good game in its own way, funny hats, nice custom gamemodes and so on. you can find fun friends and hang around on funny comunity made maps. but even with that its not enough to keep everyone there for a long time as games like Overwatch attract people due to fancier graphics and more options in how to fight."
Now renamed: Hat Simulator 2014.  It makes more sense now.
"Team based combat with nine very different classes, meaning you'll never get bored. Tired of headshotting noobs as the sniper? Go behind the enemy lines as the spy. Sick of mowing down enemies as the heavy? Be a team player as the medic and make your teamates temporarily invulnerable. Oh, and it's free, so there's really no excuse not to try this game out."
I'm reviewing this game just for an achievement -_-
Rip game. Update killed it.
Very fun and free.
I found this game to be an amazing fps game that dosn't compare to anything i have played...  UPDATE: TF2- Meet your match was released  1) Launches game 2) Starts Casual 3) Waits 30mins 4) Finds game 5) Loses 6) Repeat steps 2-5
"I don't play many shooters, but when I do, I prefer Team Fortress 2. This game breaks the mold with its clever, cartoony humor, unique, identifiable characters, creative weapons, different game modes, and diverse, balanced classes with their own unique playstyles. I enjoy team-based games, and while I'm not particularly good at this game, it hasn't gotten any less fun in all the time I've played it."
"Haha I have no idea why I'm writing a review for this seeing it is one of the most played games on Steam!...I think..but anyway down to business! This game is a pretty awesome shoot em' up game. There are tons of stuff that you can buy such as hats, better weapons etc etc. All that you have to watch out for is those screaming little kids! SO ANNOYING! But all in all I give this game a 9/10"
"What can I say? This game is just amazing. Aside from the horrible community that goes with it, the gameplay itself is worth replaying over and over. I've made and still making many friends (and enemies) throughout my adventure in this game. I gotta say, it is a blast meeting all the different types of people that you could possibly meet in real life. From honest and great people to lying backstabbers. :)  I'd gladly rate this game a solid 9/10"
"A game that has stood the test of time, and even if valve doesnt know how the game works * cough* bison *cough* thats not a problem with the great community backing it.  If you like a FPS with a cartooney feel, but still excessively violent giblets, from livers to decapitated heads, falling from the sky then this game is for you. there are 9 selective classes, each with strengths and weaknesses to enforce stratigic, team based combat. but hey, if you dont like any of that, you can dive into the economey and relish in the 1000+ selection of hats to deck out your merc so people THINK you know what your doing."
i jacked off and came inside my sister 3 times hello
i spent a lot of time on this game. It's very cool and i always enjoy this game. i want only one - more TEAM fortress than LONE fortress.  pvp (people vs people) - 8/10 mvm (mann vs machine) - 10/10 competive - 6/10
"I find it funny that everyone is hating on the meet your match update. I think it was quite cool, a little tedious yes, but still fun. Anyway I would HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who likes FPSs as it is very enjoyable. Also, it's free so it's fine if you don't like it"
"R.I.P TF2  Dear Valve, BRING BACK QUICK PLAY!!"
"Meet Your Match is a Mess of an update, but I believe that TF2 will pull through, like time and time before, again.  Many balances have been for the better, and for the not as well thought out ones, underlying them lies a recognition of the true problem which a great step forward.  TO all the minor class and weapon rebalances, I appreciated Spy and pyro buffs, Valve recognized that pyro and spy were underpowered. A Health buff for pyro (185) instead of or in addition to its DPS buff would be better suited to its current role in TF2 I believe however. Natascha and Huo Long were nerfed and buffed nicely. Sun On a Stick might actually see some use now (maybe). Other good rebalances include Widowmaker, Short Circuit, Disciplinary action, Eureka Effect, Overdose (As a Medic main, I get and like what Valve is trying to do here).  The point I'm trying to make, is that from all the rebalances, one can see that Valve really is taking the time to understand how this game is played.  With that in mind, here are some of the major problems I see and how Valve can fix them.  Casual: It's a good idea, the only problem being it is no longer 'casual'. You cant join friends in the middle of a game anymore. And the servers they assign you to have terrible pings where I am. All the good players who like to mess around stopped playing and all the terrible players started tryharding.  An easy way to fix this is bringing back the option to let you join casual in the middle of the game by looking through server list or the 'join game' button and voting systems to extend current map/match-up.  Comp: should be available for all players who have played above a certain amount of hours instead of just for those who paid for the game. If one or two hour farmers get through it wont matter because Valve could easily use their ranking system to pair people with similar skill levels together. If you arent good, doesnt matter how much you game the system, you're stuck at bottom.  Comp needs class limits. Maybe 2 for each Assault class and one for each defense class and they could explain it as 'to keep the game dynamic'. (Read up on the metagame and watch some matches before you ask why)  Medic speed buff is stupid. Increases survivability of medic, encouraging stalemates in comp (Medics feel safer, less urgency to push from winning team). Reduces the fun in playing Medic because you get to be sloppier in your positioning, less good at dodging which is basically all Medic is about. Scout did -not- need another buff (or whatever this was to scout) It sounds like it makes sense 'travel at the same rate of the player you are healing' but it's actually really gimmicky, basically boiling down to 'heal scouts to go fast' because they are only class faster than Medic.  Despite the above, potential players, dont be put off. TF2 is still a miracle of a game: the chemistry between all the classes work so well, it is incredibly fun to play and getting good is really satisfying.  Besides, there's always community servers to tide this over (cp_orange, jump maps, mge, 24/7 dustbowl hightower)"
"Graphics is very cute , I wish I'd like more games like this,but rather play offline games , need a a fast reflex and good eye hand coordination , but overall its good , ---Miss Kate ---"

If you are just a casual player who wants a game of fun, relaxation or just a good time - don't even look at her. Please. Do not repeаt my mistake."
This game made me forget about the meaning of life.
Such unbalance. Much Salt. 11/10 will recommend.
"Always loved this game. But I have to join all the negative reviews in hope that Valve will hear and understand. It's no longer enjoyable. They ♥♥♥♥ed up one of the best server searching systems I've seen, the competitive is swarming with laggers and hackers, server searches take forever.. Everything is bad :(  PLEASE UNDO."
Was a great game till valve threw a wrench in it with the last update.
ho-lee-♥♥♥♥ valve's really trying to figure out this mess they've put theirselves into.
This game is ♥♥♥♥ lol
"Where to start?  TF2, in my honest opinion, is the best F2P first person shooter on the market.   First off, it has been supported since release by consistant and regular updates from the devs (It is developed by Valve so that is to be expected), but I'm not just talking fixes and the odd new weapon. I'm talking about entire new gamemodes added into the game at no charge. MvM is a whole new horde mode added in just last year that offers hours of gloriously frustrating entertainment.   There is also the hat fad. The hat fad is pretty faddy. It's hats, they don't affect gameplay and are just cosmetic. You can play the game and not bother about them. Getting into trading is a whole new thing that I'd rather not go into because I'll be stuck here forever.   Weapons lately have been a little scarce. Not a single weapon released this year, which is disapointing since the workshop has a lot of promising looking candidates.   The workshop, by the way, is a place where players can submit hats, weapons, miscs and everything else so they can be taken into consideration by Valve. If your item is put into the game then you recieve a little bit of the profits if someone buys it from the Mann Co. Store. I think. I'm not too sure on the whole workshop stuff so don't take my word for it.   Gameplay is solid. It's a Valve gam, of course it's solid.  I don't even know why I'm writing this review. It's a F2P game. Chances are you have already started downloading it just to take a look. I did that. Now 4 years later I'm still playing.   Just play the game."
:3

"I love this game, but it's become unplayable. There needs to be the option to kick people who are using aimbot as snipers to dominate an entire team.

Even tagging someone as a cheater so they'll eventually be banned would be helpful (though with accounts being free to start, even this isn't terribly valuable for someone who wants to cheat with free items). Better yet, the game developers could find a way to *gasp* eliminate the cheating from working in the first place."
You have more chances of winning the lottery than of uncrating an unusual.
"This game was amazing until the most recent big update, they added leveling systems and a few other things that destroyed the tf2 I played when I first got steam."
"After recieving a series of flat-out terrible updates over the last few years (except Gun Mettle), I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this game anymore. Valve has no idea what they're doing, and this might just end up killing the game. While this was, and mostly still is, a fantastic game, evenwith the recent course valve has set for it, I just cannot recommend it, not anymore.   Valve servers (arguably the most popular place to play the game) have been removed in favour of the new casual matchmaking mode, which doesn't work very well, and takes absurdly long to match you to a game (I once had to wait 15 minutes only to be matched on a US server).   Competetive is flat out broken, with a broken ranking system, and if someone leaves NOBODY gains experience or loses it, which leads to people just leaving if they lose. The ranking systems is simply grinding where you lose xp by losing and gain by winning. This is ridiculous and leads to people leaving when losing so they dont lose their xp. This broken ranking system would have been acceptable from just about any other dev, but not from Valve. Remember, this is the company that made CS GO and dota.   Valve doesn't seem to play this game, as evidenced by balance changes that just flat out broke many weapons (like the Bison's main feature getting removed because it was a 'glitch', despite the tips on the loading screens talking about it for over 5 years). Or buffing the mediguns to run at the speed of scouts like the quick fix, rendering said weapon useless. Valve doesn't understand the casualness many people love it for, like the sandvich heavies, or the market gardeners (playstyles that are simply impossible in casual).  It's no longer enjoyable to me, updates have ruined that. I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this game anymore. 2 years ago I would've said this was one of the best shooters out there. Now, I can't say that. I have been playing this game since late 2011, and it really saddens me to see where this game is heading.  This overwatchification needs to stop.   Update: November 2016, no improvements. Still cant join ad hoc or switch teams."
"Years of fun with this game, definitely goes deeper than a regular fps. Overall a 10/10 gaming pick, not to mention the low minimum requirements to play, a major plus, as well as f2p, (plus or minus depending on view)."
The standing stone of skill-based deathmatch reached a new height with Team Fortress 2.
"Burninator simulator 2007.  Best with alcohol and   a Phlog pyro.    MvM is scary because of the monster robots, my dog does not approve.   11/7 would invest another 6 years of my life."
This game is really fun and not super violent. It has good graphics but they are cartoony and do not sport a lot of gore (Except when you are dismembered or blown up)
A realistic life and hat simulator for the whole family ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
This Is a Pretty Awesome Game I Can Say It Is Very Classic To The 1997 Team Fortress
Dont play this game if you want:  - A social life   10/10
This game sucks dont waste the storae you have to use to get it

"Ah yes, a long lasted team based game that has been around since 2007…yes 2007!! And that’s for a good reason. I have over 1000 hours invested in this game, why? It’s because Team Fortress 2 is a FUN and a seriously ADDICTING game, in fact it’s the most played game in my entire library. It’s had its fair share of multiple updates that include monthly events and the usual game “improvements” as they say. I mean Valve just keeps adding hats and weapon skins now…but oh well.   There are a total of 9 classes with different abilities of their own making them unique from one another, some of the skills are easy to learn whilst some take time and practise to perfect. There are also a TON of weapons to choose from for each of the classes which affect how they behave; although some weapon combinations are better than others. A good thing to know is that THERE IS ALMOST NO DIRECT UPGRADE from weapon to weapon, there will always be an upside and a downside to a weapon; this makes for a fair and balance game…. which so far has worked very well for this game.   Objectives...remember, this is a team-based game not a single player campaign. And there are different objectives that has to be completed to win a game. These are based depending on the different game modes the game offers. The game modes consist of: Payload, Control Point, Capture the Flag, King of the Hill, Payload Race and many more.   And let’s not forget, you can get Team Fortress 2 for FREE and enjoy all of this content! You’ll have limited backpack space and you’re not able to trade items to other players, but that can be changed if you buy an item in the Mann co store."
It is very good game this is my favorite game and you must play this game
"Ah..where do I start on team fortress 2 .. ?  It's the only game that I love &amp; hate at the same time. This game gives you the oportunity to become emotionally attached to a character and have a blast playing with it. It gives you the satisfaction of playing a team-based action-shooter, it gives you the chance to make friends &amp; role play.  And at the same time , it could make your keyboard fly right out of the window.  Truth is , like any other game , it can make you ragequit but the charm that it has will always make you return and play it more. The cosmetics , the animations , the reaction cam after you die , the hilarity of random unexpected events that could happen at any second and the voice of characters make this game worth coming back to each and every day.  I highly recommend this game &amp; truly hats off to valve for involving the community in team fortress 2 via the ever-extending workshop. "
I only played it a little but it's ok.
hat
"Ruined my life in a good way, instant boredom relief, awesome hats (wow they are so cool), best mutli-class game out there and so much more. This isn't just a shoot em' up (ok maybe it is) but my point is...it's so much more!  Experience the fun. It's been free to play a while. Team Fortress 2."
its a great Game to Kill time and also Hats always the hats
"This game is best first game you could get, free to play, addicting, and extremly fun"
"MVM, or should i say man vs mum, has potential of being the next child online daycare. thats good because cod is best game ever and stuff."
I'm dude who sold kidney for hats in TF2 . Now i want sell my brain to buy Overwatch
"Highly recommend this game. Great stylized design, creative characters, the six beautiful maps have basically became my home. I miss the year 2007  0/10 can not buy it's free stupid."
Best free fps

u cant get enough of this game. something new happens everyday when i play tf2 and its awsome to play mvm with friends. what i really like about this game is the funny charecters lines and charecteristics. with the workshop its really fun cause u never know what new stuff there will be in the game. i totaly recommend this 100%. this is the best online miltiplayer game for me.
Nope.
Once you'll get into unusual trading this game will start to suck life out of you. SAVE YOURSELF!

"2015 was an interesting year for this game, at least for me.  From being the main game i played on pc, to an insta-uninstall. All thanks to those knuckleheads who thought adding Counter-Strike-like-missions to a game that has nothing in common with the Counter-Strike series if not their publishers.  Well at least the only 'good thing' that this game left me with, is a ton of money from all the useless things i bought in these years, to spend on games that are actually worth my time. And well, to top that, they needed almost 10 years for an in-game working competitive system. Gotta add that one to the 'TF2 Disappointments' list, and the skins too; because re-skins of already existing weapons weren't enough right ?  And who can't forget the 2 beautiful years of Community-Created-Updates ? Cause nowadays, Valve's 'employees' are too lazy to roll up THEIR sleeves and make some original content. So they call up all those poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s around the globe and pay THEM to make an update so their game won't end up in the Gaming-Graveyard. Yes, it's a real thing.   Overall vote ? 10/10 on the disappointment, and the feeling of guilt just by knowing that i wasted years over this sorry excuse that passes for a game.  And yes, this is a mad review and honestly, i don't give a ♥♥♥♥ if you don't like it. I rather be one of the few people that saw where this game was going and made the right choice in time, than keep on being a Valve's puppet, with my wallet ready to pay when they add more useless crates, skins, hats, miscs, taunts and limited golden-flaming-sparkling-OMGURICHBOI sign ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Will i go back to it later on ? Not. Even. Payed."
No need to worry about your skills as long as you have an Unusual to wear.   10/10
THIS GAME IZ AMAZING!!!!!!
Why are you reading this? JUST PLAY!
I'm dude who sold kidney for hats in TF2 . Now i want sell my brain to buy Overwatch
"Highly recommend this game. Great stylized design, creative characters, the six beautiful maps have basically became my home. I miss the year 2007  0/10 can not buy it's free stupid."
Make Little Kids Cry And Then Scream Shut Up U Stupid Squeaker Whenever They Kill U

"best game ever, once you get into it, its hard to get out. like drugs. ive wasted alot of time with this game, no regrets..."
"This game is probably the most entertaining game I have played in a while. It's free too, so why not?"
"WORDS ARE BELOW. If you don't like long reviews, move on. If you do, please take a moment to read mine.  Take a look at my hours. I've spent several months playing this game. Those times I enjoyed it, now it's just another grayed out game that I've undownloaded.  They call it a hat simulator for a reason, it's a Steam profit house when you unbox an unusual and everyone needs a hat otherwise you are deemed a noob by the screeching five year olds or a no life by the people that have spent longer hours than you have.  The guns have their own stats and everything, it's not like your Call of Duty game where it's a different gun with the same rate of fire and a small upgrade from your last weapon, hence why this game doesn't appeal to many of those players. It's a fun game because it's different and not realistic. You can rocket jump for crying out loud, what more is there to say?  As all that goes, the game sounds like it should be fun and there is a ton of things I won't explain, but as I said, I undownloaded it and here is why.  The latest update 'Gun Mettle' has made every gun you owned into a pea shooter or a nuclear weapon, they loaded all the good weapons with stuffed teddie bears and made every formerly worse weapon into a Davy Crockett. You remember that weapon that did an extra 15 damage at the target but had a slower reloading time? Let's reduce the damage by twenty and keep it at a slow reloading time, all while adding this extra pointless buff.  The crates stay the same. You still toss money on those keys while hoping to get a dance from a stripper when you unbox it, only to find the newest crates closely noting the CS:GO crates and weapons. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that means skins. They've just made all the default weapons have new skins to them much like Counter Strike. I had faith that they would keep the game like it was and not incorporate another system from another game into it. Surely enough, people put these weapons up for outrageously cheap or overpriced to Everest. But then again, so were Aussies.  Multiplayer and MvM are still alright though. It's still the same gamemodes it's just like I said though, the games are full of kids morphing into dinosaurs and proclaiming they are the best gamer ever, but some things never change. The new weapon buffs really downgrade everything because now those weapons that everyone got rid of because they were bad, everyone is going to want.  If you play CS:GO and never really wanted this game because it wasn't like it at all, now's your chance. It's a F2P game that now has all the comforts from Counter Strike aside from it not taking two bullets to kill someone. I would have rated this game about an 8.9/10, but with the recent update that I hope stays for only three months like it says, it's going down to a 4.3/10.  That sums up all that there really is to know about this game.  I had faith Valve, I really did."
Best Game Ever and now its FREE!
"Hmppmh, hmmphmm, mpmmh. Mhhpmmm Mouse1+W, mmopphmm mhpm mhpm!!!"
turned into overwatch its sad and i am not going to play till the old tf2 is back
"Recent balance changes suck, Stupid unnessary changes being made by valve."
It was nice to be able to join a casual game after work. Now I have to wait to queue up? No thanks.
"You need to get this game :) It's free, so why would you not try it!"
"Why Changes something thats not broken, and break the game with a system that others have done countless times and have done it MUCH better. Thanks for breaking the game with your 2007 matchmaking system"
Had 100% uber and got killed by a Black Box crit. gg 11/10
This game is great. You should all play it. Many laughs guaranteed.
"ive been a big fan of tf2 for years and i always argue with my friends about why its not garbage, but i despise the newest update. not because of the long time it takes to get into matches, that will be fixed. the problem is that casual mode replacing quickplay is terrible. i want to pick what map i want. i would like to just play hours of payload on one map if the rest of the players feel the same. i would appreciate the ability to kick hackers. because you cant anymore. its bad. this update makes me cry. its super trash. dont even get me started on the balancing issues. dont get this game until this changes back because the game is garbage rn. also i dont like that in competitive, even if you have two gold medals in that game, if your team loses you go down. the balancing is garbage for that."
Thousands of empty servers; i only hope the mann co store loses enough money that from casual players that they fire the head nerd that thought ruining this game was a good idea.
Still want to kill myself
"It was super befor the major Heavy vs Pyro update, they removed PUB's and are trying to make it similar to Overwatch; which is completly the wrong direction Valve should be going in. TF2 is unique in its own way and we all love that way. Yes Competitive finaly came out of bata, but replaceing PUB's with Casual games wasnt worth it; competitive matches are faster (waiting) than Casual, but still +1 rep."
"I had recently gotten this game. And I freaking loved it. And this horrible update RUINED IT ALL! WHY! I CANT EVEN GET INTO A GAME MATCH!!?!?!??!?!? I loved this game so much, and it made me feel miserable having to uninstall it being the only fun free game on steam I can get that my PC can handle.."
"How can one of the most played and popular games by Valve suddenly become a huge disappointment?  On July 7, 2016, the 'Meet your Match' update was released to TF2. Just having been released, this update sparked a lot of controversy. There exists two sides: people that want to play this game because of this 'huge' update or people that don't want to play this game anymore because of the catastrophic changes that Valve has done. I'm joining along by refusing to the play the game anymore because I can surely say that this 'Meet your Match' update is one of the worst updates TF2 has ever received.   I remember the days where 'Quickplay' and pubs existed, which made it easier for me to find and join a game on my preferences. There was no hassle, just put on your preferred settings when finding/joining a game and you're done. But do you think this exists through now? Absolutely not. Quick Play is removed and Valve decided to implant together Casual and Competitive modes, which are both terrible.   The way I see it, you have two choices. Do you want to go through both of these game modes to suffer through hackers that are not getting banned because of Valve's Anti-Cheat system that's failing to work? Or do you choose to find and join community servers that are just more worse with unfriendly and uncaring admins that ban you for doing this and that and having most of those servers filled with annoying Messages of the Day and ads that force you to wait around 30 seconds, only to waste your time until you can play? Hard choice, isn't it?  Prepare for a long review, as I will try to objectively state my views on the game now and in the future. If you're here to put hate comments against this review that puts you too far ahead, you might want to think twice before you leave any comments. I have at least more than 1,000 hours, I know what I'm talking about.  I have first started playing TF2 around 2011, preferably around August, about 2 months after the Über Update was released, in which its main impact was by making the game free-to-play for everyone. I have been playing this game for 5 years, the rest of my 3 years being a F2P player. I decided to go Premium on May 10, 2014 by buying a Giftipult that used to be available for a cheap 10 cents. With a first purchase from the Mann Co. Store, you automatically become Premium and doing so gives you the Mann Co. Cap for free. Ah, it felt so chilling for me. Finally being able to trade and have more backpack slots. I didn't care about the amount of hats, weapons, etc. I owned, I only cared about the TF2 experience I was having.  So we are in the 'new' TF2 now. Casual and Competitive modes are both bs modes. First off, Casual is simply ridiculous.  -You can no longer pick a game mode or map of your choice.   -While finding a game to find and join, it can take quite a long time.   -If you happen to connect finally, you get connected far away from where ever you're playing from.   -You also can suffer from bad ping and fps drops (before the update, I could play just fine.) because the server location is far away from you.  It's getting to the point where TF2 is no longer playable anymore because good ping doesn't cause the problem at times. Oh, and not to mention, you can no longer balance teams anymore, you are automatically balanced to a team. Votekicking is even removed, how much fun can TF2 be now to you?  Competitive is another one that's terrible. You have this stupid ranking system (you can find the same thing in Casual.) that if you lose a game, your rank may go down. Valve is trying to copy the ranking system CS:GO has. Also, Competitive is known for the place of hackers and cheaters ruining your experience at any time. Speaking of which, Valve's Anti-Cheat system (which has been around for a long time) is not working to ban them from the game. VAC doesn't happen to detect cheats and hacks that are undetected. That's a huge disappointment, isn't it?  And lastly, you have community servers, the god awful cancerous servers tied with DarkRP servers in Gmod. So what's so bad about them, if you may ask? Sure, it's not like Casual and Competitive, but I'm talking about the terrible attitude admins give out in those servers bring. You will see plenty of them playing or not, trust me. Normally, they can ban you for being too good. There are many community servers or pubs out there now, are they? The majority of them being stupid trade plaza, mario, and achievement idle servers that are terrible if you been on one before. And all of those servers have long waiting times for MoTDs and ads that give you eye cancer, until you're finally able to close the ads. I don't want to play on these custom maps, I just want to play the way I could before MyM was implanted.    TL;DR"
"The more hats you have (especially unusuals), the better you are."
" 'After nine years in development, hopefully it would have been worth the wait.' - Gabe Newell   Team Fortress 2 is a first person fast-paced team-based shooter developed by Valve Software that combines the fun of killing people with colourful animated graphics. Still going strong after 8 years, TF2 offers an easy way to lose time in multiple game modes and collecting hats.  * Gameplay  Following an old school Quake based formula of having multiple distinct classes in a FPS, TF2 gives everyone something to play:        Scout for the abrasive and impatient people     Soldier for the crazed American patriots     Pyro for the people who like going forward     Demo's your Man for the explosive and knightly joy     Heavy for the type who likes an easygoing experience     Engineer for those that love to whack their Jag     Medic for the upcoming graduates of medicine with a sadistic streak     Sniper for the person who loves following a trend     Spy if you love getting behind other people   Classes have an interesting synergy and counters which are expressed through various game modes such as Capture the Flag, Attack/Defend, Special Delivery and achievement_idle. Personally, I prefer most Payload and Control Points. With a healthy variety of maps, games can last from 2 minutes to 2 hours, if your local Engineers feel particularly lazy. If the default game modes aren't your thing, there's always Mann vs. Machine, a mode reminiscent of Killing Floor (Tour of Duty tickets recommended), except with ever predictable robots, or you can download custom mods such as Dodgeball, Trade Plaza, Prop Hunt and so on.  * Weapons and balance  All classes have a variety of unlockable weapons that change the way a class is played in an interesting/infuriating way or simply switch some subtle numbers. While there's no blatantly overpowered weapons, although certain classes become very powerful for a short time, until Valve brings back the righteous balance. Sometimes, they don't even do that, for the cases of Gunslinger and Splendid Screen. I do not have an issue playing with or against slightly overpowered items, as learning to counter is the reward itself. Classes maintain synergies and counters despite unlockable weapons, although the average public server heavily favours stacking certain classes such as Scout rush, Soldier/Demoman explosive spam, Heavies, Engineer camps or the ever deadly Sniper squads. For a more fair play, there's plenty of competitive leagues and matches.  * Trading and economy  It is impossible to mention TF2 without bringing up the many ways you can customize your classes, from the fairly simple kill counting weapons to the classy/garish/charming/pretentious hats that alter the way your class looks, to the amazement/scorn of other people. The most valuable items are the tacky unusuals, which cost a sizeable portion of your disposable income, but they ensure a pocket Medic wherever you go (not to be confused with a cosmetic). I find that collecting hats is one of the more enjoyable things you can do, if the shooting becomes slightly boring. The economy is simple to grasp, although don't expect to get a discount from other people. Furthermore, it might be difficult to start because of the high key price, which is at time of the writing 19.33 refined metal, which equates to 174 scrap or 348 weapons.  * Closing comments  While being somewhat neglected in favour in comparison to Dota 2 and Counter Strike: Global Offensive, TF2 has remained a great way to spend Summers, one ctf_2fort match at a time. Newcomers should be vary of fairly high system requirements (due to outdated Source code) and slightly hostile environment for newbies. I recommend it as a first game for people starting on Steam, as you can find great friends, have fun and being exploring the community."
One of the best games ever developed by Valve with a major upgrade in comparison to Team Fortress Classic.
"The game is very, very broken. It no longer works at all. There are few things that work as poorly as the people who tried to build TF2's Mann Vs. Machine matchmaking, but the manger who decided to that product it the gold standard for the entire franchise takes the ******* cake."
The good:  - The number one most addicting hat simulator game. - Free to play. - Work together as a team with either complete strangers or your best friends. - Huge trading world within the game. - Constantly updated with new features and in-game items. - Hats: you gotta love 'em.  The bad: - Could cost you a lot of money (Valve knows how to seduce you to buy their virtual goods). - Having people in your team who don't know what they are suppost to do can be pretty frustrating.  The verdict: Just play it. If you don't like it: remove it. If you do like it: upgrade your account to premium to be able to do some trading and to be able to get yourself some nice hats and miscs.
Very good game alot of time to spend :)
Do you like hats? Well then this is the game for you!
"I Found this Gem of a Game around a week ago and my god i got addicted so fast, but then they had to bring out this stupid COMPETITIVE MODE and THE ♥♥♥♥♥IEST MATCHMAKING SYSTEM ever, i have to wait around an hour for a match and now the game crashesh before even starting , Game you were good when you were orignal and not trying to Copy Overwatch"
The new matchmaking system is terrible it takes forever to join a game and you and specifically choose what gamemode you want to play. But other than that this game is amazing. I like the idea of Blue Heavy vs the Red Pyro. Please change back the old matchmaking system!! 
"This game killed my wallet, social life, and any chance of me going outside again. But it was worth it."
I LOVE THIS GAME.Thanks to this game i have meet so many great friends. 
wow when i played this game i was just cast away by its greatness. you can do so many interesting things that when you do them all you will just feel like a total ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥. really. everytime i plkay this game i just want to cry for all the ♥♥♥♥♥ playing it. and the tihing is im so good and i kick thier gay asses that they end up crying not me. so if you know ur a gay ♥♥♥ cunty ♥♥♥ faggy ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥ this game is the game for u
best game of all time i got steam just for this game. 10/10
"'You were good son, real good... maybe even the best.'"
My ever-dwindling money-supply can only fuel my hat addiction for as long as tickets and keys are cheap.  Maybe one day I'll find out that happiness doesn't come from looking virtually good.  Get out.  Get out while you are still f2p.
"Valve, you ♥♥♥♥ed up! It would be nice if you listened to the community instead of screwing things up just to add comp. And this gives people even more reason to leave this game for overwatch, which looks great compared to the current tf2 that has 'casual mode'. At this point, I really hope this blows up in your faces because it seems that you never listen to us as players, even when you tryed to listen and add comp, you still royally screwed up. But the damage has been done and who knows if you can patch this up before too many people leave."
"This game is just a cartoon version of CSGO but with hats.  I really thought the Meet Your Match update would save TF2, but it actually killed TF2 for me. Well done Valve.  This game is also filled with people who spam Lenny binds in chat, that's just pure cancer. I honestly want to know what Valve was thinking when they made this update happen. I'm still gonna play this game, but it'll be less fun to play now. If you want to try TF2, don't, just play CS:GO."
This is one of the greatest games I have ever played
"With the matchmaking update the game became an unplayable piece of garbage.   Took only one update to kill a good game, thanks Valve!"
"This game is highly addicting with unique elements, once you pick it up - it's hard to let it go. The game is a hat-simulating game where one trades items untill he becomes the richest or untill he wants to stop, which is a hard thing to do. One can also just play the game, wether organized with websites such as  tf2lobby.com  or just plain community/valve servers. This game has barely any hackers, which gives off a great experience."
This is the best game ive played sense when it first came out
"This is the most unique first person shooter i have ever played and ever seen, the fact that there are 9 mercanaries (classes) with certain roles, the REAL unique thing are the hats, they even upped the fact of hats and made unusuals (which I personally am not desparate for) not only that there's a whole story behind it including the Mann family and all the Meet the Team vids are amazing, and all the different weapons two."
Yes because you can trade and get guns
"  This game is just awesome, but you know, it's not the best way to lost your 'virginity mode' cx"
it's fine

Fun and free. That says its all :)
"Team Fortress 2, This is a game For everyone to Play, SO Everyone Please Get This game. You Can Make Groups, Find Items, CRaft Items, and Buy new Games, Thank You."
A great game to play when your bored :D
Yes i Love this game to play with friends and to work as a team.
"AWESOME. The guys at valve are geniuses for making this game. You can play with friends, kill people, discover new weapons, and more. 'Its the most fun you can have online!'"
"Screw Call of Duty and Halo, this game is best! Team Fortess 2 is the reason i began PC gaming."
Too much hats 5/10 -IGNoScope
I spend 293 hours on my favorite game and get VAC banned for lagging.  steamsupport/10
"Nothing much to say about this game, other than that I love it and I'm pretty much addicted to it. You can never get enough hats and it's easy to become sucked in with the many different things you can do (Pubs, ToD, Jump Maps, dodgeball, etc). With items and hats created by the community, it is easy to get involved and share your creativity.  Except I can't get an Aussie. Or an unusual. That is the only downside. GABENNNNN!  And gosh, lower the price of keys already."
I have wasted 200+ on this game   10/10
"Sup bros, TF2 is one of my favorites since my 13th birthday. Lets get started. So first off you have to go to training mode. Once you know all the tricks and moves, you are ready to play. Its a really awesome game filled with hats, weapons, and maps."
You play the game long enough to become a hacker or not enough to be a f2p.
"has ruined my life. 10/10.  Some mercs are RED, Some mercs are BLU, I've spent too much on this game, Hats."
Nuttin' butta  buncha cowboys wavin' der guns  around!!
Hat simulator 2014 - Because we dreamed about hats......
This game is about hats.
"This game is really awesome even though it is violent and gory it is still fun to play due to funny rag dolls when dying, game modes, promotional items, maps, items, unboxing, effects from unusuals, and other stuff I really recommend this game to all players on steam and feel free to add me and put comments What you think about this game"
"its free, it loads, its alright for wasting time on, what more can i say"
"I have recently only joined the Steam Community. A friend recommended my this game, and even though this game is free, it a pretty good game to be fair. It has in-game purchases, but it is optional, and the cost of premium is literally how ever much the cheapest item is. I paid £0.06 for premium, and I was quite surprised."
"The Cat in the Hat Game is designed for parents and children to play together. The rules are simple and the game is played in the same manner every time, so children can quickly become comfortable with the game. This game teaches and reinforces early reading skills: children look for letters that form words and learn to recognize words as they see them paired with pictures. The game also features counting, matching, and introductory strategy skills. Since the game is not over until the last player reaches Finish, every player stays involved in the game until the very end."
"You can pretend one of the thousands of fads that have tried to kill this game will eventually kill it, games have tried, games will try.  But Tf2 is a living organism at this point, it has an economy, a modding base that is massive, and is a place many modellers and texture makers start their careers by making stuff for it. Tf2 is free, the content is community made, and theres always more of it.  You will leave it, you will think its old and youve moved on, youll play your new fad games for a month or two,  Then you will be back. The same people who trash this game and say games A, B, or C are going to replace it are the people who are playing TF2 and not those games.  The people who are screaming that Tf2 is dead do not seem to understand that 33 thousand daily players is not quite dead. They want to kill it, for some reason, and think that by claiming it is dead will do so, but it has not, the game is filled with players, its still being updated (Despite the fact all people do about updates is incessently complain regardless of what happens)  We need more weapons, oh god the new guns are over/underpowered  We need comp servers and casual servers seperate, OMFG they added casual server making? What bogus!   This game is great, its fun, the only thing wrong with it is a great portion of the same community that plays it everyday is desperately trying to kill it, nothing is ever good enough.  And finally, this game is free, the only cost is cosmetics, and most of the money from those? goes to the community makers who made the items. You wanna know how many indie item making devs get a share of that massive entry price for overwatch?   Zero"
If yur saying this game is Pay-to-win yur fawked in ze head Yu can totally be f2p or a complete newd and still get killz how amazing is that! 10/10 Would recommend
This game is an action packed game that will never let you down. this game allows you intutwine with fantasy and reality. i really do recomed this game
"TF2 is one of the best multiplayer games around. Its design and art direction lend to its fun and friendly atmosphere. The majority of players I've encountered are welcoming and helpful although still remain competitive. One of TF2's biggest strengths but also one of its downsides is variety. When it was first released TF2 was a fairly simple game of two teams pitted against each other. Players could pick from a variety of nine classes which each filled and suited a role, either defensive, supportive, or offensive play. The maps were few but well designed and allowed players to start to adapt and learn new tricks and skills. Valve supported this and to stop the game from going stale brought out secondary weapons and then cosmetic items such as hats. Sometimes the new weapons would cause chaos as they were big game changers and allowed defensive classes to be better at offensive play. Valve always implemented fixes and through numerous updates introduced more items, maps, and gamemodes.  This kept the game feeling fresh and reinvigorated the playerbase. TF2 has always been an game that Valve has experimented with. It introduced cosmetic items, crafting, additional media such as video content and comics to the Valve audience. This meant that TF2 has always been changing which can sometimes lead to times when it can be annoying to play. Overtime the game has become more demanding in terms of computer resources and seems to also suffer slightly from being on the older Source engine. Sudden framerate drops can be common when it has been updated but generally these are ironed out.  My overall thoughts on TF2 is that it is still a fantastic game. The gameplay is top notch and you rarely feel frustrated when you die. The player base overall is great with a good community, although there are poor players and servers here and there. Mainly TF2 is fun and humorous, this is enhanced by the great character designs, taunts and one-liners that are uttered by the classes. It encourages players to worry less about losing and to just enjoy the game. The variety of gamemodes and maps is vast, maybe a little too much as I feel the game has become a bit saturated with content. It can be a overwhelming at times or feel like a chore to manage items that are randomly dropped. Some players thrive on that as there is a marketplace for trading but it is one activity I have no interest in. My interest in TF2 peaked a few years back, it waned during a period of constant updates that crashed the game for me or caused texture bugs. That however is TF2, you can play it for months and then a few updates will be made that change the game or introduce new elements. It is an accepted part of the game."
:)
Its a great game. I recommend it for people who aren't really in to COD or Battlefield on PC. Also try out the other games like this on steam to! So far this is my favorite game
Ill put it simply I Johnbug1 enjoy this game. This game is basicly your childhood in a nut shell with adult content and some majorly funny gameplay. Myself alone have clocked about 1600's Hours on this game and still find it fun. AND THE BEST PART IS. Its a free online (And offline) Fps With dynamic gameplay and a large diffrence than the rest of the fps market (Such as battlefield and Call of duty). Now a simple thing about this game is it is Free to play and also if you do want the premium benifits it is litterly as cheap as 49 cents U.S Currency
This game is so funny
This game is a 10 out 10! I love it.
best game you will ever play!
TF2 is not like any other shooter. THAT IS WHY I LOVE IT!
it's ok.
SUNSHINE IS AN OFFICIAL MAP NOW THE GAME IS SAVED
"You were playing Team Fortress 2, a fun casual shooter   Your now playing TF:GO, competitive and leveled shooter, yay -_- .   please just give it to the community now, they did a better job in updates.  ''After 9 years in development, and 8 years of exsiting, we just ♥♥♥♥ on it for cash. Have fun'' -Gaben"
rip team fortress
"Played the game for 5 years. At first, was a little unbalanced but it was easy.  Then valve nation attacked.  games take years to play new 'casual' mode guns hats guns hats guns  I can't play it anymore. good 9 years of development to blow it. "
I LOVE IT YOU SHOULD MAKE TF3 :)  And you guys sould make more weaps and i recommed this game to be the 1st recomeded game in the world :0       I LOVE THIS GAME
our lives are voids only to be filled with virtual hats and shiny weapons 
The Gun Mettle update didn't kill TF2...
I will try to be original:  I played a bit but it's a good game !
"This is no longer team fortress 2.  Valve doesnt even want optimize their game, all they care about is money.  This is not the Team Fortress 2 i played years ago, it has transformed into badly optimized cs go clone with hats....   Perhaps someday valve will listen what community wants and fix this ♥♥♥♥, but as long tf2 remains like this i wont touch it never again   edit. 23.10.2016  i have started to play tf2 again to give it second change because valves fixes, the review may change in future"
"Great game :d,only problem is too much F2p in this game, i have to say,i was one of them :/"
Since economy ♥♥♥♥ed most of the people only use it for tradings the sad is that the game is good but it's not same like before .
10/10 would spam 'dispenser here' again  NED A DIZPEHNSER HEEH NED A DIZPEHNSER HEEH NED A DIZPEHNSER HEEH NED A DIZPEHNSER HEEH NED A DIZPEHNSER HEEH NED A DIZPEHNSER HEEH NED A DIZPEHNSER HEEH NED A DIZPEHNSER HEEH NED A DIZPEHNSER HEEH NED A DIZPEHNSER HEEH NED A DIZPEHNSER HEEH
"Update 3: simply fallen to pieces. No bug fixing, no true update (where's the summer-announced Pyro Update? LOL), and everything written above. Good job as always, Valve.  --------  Update 2: simply, everyday is getting worse. No one is working anymore to fix anything. It's just falling to pieces.  Casual matching is still a joke (not a single balanced game), one team always rolls the other one 'cause a mindless algorythm, and the queue time is back to eternity. Good job Valve :)  ----------------------------------------------------------   TF2 is not dead; it has been killed.   Some months ago, I though Valve was simply shooting down TF2 silently, letting pubs being a complete mess, no solid updates, silly changes as the Phlog or the Dead Ringer.  After the last 'update', it has been proved. Nobody can be so 'poorly clever' to see that Comp Beta didn't work at all, and still apply the SAME logic to PUBS.  Funny thing, Pubs are STILL a mess, you CAN'T find a decent (= balanced = funny) match in every 20 (TWENTY), and now you also have to wait 5-10 minutes or more every time. Good job, Blizzard. ...I mean, Valve."
"That game is awesome, its like a hard drug and when you are playing it, after a short period of time its controling you and your life. its your life. This game is so much fun :) TF2 f2p for everyone !!!! :D"
"This was my favorite game. It was my favorite game to play at any time, regardless of how I was feeling, what kind of day I had, whatever. It was easy to pick up, jump into, hang out in. With the Meet Your Match update, all of those things changed for me, and as far as I'm aware, also changed for the people I always looked forward to playing with. The game is, in a very real sense of the word, ruined for me.   People who disagree with this feeling seem to think that because it's free to play, you as the consumer shouldn't have a right to even have feelings about the status or structure of the game. That because you can still technically play it, you don't get to complain. Here, eat this disgusting food, it's free. You'll take it, and you'll like it. That's pretty small and gross of you guys.   I keep reading that this all won't matter, that 'they're working on it,' that it'll all be fixed in the next update. My experience with updates has not been great. Anyone who says they've all been fantastic is absolutely a liar. And seriously, the game was so good. So what they're 'working on' is fixing something that wasn't broken, but is. We needed an update, something to freshen things up. Like how you might move furniture around a room, or reorganize your bookshelf. Valve basically opened a window, chucked the whole living room out, and asked us to get comfy.  The other thing I see happening is that others who are not palpably upset by the changes will post a lot of 'it could be worse' scenarios. I don't see how. You wait in queue for an extremely long time. To play in a server jammed with far too many players for the map size. No autobalance occcurs to make up for players that have left, so inevitably, it's 24 on 6, and there's no way anyone with even the smallest sense of fairness or proportion could see that as 'fun.' It's not a wacky induction of chaos as a new mechanic. It's disappointing, and tedious.   It could be worse. Gabe Newell could be sending drones to your home to give you papercuts between your fingers in the night."
"AWESOME GAME! Been playing for years now, and the new updates are gonna make things even better! Even if you get bored of the standard modes, there are many modifications and custom servers with custom maps/modes to keep you busy for hours more! Maybe not as friendly for beginners with the removal of quickplay, but the game itself is still great fun, with the wide variety of challenges posed every game!"
"Bring. back. autobalance. (I just had a game where I was on a team with 3 other people and the enemy team had 12 players) Valve, you have ♥♥♥♥ed up TF2 and therefore left me and other players angry. ♥♥♥♥ you."

Its better than it looks
"To Be Honest, I love this go soooooo much, I still play it to this day, but the thing is, vavle doesn't care about their own game. Its so sad to see one of the best team based game (in my Opinion) be constantly rejected, Valve, if you're reading this, then please take 15 mins out of your time and play the game. Valve please... PLAY YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING GAME"
"Cracked version runs better than the updated and original version. What I can say: I can't play.  *Graphics: updated *Framework, etc: installed *Check the forum: yes I do, I have checked it out. *Almost 1 year.  The game is Good, so I will recommend this game. It just doesn't work with some notebooks."
"Remember when this game was good? Remember when there was less 'pay for everything' and more 'play for everything?'  Ah, memories.  I sort of quit this game a while ago, but I decided to come back to see if Valve had put any more effort into it.  Lord, was I wrong.  I have trined, since the Gun Mettle update, to tell myself 'Its not becoming CS:GO. Maybe they will add more stuff in the next update!' But, nope.  The game was ruined COMPLETELY by this whole 'matchmaking' crap. I would absolutely recommend this, a year ago. Not anymore.  Matchmaking is terribly overrated, its not well executed, and EVERYTHING in the game is pay-to-play. The game is free, the toxic community is free, to.  I wish I could recommend this. I really do. TF2 aint what it once was.  Sweet memories."
Good game if you need any weapon form this game send me a trade offer selling for 1 scrap per weapon;   https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=192994840&amp;token=FpaGIqBa 
"Latest update ♥♥♥♥ed the game up, Valve removed the option to search for no random crit servers, autobalance is not a thing anymore on Casual servers (which are required for gaining XP) so one team often ends up being few players short compared to the other one."

"When you hear Team Fortress 2, you think of just casual play...not 'LOOK AT THIS HARDCORE COMPETITIVENESS VIBE WE GOT GOING ON, ♥♥♥♥ YEAH I JERK OFF WITH SANDPAPER'. It's just a mess honestly, the comp community is mostly garbage, it doesn't deserve this much attention."

My favorite Kanye is Kanye West because he can Kanye jump from one Kanye to another Kanye. He also uses the (in my opinion) the best secondary Kanye: The Kanye. Kanye West has proven to be the most Kanyeest Kanye you can ever Kanye because his cosmetics are so Kanye. I personally use the 'Best in the Kanye West' and the 'West Kanye' in my Kanye slot. Overall Kanye West has given me much Kanye in Kanye Fortress 2.   Kanye/Kanye would Kanye again.
Best free to play game ever! 9 different classes for you to choose from and loads of gamemodes for you to play! Go ahead and have fun!! :)
"I love this game and I don't know why. I've been addicted since day one, and I haven't stopped loving it ever since. With cartoon violence, lots of blood and gibbing, its not really for children. But than again, CoD isen't as well. So me with around 1500 hours I'd say this game is amazing, and you should get it."
Done I Have Nothing To Say Best Game Since 1001. I Have Nothing. 
game is mad cash money $$$ sweg yo
This game used to be good. The newest updates ruined it.  RIP Team Fortress 2  2007-2015
This game is my favorite game in the whole world i play it a long time now and i rlly loved it hope to wont close this game try to make more weapons to the game(please more for engi)just kidding love u valve and love u steam for letting me play this game
Yes I would recommend this game to many people it's free to either way try it xD.
"Honestly, you really can't enjoy this game anymore if you once did. Valve completly f**ked it over with MYM I can't play pubs anymore, without haveing to wait 5 minutes between every 2-3 dam rounds, where I'm kinda forced to play the game like a tryhard, becuase if you try to have fun, people loose their ♥♥♥♥, or the other team still tryhards and kills you to farm points for the stupid xp system, its not about fun anymore, its about the xp. The tf2 Economy used to be better, decent atleast before Gun mettle, after valve decided it was a good idea to add stupid tiers on hats and skins, making items rarer to get, and artificially increasing or lowering the prices even if they were ugly or sick (I hate it in CSGO aswell) The community has become more toxic over the last few years, you will find atleast 1 cancerous kid spamming meme binds or having meme names. Trading people have become either more stupid or more greedy ;'i giiv u 10 keys 4 ur 50 key unusual ye? not even gud hat lol' The only enjoyable place I find in TF2 are on silly servers (If no d**k kills everyone) and on TF2Center (yes, tf2c-ancer). even though people can be toxic on it, I still enjoy it more than casual, where there's a reason to tryhard Valve just don't seem capable of understanding what the community wants, they just seem lazy, and try to implement new ways on making money, and turning it into a mainstream FPS game"
"Best Game Ever , Get It Now , And To Noobies Just DOnt Care What Others Think ABout You Just Play the Game , Playing The Game Makes You better Not The Hats"
"It was a good game till the skins started coming out, I dont really play this game at all but when I do im rocket jumping/Sticky Jumping."
"-rep use to be a good casual game now its just a dead meme i miss the days of easy playing not giving a ♥♥♥♥ running around spamming putis and partyin with the enemy team. honestly wtf happend this game isnt tf2 anymore all the OGs i use to play it with hate it now, im uninstalling for good, i hate the new ui. competitive try hards are what ruined this game. valve pls make tf2 classic or something i miss this game alot and want to play it but the cummunity thats survived this long is completely toxic try hards that have wasted over 1000$ on this game the other half are hackers that dont care about getting vacced on a free to play game. valve pls roleback this game to 2014."
"Community is ♥♥♥♥, game itself is good, any moron can abuse the votekick command, VAC bans work very well (sarcasm) all in all, game is not worth spending money on."
"this game is kind of like eating a girl out its fun when you start it but then you start getting numb and your mouth tastes bad because shes been eaten out by like a million other people who dont wash their teeth and you dont like the way she shaves her pubes and why dont the carpets match the drapes why??  ok yea this game is really garbage, nothing can salvage this."
Team Fortress: Global Offensive.
"Really?, just why though.   TF2 is already fine with its previous updates and so and this 'Major update' is just a failure, people told me they dont get exp and i get some?, why it does not make sense and its just casual, CASUAL. why even add matchmaking for CASUAL, you would've gotten good feedbacks if it weren't for this update, penalties when you leave the game, such as any other game with matchmaking  So, whats the point of the update if you're gonna ruins people way of playing?"
"The game is on it's dying breath.   Valve says they would listen to the TF2 community, but I think they are not. They removed the good old Valve servers. More hackers than ever started to pop up. Thanks for that 1 banwave Valve, you really did the community a favor. Idiots. Community demands new weapons. What we get:  - A 'neato' update that made the regular player like me, leave ♥♥♥♥ing game.  - Broken comp Mode  - Remove Valve server and rename it to Casual mode and throw you into a stupid 5 min. queue.  I defended TF2 for overwatch for so long now.  I am just gonna leave. And watch how valve listens to their community and let them down again."
2007:tf2 dead 2009:tf2 dead 2011:tf2 dead 2012:tf2 dead 2016:tf2 dead 2145:tf2 dead 
i mean you dont log 3000 hours into a bad game
I regret spending time and money on this game I am warning all who want to pay money for hats or something that it is hard to stop spending money. Oh and Good job Valve on Meet Your Match you ruined the game.
Team Fortness 2 got dominated by L M A O B O X and money
"Basically how this game works:  1. You buy a hat with real money 2. You get a hat 3. You sell a hat 4. You buy a hat 5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you get bored, or, more likely, die."
TF2 is a great game that everyone should have. It is the reason I got Steam.
its sh it
" Nine years in development, nine years post launch."
"I really like this game, right now it's garbage, but in the end, maybe it'll be better.  At this point in time I'm not reccomending it, since there are many issues, so wait a bit to see if it gets any good. "
TF2 The Best game in the world.
"Not your everyday, run-of-the-mill FPS - Exciting (and somewhat addictive), Team Fortress 2 is a must-play!"
"i think this game needs alot of practice and learning to be fully apreacated as the obsevise-compuslive spending simulator it is. really i dont think cosmetics are as important to gameplay unless through the community. the only redeaming quality is ,well, the quality! the gameplay is real smooth and, well, addicting and fun! i dont think spending money or 'scamming' or trading is all that important, but when you play this you can hear and smell the effort and time put in to make this game a working, fun, and overall great gaming experiance, the community can be harsh at moments but usually you can make real friends (unless your a ♥♥♥♥)."
"Ok. So after having over 1000 hours on Team Fortress 2. Yes im still enjoying it, but not as much as i did with i first started playing, Why you may ask. Well is because 90% of the community are utter ♥♥♥♥♥. All they seem to care about is who has the better hat or how much is this or that worth. The remaining 10% are split into another 2 smaller catagories 5% being new and not knowing about the massive trading economy that this game has and the other 5% just generally not caring about it. I will still recommend Team Fortress 2, Its a free game that is enjoyable to play, but you lose intrest eventually when you realise what the community is like."
This game is absolute trash. It has a pay-to-win formula as it's main feature. Team Fortress 2 should be renamed to Meme Fortress Dead. There are barely 10 servers around. Hats are the only draw to this game. Players who spend the most money are heavily rewarded by the devs.
"Hats, hats with effects, painted hats, hats on hats.  10/10"
"I played this for over 2 years and haven't reviewed it yet? Even after getting 100% achievements?! WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?!?!?!?!   Anywho, your one-stop shop for all your multi-player needs. A team-based game that turns into a free-for-all 3 minutes into the match.  After months of playing and getting bad drops, you'll want better hats. You'll go to trade servers..... a lot.....   Then it'll be a game about Hats, Trading, Rocket Jumping, Backstabs, Sniped Headshots, and Lazy Engineers.   Well recommended."
It's... a good game... Pile of Community!
so many hours of my life spent in this game and the only thing im good at is spamming the 'Thanks' voice command
The new UI is terrible......
"This game used to be a good game, but when they said go to hell to the mods, community servers and then forced competitive down our throats, saying we can only play competitive or 'casual' where you basically wait 30+ minutes to join a 5 minute game and get steam rolled.  Welcome to team fortress 2.  Find a new game, this has gone to hell, and I do not recommend it for the time being.  Good day."
"I love TF2, I really do. I mean I love the game so much it's the game that singlehandedly made me love FPS games as well as PC gaming which makes it REALLY hard to give it a negetive review but I can't stand it any longer. In short I feel as though its fallen apart as of late. This most recent update was a disaster, comp. mode was a ♥♥♥♥ show and casual killed the unique charm that random pubs had and replaced it with a bunch fo nameless randos going for kills over a good time. By no means did I love friendlies but they added a special charm that other games just couldn't match. The worst part is that the TF2 team is just content with how the game is now, a lifeless husk of a game losing thousands of players by the day. I will never regret having spent so long playing TF2, it truely is, was, and always will be a great game it just isn't the same anymore, change is good but only when it's good.  TL;DR: TF2 lost it's unique charm, now it's just a less polished Overwatch. If you're looking for a teambased shooter give that a try, TF2 isn't what it used to be anymore."
Why waste 60 dollars on a game when you have this masterpiece for free?!
"I played it for a little bit, it's pretty good."
Best Keybind Simulator on the Market 10/10
"Well... It's free to play. Might as well download it. But seriously, one of my top 5 favorite FPS games!"
black people
Since the 'meet your match update' they really make it a pay to win game everything what fun was is now stupid they really make this game not fun anymore
There is no teamwork here. Huge fortreses tho.
Most enjoyable portion of game destroyed
it's good but the recent updates and lack of new weapons are forcing me to downvote this game
I've spent more playtime hours in finding a match than playing as heavy
The new update is just crap. It makes everything more complicated for no reason. Who wanted Competetiv in this game? Its a great CASUAL game. Notcie how i wrote CASUAL. Please just delete all the Changes that you made and the Game will be great again.
Great game if you like collecting hats.
Tf2 is now dead overwach kill tf2 and cs go update in tf2 is a big ♥♥♥♥ really volvo remove this f*****g update 
So many F2P's wearing their '' cool '' gibus ._.
it's good but the recent updates and lack of new weapons are forcing me to downvote this game
Best first person shooter
I've owned this game a few years actually. I've only played it frequently the last couple weeks. Why haven't I played this more? Love it.  11/9 would pay for it if it wasn't free to play. Thanks Valve.
It's not like I like this game or anything... ( ´◔ ‸◔`)
gr8. game would give gabe more money
"Pros and Cons.  PROS: 1: At one point this was my favorite game of all time  2: Cartoonish graphics that step away from gritty reality shooters  3: Active community  4: Encourages teamwork to win the match  CONS: 1: Lack of anything new  2: Valve now treats the community like walking wallets  3: The newest weapons are over a year old  4: No matter how good you may be at the game, no hats, you suck at TF2  5: Terrible community  6: Updates are twice yearly, usually now failing to bring anything good  7: Instead of simply adding hats to the game store where you can freely choose what you want, you now have to find crates, buy keys ($2.50 per key), and it's completely random. Got a hat you don't like? Too bad, repeat the process and give us more money so we can keep doing this. And while you're doing this, you'll get even more hats you don't like or want!  8: Quickplay has been completely removed in favor of waiting 5-10 minutes for ONE MATCH  9: Now you and your team are penalized for one person a leaving a match  10: Completely stupid ranking system has been added which makes experienced players like me feel like noobs again  11: You can't choose what map to play on anymore, put on a map you don't like? TOO BAD! You now either endure the map and hope to be put on one you like, or leave and wait another 5-10 minutes for another round of this bs   OVERALL SCORE: 2/10  R.I.P Team Fortress 2. 2007-2016"
If you like hats this is the game for you.
This game is ♥♥♥♥. Okay? It sucks. So I recomend you play it.
"Free,fun and Fantastic this game beats all other FPS'"
"'Roses are red Violets are blue I hate the new update of Team Fortress 2' - My friend Metan.  AND I AGREE, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO TF2 ;_; who let them ruin such a great game? "
"Think about a multiplayer game. It has weapons, it has different classes, it has different abilities for every classes, different weapons for every classes, it has different modes, special events, many many maps for multiplayer, it has pretty fun co-op mode, it has customization (which is not affecting game balance at all). And everything about characters, TF2 universe is hillarious. This game has everything. Just give it a little time, then you will not able to stop playing it. I guarantee it."
wtf i cant shoot through windows activision pls fix this game or i quit 123
"Best game to spend the time on. Allmost no bugs. Classes are fun to play. Weapons are balanced. Mass multiplayer. Allmost no hackers. Helpful and friendly community. You can trade cool weapons, miscs, hats (that may take a lot of your money). Fun events like Halloween, TF2 Birthday and many more! Many and i mean MANY gamemodes and maps! You can create your own hats, miscs, weapons and post them on the steam workshop! (valve may add it to the game!). Tons of achievements that you can unlock! Tournaments that you can go in! Create your own server that you and your friend can play in! Create guides for the other new users! Create artwork and post screenshots and post them on steam!"
this is a bad ♥♥♥ game 
"One of the best team based multilplayer games ever.  Astonishing game, lots to collect. I guarente you will like this game, and ay it's F2P give it a try."
I just got a Steam Wallet card pin for free! :D  ﻿http://steamwalletcodes.com 
"If you're poor, love stupid cosmetic items, and love the brazilian gaming community then this is the game for you!"
"Continuing from the classic Half Life mod Team Fortress Classic, this game is constantly being updated and improved. You can trade Items with players across the world, collect and craft your way to the top, play as Red or Blue and comeplete objectives, or pimp your class out with stylish hats and accessories. Team Fortress 2 is always a game that you can turn to in order to waste some time and have fun while in comeplete chaos and silliness.  There are nine personality filled classes to choose from to fit your liking, each one has a different set of skills, and over time you can get enhanced weapons by playing, buying them from the shop, or even trading with a stranger! Definetely a game I'd recommend to players that love free deathmatching games with a ton of things to do on the side."
"In its current state TF2 is a mess.  Its a shame because the core game is still awesome, you get a glimpse of it here and there.  But its a diamond in a turd situation these days.   (Edit: Why comment on this? I was just dissapointed in Valve and what they did to TF2 over the years as I wanted to vent, its one of my most played games, and its sad that it took overwatching being successful for Valve to take an interest in the game again, and continue its tradition of ruining it.  I have 183 hours on it but I have owned it since the Orange Box came out. I havent played much in recent years due to the changes Valve has made.  Depth? Heres some:  Well, first of all all the added stuff that they throw into the game that is the ♥♥♥♥ I was referring to. I was trying to play some game, half the server decided to conga. Not fun when you want to shoot people, and shooting people trying to conga isnt fun. Call me old fashioned.  The 'simplfied' system to get into games is terrible. Trying to find a decent custom server but 95% of them being trade or 'goof' ones. The leveling system.... what? Thats a great addition to the game 24 years after it came out.  The server stacking whereby people just quit games that look like loses that turns into an endless cycle so that you either are on a team that just dominates to the point where its not fun or loses to the point where its not fun. (I play for fun fyi)  All the extra weapon effects and types that took a simple game and made it more complicated than it needed to be. The stupid crafting system..... Most of the additions that they have made to the game have been to its detriment. (And I even supported the f2payification) I could go on but I dont really wanna, Valve has a great game here, covered in ♥♥♥♥, like I said in my original 3 sentence review. (Which wasnt a review it was just me venting abit))  TF2 feels like Valves 'throw it against the wall and see if it sticks'. And the only thing that stuck was Hats, everything else has just fallen flat or just added to the bloaty ♥♥♥♥ festering on top of the game.   Also dont try to turn TF2 into an esport this late. Its not going to happen. Isnt CS and Dota enough?  Also let me just tumbs down or up a game instead of forcing me to post a review and you wont get all these pithy 1 sentence reviews.  Its very reflective of Valves style. They add so much stuff to things, the old sales with their cards and their 'earn points' things. The cards (Who actually cares about those?) the dust thing? The badges?  Less is more. And while you toned back the sales, you havent in your games, and they suffer as a result."
ⓉⒽⒾⓈ ⒾⓈ ⒽⒶⒶⒶⒶⒶⒶⒶⒶⒶⒶⓉⓈ !!!
this game is pure and utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and i hate it anyone who plays this game for more than 5 hours is a huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥ good thing i only played one hour before i decided it was ♥♥♥♥ and uninstalled it if you even consider playing this game you might as well kill yourself becaus this game is so bad no one should play it
"Oh my God. This game. This game. First off, I just want to say how good of a game Call of Duty is. Lastly, this game sucks, no headshots."
"TF2 has been going downhill with every update being more reskins and more bugs. With competitive broken along with every other game mode, valve simply doesn't care about fixing tf2 as long as there's money to be made from the 7th reskin of the rocket launcher."
Has hats and guns. I like both..
"I had an awesome adventure , and i mean it by my heart , thank you team fortress 2. without you i wouldnt had 94 friends to play with , playing lobbies , meeting friends , trolling bronies... but you have to know , oh dear tf2 , that i will never forget what you did for me , the memories are in my heart and will never leave. But its time to say goodbye. What valve did to you is unforgettable. Look what happend to you... what you became. I'm sorry but i need to leave you and stop the madness. You will always be in my heart no matter what happend , and again , thank you for the awesome adventure."
"This game died in 2012 and it's just been on a hospital bed, fed through a drip for the past 4 years and now it's even worse than the console version which has no players and no non-vanilla items.  Just don't bother."

"How to get better at TF2: -Buy Overwatch, download, and install it. -Rename it 'TF2 tutorial' -Git gud -Comeback to TF2 and deal with Pyros and hats. Thank me leitah ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
i hate this ♥♥♥♥ing game. good thing this piece of ♥♥♥♥ is for free now or i'd be ♥♥♥♥♥♥.
"This game WAS good at one point but it turned to complete ♥♥♥♥. Here's how it turned into crap and why it is complete crap. There are two main reasons why this game sucks: -Valve -The community Lets start with Valve. Why Valve has made this a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game -All Valve does is make ♥♥♥♥ updates (Gun Mettle update, EOTL) -Valve made just about every single weapon ♥♥♥♥ -Valve doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ with what happens on their TF2 servers. Which leads to my next point-The community -Just about 95% of people on the trade forums are complete idiots and don't read your posts. -Every MvM server is SWARMING with Elietists, MvM Metas, and REMPs. The community is just pure cancer that will kill you instantly. If you are thinking about getting this game DON'T EVER consider buying it. This game has no hope."
you guys should play this i mean what can go wrong? ITS FREAKING FREE NOW!
"No words. Just bullets, rockets, grenades and fire. And fun."
Three words: Meet Your Match
"Bought Unusual for 50 keys. The next day the price went to 30 keys. 10/10 would ♥♥♥♥ myself over again,"
"Re-Review So, I played this game for about 560 hours, or close to it, and I have to say, I was not entirely enjoyable From the time I began to now there has certainly been a degrading quality in the community,market and game. On the community aspect, it seems that, for the unfortunate turn, many have left and those who remain have no real business in playing anything well (case and point MvM). The market has crashed essentaliy putting my 2 years of trading work going to the dumpster, and of course everyone moved to the CSGO market. The game overall has had little content changes and barely anything new concerning gameplay, of course Valve's hat fetish has gotten the best of them.  I can honestly say that while this game is 'Free to play' I spent quite a bit on it, and I really do regret it. "
"This game is a must have for 12 year olds with low self esteem. Seriously if you have the maturity of a 12 year old child and want the opportunity to make yourself feel better about your crummy life by belittling people on an online multiplayer fps game then download this game right now. I have experienced many times on this game absolutely disgusting behaviour from other players in the “community.” It is sad. It is sad knowing that there are so many children growing up in this world who show complete and utter ignorance, unprovoked to people they do not even know.  For instance:   A kid said this to a friend of mine while in a match. “Hey liked how I wrecked you last round?” (No reply from my friend) “Oh what you got nothing to say? Must be too poor to buy a mic.” (So poor yet he owns a computer right?) (I then attempt to kick this child from the game for his ignorance) Random other guy who must have been this child’s friend starts. “What the f#$% you trying to do?” (My vote to kick the initial child fails) (They try and kick me) Shouts “Kick this f@#$^% out of here he's trying to send me pictures of his d$%^” (I get kicked).  Now I don't care about being kicked out of a game. There are many other lobbies I can join to play and try to have “fun” on. What I care about is how completely toxic the community is on this game. Yeah I get it, it is the internet you have to at some point accept the reality that there are many “trolls” and immature children out there. The problem for me is not ignoring it and moving on. The problem is when I, like many others, sit down to relax in their spare time and try to have fun playing a team based game get put into situations of unpleasant, abusive, conflict constantly it becomes something besides fun and enjoyment but rather stressful and disturbing. Literally every server will have people on that have nothing better to say besides overused insults. There is absolutely no need for it. There is not a single thing that requires someone to be a complete piece of trash in order to have fun or even be good at a video game. It ruins everything video games are meant to be about.  Besides the absolutely toxic community in which you cannot really change in anyway there are other issues. The game is goofy with it's cartoon style which is a hint that you should not take it too seriously. If you find yourself taking tf2 seriously then that is the point in time that you should uninstall it. Trust me once you start taking the game seriously you will degrade yourself by involving yourself with the toxic players, you will lose money, you will lose friends and you will no longer enjoy something you once did. I realized this after seeing how much I spent on the game, the situation I explained above and when I started to become frustrated at people dancing around the spawn wasting time (which should be the fun of it yet it became annoying).  Looking at the lucrative “micro transaction” style system involved, it is at least how I see it addicting. Who wants to use ugly stock weapons when they can open crates to get fancy shiny ones or simply buy them? Constantly buying more keys, to open more crates, in the hopes of getting something valuable to get your money back or make a “profit” (it hardly ever happens). It is exactly like gambling and the risk is greater than the reward. You may get an unusual hat but what does that actually do for you? Can you sell it and make a profit? Yes. Can you withdraw that money and buy yourself a bike, or a baseball bat, or pay the rent and bills? Nope. Every dime you spend on this game is forever invested into Steam. So you don't really make anything off of buying and trading these types of virtual items and they do not improve your skills in the game or increase your enjoyment. It gives you this false sense that you did but in the end it eats your money and that is it's only purpose. Spending money on games like this is okay if you really feel like it will bring you enjoyment but fair warning it can end up costing you a significant amount of money especially if you do not know what you are doing. I let myself became consumed in this system and have spent much more than I should ever have with next to nothing to show for in the end. I regret spending any money on this game on the virtual items especially now that I have lost my enjoyment of the game.  Overall I had fun. 800 hours on a free to play game in my opinion made it worth it. What I realize now though is that games like this are only as fun as the people you play them with. I started seeing a significant amount of toxic players no matter what server I was on and that killed my enjoyment. Listening to people constantly insult each other over nothing gets tiring. I guess maybe I am just at an age where I have to move on to another saga of gaming to find more enjoyment. Will I miss playing tf2? Probably not now that I have expanded my game library. Will I play it again? Likely but only for an hour or two here and there just to have fun. I will never invest my time, like I used to, back into this game because it is really not worth it. I would recommend if you want to have some fun (100-500 hours) try Team Fortress 2 out, BUT my warning and the point of my review, DO NOT invest a significant amount of time and/or money into this game. It is really not worth it once you become tired of the toxic community. Everything you worked on getting will increase your disappointment when you make the decision to stop playing the game."
"it was good but valve turned it into csgo :,)"
"1-10Hrs, This game is pretty awesome! 11-20hrs, Wow, my first hat! 21-1518hrs, please, give me your hats."
First hats now skins.  Farewell TF2.  RIP

Hat Simulator - Every Year
Great Game to Play with friends 10/10
The best free to play first person shooter/trade simulator ever! gice it a go
Amazingly fun FPS!
IS EPIC but i hate medic he freaks me out T.T 
My favourite game on Steam! The gameplay is great and the community is even better! 10/10
Super Great
This game is a EXTREMELY addictive team based shooter where having everyone working togetheir is essential.  Even if you don't like the base game VALVe (Volvo Pls) has had good support for custom game modes like Jailbreak PropHunt VS Saxton Hale.  The game has a very deep trading system basically created by the community.  If you have the space and and bandwith this game is a must get.  Atleast try it
Im Loving This Game So Far ! ( as you can see by my hours spent on here.) Ive Played this game a few years ago but never was able to trade and I was missing out on the best part Now that I Am able to trade im experiencing the Full Game !
Amazingly addictive game. For a free game its amazing and is one of the best free steam games out there.
A game about collecting hats and showing off? I thought this was a class based game with several game modes and weapons
Words don't even begin to describe how incredible this game is! I have more hours on my main account ;D   But! It's alot of fun :)   &lt;3
"Basic free to play game, will keep you entertained for many days and years to come. Great game to play with friends or to make new friends. Also if you don't play this you won't get any of the inside jokes society makes. So start playing to catch up with those people who have 10,000 Plus hours."
Great F2P game
best game 1000000009/5 taught me how to be an owl HOOOOOOOOOOT
This is such an awesome game! I recomend it too all!
Great game not pay to win at all i have put too many hours into it and do not regret a moment
"Very fun. All I want is weapons and I've been playing a lot for weapons since that's the only way to get weapons. Weapons are want I want and need. Flamethrowers, snipers, I don't care. As long a I can kill people with it.  Also I like the food. This game provides food you can use as combat weapons. Example: The Holy Mackerel (a fish). Again you can kill people with it.  One thing I get mixed up with in the game is that if you kill someone along the rails or a fence, it looks like they are standing up, so I waste my ammo trying to kill a dead guy.  That's it and remember to get weapons. I recommend this game for people who likes weapons. How many times did I say weapons (not including the time I say weapon in this sentence)?"
400 hour free two play game!
Great Game.... Better then COD
"+The game is a fun FPS with multiple classes to vary up your play style and changes the way it is from other FPS's, then it just being a point and shoot with the regular FPS guns: smg, sniper, assualt rifle, etc. But TF2 adds a more expansive take with weapons: flamethrower, minigun, sentries, etc. I'd say this game is worth it since it's been pretty active for 8 years. (to this date)   -Although the game has multiple hats, misc. etc. for you to wear on your characters, and different types of weapons (genuine, vintage, strange, etc.) with along the trading the comes along with this game and can get you into a fuss over wanting an item for a long time and then going into the habbit of buying everything from either the Mann Co. Store or the Steam Market. This game will consume your money more then 'pickpocketers' in Europe.   Although the game is a new a fun FPS with still 8 years of active people and with the downfall of trading I still give this game a..  9/10"
"A very great first-person shooter. The gameplay is brilliantly balanced and addicting. I would give it 10 out of 10. Thank you Valve for this amazing game.     Oh, and the hats; you can't forget the hats."
it´s a awesome game with many great weponds and maps.
Best online multiplayer game ever is the best online multiplayer game ever.
this game is fun all of the time and really has a lot of houmer in it.
Whether its shooting the !@#% out of a brain dead potato while singing the national anthem in unison with your favourate chew toy. All I have to say is porridge. 8/10
"Best game ever! Gameplay is great, graphics are great, and trading is the bomb! Definetly recommend. "
Utterly amazing game!
"This game, unlike most other FPS games, is't designed to be ultra-realistic. It's characters are unique, fresh, clean (or at least some of them) and are a world of laughs. With mildly cartoony physics and comic book-style graphics, Team Fortress is wonderfull to play or even look at."
So this is a review about Team Fortress 2.
Best Game Ever.Not only i loved the game because of killing but because of its economy too.I definately recommend it
"Perhaps the first FPS game I've felt comfy playing in a really long time. Goofy, and nonsensical is probably what sells this game the best.      and hats and taunts"
Thank you Team Fortress 2 for hundreds of hours of awesome. Thank you for the free random item drops. Thank you for the holiday events. Thank you for being free. God bless
"I've wasted many glorious hours playing this, and I can say I've had one heck of a time. In Team Fortress 2, you're essentially playing 9 different games at once with the radical gameplay differences each class has, and on top of that the many gamemodes provides even more diverseity to how you play each class, since their role changes depending on the gamemode. It is an unorthodox and first person shooter that continues to break the mold of what a game in the genre can be, and I would recommend it to anyone that, essentially, wants something that is completely different, while still maintaining enough familiarity for those accustomed to the fps genre. Effective teamwork, diversity, balanced and fast-paced gameplay; what more could you ask for in a fun-to-play and free-to-play first person shooter like TF2. Oh yeah...hats...don't forget about hats..."
"I got this because of wint3r... I HATE WINT3R... The game isn't exactly addictive. With the knowledge anyone can join tournements after 50 hours it motivates you to keep playing. another thing is the items, you want the best of the best and again more motivation to play... finally I got scammed and the dropped my morale so low i haven't played this in 3 months.  And yet I still recomend this, I wonder what is the motivation is this time."
If you are okay with spending your life savings and the rest of the time you have on Earth trying to get decent hats.   Buy TF2.  11/10 would do again.
Best F2P Game so far on Steam! :D
ITS FUN AND LIKE YEA AND U PAY MONEY AND U LIKE ITS GOOD CUZ U WIN.  
"Fun, awesome, and completely multiplayer dependent. This game is FREAKIN AMAZIN"
"why not, its tf2! :D"
Fun and discorver new things
Because it makes you a hardcore gamer and not ruins your life and its free.
All I can say about is game is that it is pure and utter brillance about from the fact you are considertered awful unless you have single hat you called terrible and i find that annoying but i love the different weapons rangeing from a sapper that talks when you dont want it to to a flame thrower that shoots rainbows.
It was the reason I got steam
THIS IS MY FAVORITE GAME!! What more to say?? THE BEST GAME EVER! EEEEEEEEVVVVVVVAAAAARRRRRR!!!!!!

"Hard to describe this Game sincerely, everytime you go back playing this. It just brings back the thrilling and exciting moments! Especially the Item Drop System waiting for a lucky opportunity of Hats! :3  Rated: 10/10"
"Team Fortress 2 is a free to play first person shooter game. If you are not familiar with first person shooters i highly recommend you give this one a shot. Before playing this game, i mainly played mmorpgs and wasnt interested in the fps genre. This game is great for people new to fps games because many mechanics are different from other fps games, (ex. Call Of Duty, Battlefield, Counter Strike, Blacklight Retribution, etc.). First, you do not have to buy weapons with in game currency. Most fps games have you gain alot of in game currency so you can afford guns, however, tf2 has an item drop system where you will randomly find weapons during respawns. This makes the game much more fun because you can get better weapons early on and not have to spend hours in front of your computer grinding in matches. Next, there is the comedy factor. Team Fortress actually doesnt have a war based campaign, but instead has a comedic violence factor that will ease you into playing and enjoying the game. In conclusion, Team Fortress 2 is a free to play fps game and i would highly recommend it to people new to the fps genre. (i apologize for any typos in this review, i kinda typed it really fast :3)"
"Team Fortress 2 is very awesome! Good graphics, very enjoyably and addictive! Hope that the game will go well in the future but, there are some things that's kinda out of hand. First is the community pricing about items, damn the price just keeps higher and higher! It's getting out of control. Besides that, everythings is all good! Get this game! #RatedM"
Love the game my self :3 i hope you do to
"Very good, fun, and addictive game, though it's hard to start off you eventually get used to it and soon you will be knifing heavies by the lot. Take some time to get used to the classes, experiment with gear and practise. Sometimes the community is harsh but that is to be expected. 9/10"
I really enjoy this game! It has a unique play style and the graphic design is a never aging beaut.
"Wow, I've played this game for over 700 hours, I have no life.  Okay, to sum this game up; Hats And It's infested with n00bs wearing the f#@king gibus, a kitten dies everytime someone equips the gibus.  I myself is an 1337 pro with hats 4 dayz.   and it's free to play, seriously get it   1337/10 would hat again.    "
If you haven't played TF2 then I don't know why you have a Steam account
Best hat economy game ever. 420/360
it's ok
You can explode people pretty good.
I recommend this game.
Fantastic game with focus on gameplay over cosmetics
great game any body would like
"I love this game . It's like having a baby , you really love it at first , like a lot , then you forgot it for about 1 year and after that you still find it and you love him again . ;)"
Awesome game !!! Lots of fun ...(trade me)...
tf2 sucks
"Well, probably the best game i have ever played. Thanks valve!"
this game is one of the best games of all times edit:the economy is ♥♥♥♥ed thanks a lot back pack.tf dont ruin cs go u ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥
"Too many hats, please nerf."
I have wasted to much of my life on this game
"Love the game, had over 700 hours on it but it kinda kills your wallet sometimes still, 11/10"
Best Damn Game i've played online!
Played a bit... I liked it
"'This game made me feel like a part of me died, but then another part had just been born...'"
"In my opinion this is the best game i ever played so far. Many different and fun to play gamemodes. Great class custumization with dozens and dozens of weapons and cosmetics. New updates, maps, weapons, cosmetics is appearing fast. I highly recomend this DEFINENTLY. hope it helps :)"
Welcome to Team HATress 2! This is the best shopping game EVAR. Sometimes you have to shoot people with guns and stuff but the REAL point of this game is to give 9 different people the most life-changing makeovers of their minute-long lives! Shame you can only choose two colors though.
Having Fun with this
This is a game.
The Best Free to Play game ever! :D
Nice game
I bought this back when it was $20. Now it's free. I am OK with this because hats.  10/10 Would play even if Valve could count to 3.
this game is so much fun 
Best Game i´ve ever Played :)
"I wanted to wear hats, earn hats, collect hats, probably do something else to the hats.. 600 hours in I regret wasting this much time in my life to play some bullet shooting hat wearing gibus giving game  I went in too deep. Please help me out."
this game is SHAMWOW
Tf2 is a great game with taunts and weps and much more....AND HATS U CANT FORGET THE HATS!this game isnt too over the top and isnt too bad.Personaly i love it i play it alot and i got from 3 weps too a few taunts and hats that shows the community is nice and isnt bad either so yes i recommend this game.it has its rages and some laughs!!
Hats and Swag
The most fun you can have online? I agree.
"TF2 is by far the best free game on the steam market. It has a variety of game modes (plus it's free! (can't go wrong with free games)). With some free games, you find to actually do something, you have to pay, but you can rock on tf2 without having to pay a single penny! Spy and soldier are my favourite classes and my soldier is pimped with awesome gear that i traded for on trade servers. I would reccomend this to anyone who likes action packed first person shooters!!"
"This game is extremely fun. Many different game modes (including custom game modes by the TF2 community) and maps (tons of community made maps). Nine fun unique classes to chose from which all take an important role in the battle. You may find some classes or aspects of classes hard to grasp but with practise you will be successful. There tons of unique weapons to get but many of them are useless and pointless (some of these bad weapons have been changed for the better but bad weapons are still present). There are hundreds of cosmetic items in this game but you don't need to appreciate them to enjoy this game. This game is free so try it out, you won't waste any money if you don't enjoy it. Also, random crits suck."
Very nice game.
"Hats, Bread, conga, and a sandvich"
"This FPS is not like others FPS : no SMG, no assault rifle... With 9 differents classes, Team Forteress 2 has a very various gameplay, if you do not want to play as one class, you can choose one of the 8 others classes of the game! Each class has his speciality and they are all balanced. And, to finish, this game is FREE and you can get all weapons randomly when you are playing ; so this game is not a 'pay to win'. That is why I recommend this game, also because i have more than 1000 hours of gaming and i still love this game :)"
Really love this game !!!
i highly recomed this gam its so fun
This game is a classic. A MUST PLAY :D It's so simple and free :D HOURS OF FUN :)
"Good friends, nubs for easy kills, hats hats hats hats and more hats"
Absolutely brilliant game. It's a must!
"I've played this game for so many hours, but I'm still not even that great at the game. I can't rocket jump for anything, I still can't properly time airblasts, I'm pretty bad with the Scout, I've barely played Sniper at all. But you know what? There are a few things I can do: I can pop a perfectly timed Uber, I can be useful as a Heavy and heal my teammates with my sanvich, I can stickyjump and aim the Loch'n'Load pretty well, I can setup buldings in strategic spots to be as useful to my team as possible, I can get backstabs half the time I try, and I'm pretty damn good at prop hunt. You see, tf2 is a game you can play for the rest of your life if you find some servers with a good crowd of regulars that use their mics. I've had so many fun times just effing around on some servers, that alone makes the game worth trying. Unfortunately, the tf2 community is extremely divided nowadays. This community used to be one of the best around, a part of it still is, but the more updates there are the more the community splits apart. If you plan on playing this game, it being free there's no reason not to, PLEASE use your mic. Another unfortunate thing about today's tf2, there's less people using their mics than ever and that's how you really work as a team and have fun with one another. Don't be afraid about being new to the game, a lot of people in the community may look down on you, but myself and plenty of others won't. Feel free to ask for help, start with Heavy as your first class and work from there. The shenanigans that occur in this game are limitless, I feel Valve has strayed quite a bit from the game's artstyle with all the cosmetics they've added (originally a pair of windowed shades were how far they'd stretch tf2's artstyle and now that restraint is non-existant) but the game's core mechanics are still great. This game has an incredibly high skill ceiling, it's near impossible for someone to master ALL the classes in the game, so just find 2 or 3 that you like and play them to your heart's content. I maybe only have 1 hour logged with Sniper because I'm terrible at sniping in video games and don't like being a sniper in general, but I'm sure if I practiced with him as much as a played as Demoman or Heavy or Engineer or Soldier or Medic, then I'd actually be decent at sniping. In this game, like most games, practice makes perfect, well not really perfect, more like practice makes you credit to team. Initally, no you won't be credit to team, but the more you play the more useful you will become so keep at it and find a few classes who's playstyle suits YOU! tl;dr I've played this game for a while and I still suck as Sniper, Scout, and Pyro, but I do make a pretty great Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, and Medic and an average Soldier and Spy. The classes I'm good at I'm good at because I played with them a lot and I liked their playstyle. If you play this game you're almost guaranteed to find one class who's playstyle you enjoy so I encourage you to delve into tf2 and find YOUR class. After 9 years in development this game was worth the weight, thanks for reading this review and have fun!"
I can now push a bomb while doing the conga. Best game ever.
This is a MUST have game!
"No game has sucked more time out of my life than Team Fortress 2. This is one of the few FPSs where you actually have to think, and the only one where having a hat that's on fire makes you pro. Try this motha♥♥♥♥a out if you haven't already, BROTHER."
Pretty mean game ayyy
Best game ive ever played
"I think so far about this game, I love it! I love the different classes, Hats, Taunts, Weapons, all of it! Except, the fact of the TF2 Economy going crazy! I mean, the price of buds are going down and keys are going up in the community. That's nuts! But over all, it's pretty good."
Team Fortress 2 is an awesome action-packed game that will make you want to play all night. I would totally recommend this game to my friends and to people that enjoy first person shooters and people that enjoy playing with many.
Destroyed my social life. 10/10 GALLON HAT
"Good game, only writing this for badge"
"As a fan of Team Fortress, my opinion is very much in this games favour. Its free-to-play ideology proves to display little amounts of bugs, which do tend to annoy the player when they occur. Otherwise, the game is superb; with great class options, witty voice-acting, huge fanbase and a variety of fun gamemodes, weapons and costumes.   This game is truly one of the most enjoyable FPS's of all time, must get!    Pros: One of the best free to play games out there! Cons: Large amount of bugs. Have to pay money to look amazing-market is cheaper.  ~8/10~"
"If you don't play this game, there's something wrong with you. This game is one of the BEST games I have ever played, and everyone else should play it too."
"You can wear hats, that's ok I guess."
420/10 would buy hats
"This is a great free to play game which is not a pay to win game, the gameplay is fun and the community is awesome  10/10"
great game with lots of modes to keep you entertained for days. The real fun is with trading and building value in you backpack.
I LOVE YOU BABY
You have to play this game. YOU will be amazed on how this game is and you may end up playing this game. You have 9 classes to choose from and each with their strengths and weaknesses. See you on the battlefield
"As far as I know, it's the only class-based multiplayer shooter where a crazed rogue soldier can detonate a fast talking kid from Boston using only a futuristic rocket launcher meant for mangling cows. Oh, and did I mention he was flying through the air at Mach speeds, while sporting a bright lime green Santa beard, a Dr. Seuss hat with money forever falling from the brim, and an eagle taped to his shoulder? Not to mention the Scout was doing the conga with a massive man from Russia, who was obsessed with sandwiches. Yeah. The Soldier's probably screaming something along the lines of 'MAGGOTS!' too. Gabe, we waited nine years. We got update after update, waiting for the incredible potential of this masterpiece to be unleashed upon the PC gaming community. Now, because the situation mentioned above is entirely possible within ANY game I have ever played (and enjoyed, for that matter,) I can die a happy person. My soul will be rested with nothing left desired from this world. I can indeed say, this game was, without a doubt, worth the weight.   PLAY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW, OR GABE'S WRATH WILL FOREVER BE INFLICTED UPON YOU AND ALL OF YOUR FAMILY TREE. *not really. But, seriousally, play the game. It is extremely good, the best in the FPS genere, in my opinion. Give it a whirl. IT'S FREE. 10/10 Best Gabe Ever"
"Excellent game, good to have fun with your friends or just random people. AND ITS FREE! So why not just give it a try, 100% sure you'll enjoy it!"
It sucks because I always die
"Team Fortress 2 is a game about the most cut throat thing in human history, fashion. Every aspect of this award winning game is made as an allegory to the ever changing world of fashion and the pitfalls that can befall any who wish to partake of this amazing experience. You must find hats and accessories through a random drop system that represents the elusive mistress of, 'inspiration.' Then you must find the perfect colors, names, and descriptions for your hats and accesories to set yourself apart from the other less fortunate players of the game. This would be a boring system much like the many you can find in the bland JRPGs that litter the market. What sets TF2 apart is their inclusion of a fantastic and complicated mini-game about shooting each other that blends wonderfully into the allegorical narrarative of cut throat, fast paced, deadly fashion."
The spy is the spy is the spy is the spy is the spy is the spy is the spy is the spy is the spy is the spy is the spy
"I cant figure out how to get the latest update, but other then that I think the game is amazing."
"One of the best games ever, due to customization, gameplay and the ECONOMY!"
great game 
I love this game so much.
Fun game. Must play
Creative Addicting Fun. 3 words to describe Team Fortress 2
"Great FPS, up there with CounterStrike and the older CoDs. It's free too, so there's no need not to try it!"
great game :)
i think tf2 is cool
"Fantastic game with a great competitive scene, entertainment for hours, and never gets old. Played since 2007 and still going strong, thanks, Valve!"
"Warning this game may be addictive and may blur your eyes (YOLO) hate that word but why did I use it anyway? Because I don't know and so do you. Its a fun game, but other people mainly trade instead of playing the game which makes the game uhh... yeah. If you never even played it or worse if you never heard of this game I don't think you're human. So sitback relax and wait for the very long download of this game If you are planning to play, which you will........."
I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game.
The best free to play game ever
Well we all see free to play games that have a very littl
It's free...... but you will spend every dime you have.
Pretty much the best Hat Simulator you can find.  10/10 Would pay again
Cool first person shooter game 
"Lots of fun, tons of items to collect and plenty of enemies to gib."
team fortress 2 did you mean my life
Hat Simulator 2014. Best game ever.
"Guys, take a break away from CoD and those campers. Play TF2 and relax. And to all you CoD Fanboys, STOP YO WHINING JAYSUS PLAS STOP MAN!"
Free to play and really fun too!
"I recommend team fortress 2 becasue it is a good game to play, You don't have to be good, there are new thing every time they update it do you won't get borad, there are lots of severs to play on so you don't have to stay on one sever, you get to play with lots of people, this game makes my controls better casue you got to jump, run fast, shoot, and kill alot of times. This game helps me on typeing, the W,A,S,D controls and my mouse/aiming/moving/looking too. Try it you will maybe like it as well as i do."
"I love this game so much! I give it 100,000,000,000 stars! I so recommend this game."
What is this game....?  Maybe the best team based game in the hole world.Dont Miss this opportunity and download it now.!
This game is pretty fun and its also free.
it's ok i guess.
this game has miniguns and a flamethrower and more
This ame is cool with a nice trading feature and graphics which fit
"Really nice game to just pick up, join, play.  Yes, yes there are a lot of people going on: WOW i got 18 spys on my team; Only M1+W Pyro's; I got this medick with nothning buth shooting syringes... And so on. Also there is a lot of hype about the hats... BUTH THAT DOSENT MATTER!!! Free to play or Pay to play its all the same... You get the best weapons (well almost all) at the beggining as stock weapons! Yes you can upgrade to strange, vintage, unusual, genuine and so on buth it dosent matter if you do or not... Also the hats are just something you have to look like something... They are not really a big deal. And if dont wanna spend any money on this game buth on another steam game you get to 'half premuim'-That means you get 100 slots (maybe more), you can craft metal into hats (really spend your usefull weapons for metal and spend 3 refinds to get a hat... Any then you just do that and you can get up to stuff fast and quick and with almost no 'no-fun-time' couse even knowing that tradeing is kinda ruining this game you can still have some fun douing it if you got a reason to.  Owerall: greate game, fast and slow paced, difrent stuff to do (my favorite: Rocket/Sticky jumping, difrent game mods as you get in GMod)... Has greate 'get a competitative game fast' option if you just go to: TF2 Center and click the first link log in and play (you wanna have about 1000 hours so people wont go on and on about how bad you are. Also dont play the medick, pocket for the first time! Accept if you really got lots of hours like about 3000-4000.  So just get in dont worry and have fun.  10/10 Steams. 11/10 Hats. 1/10 Gabe's. 10/10 Nice game!"
Fun and very easy to get the hang of. One of valve's best. 11/10
"this gam,e is life, i like sildierman is better, fire is badd. kill me much Soldire is fun, shoot bang USA, wood sex much soldier my love for u is like honey pls come to me  10/10  stalin&gt;back burn fiereman i find game from stre_  he funn yman  jerma good to, bakestab"
"This is an amazing game that plays on the individual humor of every single individual who plays this. This game requires practice to improve and often tests your timing, thinking, and strategic abilities. Overall, it is a game that you can never (hopefully) get bored at."
This is really great game i like it :)
Best game on steam by a long run!
"To be honest, I actually hated this game 2 months ago and I do not know what happened but it really grew on me, probably something to do with hats but I don't know. I recommend this game to anyone looking for good free fun and free items."
"Best game I've ever played, insane amounts of fun, and all for free! You might however find your experience being limited based on how many uniqe in-game items you have. Nevertheless, it is a game I will definetly reccomend to anyone!  9/10"
Team Fortress 2 is an amazing game its good for when you have alot of friends with you but some classes are indeed overpowered and need to be downgraded
This game is fun and exciting to play!
"My very first steam game, this game holds a special place in my heart, but after buying other games I cant get myself back into this game."
"I love this game...most definitely worth intsalling if your looking for fun, comedy, guns and hats &lt;3"
One of the best games of all time. Even when I buy new games I always come back to this game and play. Buy it if you can worth it!
 ***1/2 3.5 out of 4
This game is good because it stops the bleeding in my ♥♥♥♥.
YES I DO RECOMMEND IT.. I JUST DO!
tf2 is the best
Its a great game to play with friends!
It's good.
It needs pugs  
"I played this game a lot, it's fun. The only issue with it is that (since I main spy) when I try to go for a backstab, I hear a critical hit soun indicator and either the damage doesn register or the backstab doesnt register. It get's really annoying. Overall great game though"
It has hats.
"This game... THIS GAME... Has done me lots of favors. I don't go outside, I'm not in honor's classess anymore, and I have no life... And got some hats out of this."
its one nice game ^_^
Gabe Newell is a fascist pig
"It is a very good game with lots of good things that are good, but the servers are not good why are they not good, i'll tell you why. They are not good because the people are mean to me so that is not good but what is good is the random drops that is good i got a gun which is very good because it is one shot kill that is good. what is bad the op weapons that people use it isnt very good, but what is good is that the characters are funny so that is good becuase it makes me laugh with kek    thanks for reading my good review tell me how good it is by messaging on my good steam page   bye - Good Gamer1"
"I really don't know why i am doing this, but i guess you could play it.... "
"Still pouring hours of play into this game. Whether it's the communities you're involved in, friends you've made, or pride amounnted on personal achivement, this game tops all in the Multiplayer FPS genre."
"I have been playing Team Fortress 2 for a year now, and all I can say is it's an amazingly unique FPS game. It can go from serious to silly in a matter of seconds, and the playstyle of the 9 classes is special in every way. The community is extremely friendly and sometimes even helpful. And not only that, the personalities of the nine mercenaries are just downright hilarious! So if you are looking to have some silly fun times while blowing people and stuff up to pieces, then Team Fortress 2 is the game for you!"
"One of the best games ive played in a long time  Team Fortress 2 is a fun, entertaining FPS that everyone can enjoy. From the Gameplay to the Weapons to the Gore to the Hats... THE HATS!!  I love playing this game with lots of friends and we just have a ball!  9..5/10 Keep up the good work!  (Soo are Valve gonna make TF3? or Portal 3? PLS just make it!!!)"
Got me hyped for bread...  10/10
Has hats 10/10
10/10 would HAT again
This is awesome
"This game has inspired me to play more and my freinds enjoy this game because of the classes and their special abilitys. eg. engineer has the sentry and the demoman has the chagin, charge and the medic with his ubercharge. If you are reding this thank you and please enjoy the game!!! Bye!!!!   P.S my friend and cousin said that you guys should add DLC`s if thats okay thanks!!!   BIUNE,sonxXx  "
"Ruined my life, can only think about hats. 10/10 would play again."
Great strategic-based game to play with friends or just going solo.
"I don't know why i never wrote a recommendation for TF2 before, but better late than never, right?  Anyhow, long story short, play this. Simple as that. I mean, first off, it's F2P. And paying players don't get an advantage on free players either! Plus, it's ridiculously fun! To hell with 'pretend-to-be-realistic' modern shooters. TF2 is probably the most fun you can have online when it comes to gaming.  A easy to pick-up-and-play, very hard to master, free game. What else could you wish for? MORE hats?"
I never going to stop playing team fortress 2
The best Hat Simulator around.
Tf2 is a very fun Game :D
Truly the best fun you can have online and it's FREE-TO-PLAY go for it :)
Best game Ever Pro's Only Play This game No 1 alse would fight for weapons they will fight for thier life! 
This game is awesome!
Before I started playing Team Fortress 2 I thought spending more than 100 hours on a game was ridiculous. Look at me now.  
Its really fun.
"Great game, crazy addicting"
"This Free Shooter is just great,Starting with crappy weapons First,If you play the game for way f*cking long it will give you tons of weapons.I love this game!"
Great game. Just try it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Team Fortress 2 is good. I have lots of fun with this game. The items are cool. Trading items with the TF2 community is awesome! I will keep playing until I grow up (probably never).
team fortress 2 is one of the best free to play steam game. with its comedy timing it is one big circus
This is probably the greatest free roam fps game other than battlefield f2play...
Silly and Fun Face me? Pfftt GG Loser
Faboulas
nice game never get boringof it 
"This game is entertaining, you will always find new things to do in this game. For every map there are different game modes, for the different game modes there are different ways to play. for all the different ways to play there are different classes. with all the different classes there are tons of weapon combonations and there is always one loadout you didnt use yet :D"
All hail to the holy Gaben and his mighty work. We have to be thankful for his small mercies!
this game is awsome I have literly played this game for more then 1000 hours and I am still not board of it I fell like I could pla this for 9000 hours and wodent be bord of it :-) XD (-: its awsome get it
Spent nearly all my time trading virtual items for other virtual items to get the best virtual hat so I can show off and brag about howq much time I wasted getting it. Gaben did well 10/10
Fashion Fortress 2 is one of the best game for anyone who loves barbies and killing people!
Just...Awesome...
awsome game 100/100
"Team Fortress 2 is multiplayer game where u can play with ur friends and fun with them in multiple modes of this game.But sadly hackers come here with diffirent hacks (Aimbot, Wallhack...) and spammers making u think u can get something by giving them ur items(example: get a golden pan for ur hole items). I dont recomande this game for people under 14 years old, and hopefully Steam will find a way to stop hackers from making this game ur wors nightmare."
This Games FREAKING AWESOME I LOVE IT SOOO MUCH
"It's time to trade hats, and trade hats, and i'm all outta to trade hats."
One of the best games ever made !!!
I very much enjoy this game. Lots of ways to play.
It's a fun game to play every now and then if you've got nothing else to do. Personally I couldn't play this all day everyday.
"this game is a FPS (first person shooter) game which is played by gamers worls wide. i really love this game by its graphic design, trading in-game."
"This is an amazing game, I hope they make new game modes such as team deathmatch's and stuff."
"Team Fortress 2 has changed a lot recently, and you know what? In my opinion, it's not getting better. Not any more. Unless Gaben or the community does something about this Free-to-play game, it might just die one day. The servers will be empty, the only ones that will be filled is trading servers and 'competitive' servers, which is kind of bulshit in itself. 'TF2 was not meant to be a competitive game.'  Anyway, TF2 has still changed me, sorta. Or should I say, the people I've met has changed me and how I look at the game today. As an autistic little f*ck I am, I loved the competitive community, until a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t happened in the UGC leauge, around the seasons 12 and 13. Maybe there's still some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t left, who knows.  But for a F2P, this game is a great experience, if you want to find out what unbalanced teams and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t weapons are, you're more than welcome to join TF2!  6/10, I'm still playing it.  Yeah, I swear a lot. So?~ &lt;3 "
A really good game. My favourite game
:)
"This game is an awesome FPS game, one of my favourites. It is probably the best free-to-play multiplayer game, and I really like it because there is a lot of skill involved, so there's always something new to learn or get better at."
"My oppinion of a first person shooter done right. This game has so much going for it. The levels are well designed, and fun to play on. All 9 of the classes are unique and balance well (each class has it's own niche and weakness). Controls are smooth and easy to pick up, even for a person new to the FPS genre. The comunity has an empesis on creativity with a workshop, mod maps, character custimization (both cosmetics and weapon loadouts), trading, and much more. Finaly, this game has something that no FPS has had in a long time, as sense of humor and presonality mostly stemming from the characters unique personas and how they interact with eachother."
You need to play it belive it
"This is really fun and unique, so much options and hats. This game is like why steam is still up!"
team fortress2 is my favourite game the most but it is not just one we do like there are thousand games to try and maybe one of them is really your favourite i just choose this game beacuse most of my friends play this and sometimes this game is fun and funny
"The Perfect game 10/10, would ruin my life again."
"I love it it goes out of it's way To add hilarity each major update, and Adds varity to each wep giving player more exitement with every drop. "
"A really fun FPS game that kills time! It is a free to play game but you can also buy items in game, which will make you a premium player. Premium players get access to trading and a larger backpack that can hold more items. I really recommend checking it out, it is free :) !"
"this game is a lot of fun, it may be hard at first but once you get the hang of it you'll have the time of your life"
This game is really fun &amp; addicting
"What is this game called Tf2 u say? This game is great. If you like first person shooter and funny stuff, join TF2! Where Valve always cares about us!"
"I'm beginning to start to unbox (unbox) I keep unboxing, don't know what I want (I want) I don't care this or that what I got (I got) They say I keep unlocking all locks so call me lock god. But for me to unlock locks by all means. I need money in my steam wallet. Add funds, sell stuff and gain profit. Got a fat knot from the steam market. Keep buyin and sellin off of it. Ever since Gabe Newell was still in office. With updates being added (daily) I'm an gamer still as honest. But keep spending and burning money like all hell. Team Fortress, Key fortress (Unlock them) This Crickety crackety rackety crick crack I have so much p*ss glass in my backpack. Packin a bat in the back of the sac. Backpack rack crap sac sac nap-sac And at the exact time time I attempt to unbox these boxes while I buy that. I'll still be able to unbox a mother f*ckin crate Over the back of a couple of f2ps and also buy a new hat. Only realized the duplicates. I had so much items I could craft How could I not craft? I had so much s-bombs. Feel my wrath of attack People want a trading period. Decline, they're all sad. My rep is going to be really bad While I keep unboxing all these boxes in front of them (yeah)"
Why I joined Steam...
"Having played this game for a while now, I felt that I should reveiw it. now this game I loved when I started playing and still play it more. Not only just killing each other in an animated world of comedy and mindless killing, You can find hats and paints to somewhat change your apperance in game and craft other things that can be 'rare' or just have fun in a conga line. This game almost always has surprised me, the only problem I have seen are the 'tryhards' who just want to ruin your fun and enjoyment."
"Tf2 is awesome, just download it and play :D"
"Terrible game. I wish I would stop seeing it on my Library, even though I uninstalled it. "
"no its not worth   you pay for it later  like, REALLY pay for it later  save your money"
"The first time i placed my grubby little hands on a tide turner, i swerved through the hoards of red, not too long after that a quick and fammiliar ding rewarded me with the loch and load. I will never forget the time i jumped,crouched shot my loch into the face of a cloaked spy to then surf the exsplosin into a sniper with a crit charge. 2fort since i was little , ctf holds way too much memorys"
"One of the best free to play game, with good graphics and... All in it is fantastic."
Piro: mmph? Shpee: Ah shet
"TF2's ideal for quick, intense matches or fun rolling battles; being free to play means that there's barely any barrier to play, and the game allows you to play to your style. Now, find yourself a strong, friendly, accepting community of fun people to play with, and you don't need any other games."
"I highly recommend getting Team Fortress 2, wheter you are getting because it's free and looking for something new or plan on being a dedicated fan. This is a fast paced action shooter with 9 unique classes to choose from each supporting thier team in diffirent ways.One of the besy shooters out there. And hey, it's free!(Unless you become dedicated and decide to spend your hard-earned cash on items, but the base price is nothing."
5/5 - Would play again
i recommed tf2 because its the best and most awesome game ever try it and you wont regret it
!!!!
There is nothing boring about this game. It's awesome. It gets fun after you get the hang of it. You may have to play a week or so until you start to get the hang of it. GET IT! NOTHING BEATS FREE!
Just hats. Magnicent hats.
"Fun at times, but the learning curve is quite sizable; new players will be less likely to enjoy. Once some more experience is gaained however, it provides the player with hours upon hours of entertainment. Definately one of the best free to play games out there."
the best of the game in the world!!
"Very amuzing game, not a 'jump-in-and-play' game though, will take time to learn, esspecially if from CoD"
TF2 (Hat-Sim) is a good game.
♥♥♥♥ this game is good
This game is a sham.
"I only just got this game and I really like it. Super enjoyable and always fun, even if you get killed over and over. It's not a game that makes me rage when I die, because it's just fun no matter what. Team Fortress 2 is definitely one of my favorite games on Steam.  Update after several months playing: I still really love this game! I'm not good at it, not in the slightest, but I love the game. I only wish there were things you could get from the store without actual money, because I want to put different things on my characters and use keys but I can't unless I spend real money, which is a downer."
Great game! Recommended to all players out there!
"Likely the best game of the century. Albeit too many newbies.  But well, hats.  'Nuff said."
TF2 In a nutshell Started playing No weapon Found a weapon Killed somone Got a new weapon Started Idling for new weapons Stopped Idling Found a market Bought a lot of keys Opened crates Got sh*t out of it Quit tf2 Come back  Trade up from 1$ to over 150 in 1 day Trade up from 10$ to over 100 in 2 days Bought Items People respect me and call me a hacker Mission accomplished
"After playing over 200+ hours of Team Fortress 2 i'd thought i'd give my review of the game. Let's start off with the gameplay. Basically you get to play 9 unique classes Scout,Soldier,Pyro,Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy. Every class i've played with seems to have a weakness but i guess that's what makes them unique for example, the scout runs really fast with 125 hp but they seem to get killed easily if you're not dodging every bullet your enemy shoots at you. The spy has 125 hp same as the scout but it relies on disguises to keep themselves well hidden but it doesn't last very long till someone discovers who you really are.  While i was playing the game i also notice that they have a shop, so i checked it out and they had all kinds of stuff, they had outfits,weapons, and even taunts for every class now for me i really don't buy things in the game with REAL MONEY but i did buy a couple of things that looked pretty cool to me.  Another thing i did like but really didn't dove into is the trading. Everyone in the TF2 community loves to trade things such as hats,weapons,taunts,keys,trading cards etc you name it they'll trade it. Unfortunately you can't really trade anything till you buy something from the store.  Now for the community, most of the people in the community consist of little kids, people who like MLP, and obnoxious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s but i don't let that bother me since i have the option to mute or block them. People in this community don't really like F2P players cause according to them they are considered noobs and in order to not be a F2P player you can buy something from the store and you won't be considered one.  Anyways that is my review of Team Fortress 2 if you're into fps games then this is for you hope you all have a wonder day/night."
Tf2 Is an F2P Game that puts you in the role of the RED team or the BLU team and 1 of 9 classes fighting over land. You can pay money in the store to be a premium member and access all of the game If You are new expect to be clled a F2P Noob but don't let that get you down just play and enjoy your self. I Give this game a 10/10.
TF2 (Team Fortress 2) is very fun because it is fast paced you can collect items buy items trade and its just all around excitement! I am glad to see so many people love this game!
Nice game for 'F2P' I played this game like 4-5 Year and I still love him ! My friends tell me to not spend my money on this '♥♥♥♥' game but I say:'I never going to stop love this game. I still some times play this game but now I got another games :P  Thx for reading :D
"STOLE ALL OF MY MONEY... Worth it, dough"
great fps with many diferent weapons and hats.I recomend you get it if you don't have it
Do I even have to ask how awesome this game is?
"Good, It's The Hat Game."
"I've started playing this only recently, but I've known of it for a long time. I heard about it through G-Mod videos, but I didn't exactly know it was a game this awesome.  I started a game and immediatly lost track of time. I swear, I was in that game for 15 minutes but the session time said 2 hours. Your life will go to this game, I promise. Huge pro is the fact you never really have to buy things with real money, unless you truly want to. Because, if you're lucky, you can find it for free in a round, which I think is perfect, and will keep me playing for a long time. I've only been playing for 5 days, and my small amount of hours is because I'm still in school, but I would HIGHLY recommend this to anybody that enjoys first person shooters or anything action. An amazing game with a huge fanbase, I love it."
"So...this game is incredibly fun ! the community is amazing (most of players are funny and friendly) and if you fall in the trading community you'll never get out of here ! trading is the best thing that ever hapenned to me in this game ^^ i really enjoy playing &amp; trading around, so just install this game and start having fun !"
"That's the most awesome game i ever played!So many maps to play,hats to wear,weapons to kill.I'll never stop to playing that game!"
The only 3d game my cheap pc can handle
"A pretty fun game, I got addicted pretty quick."
Best game since 1969. Can't stop playin' won't stop playin . Its like pokemon but with HATS
Its great I love it.
I'm still waiting for a Walrus Tophat.
The best war-themed hat simulator I've ever played!
"A very cool Free to Play game definitly pick it up if you got some free time to waste. At the moment very balanced as well, all the nine classes really fit into the game. Which is really important because in most games that has diffrent classes there is always an overpowered/overplayed one. Valve should put more time in its competitive scene tho."
Good Game..... I Guess.... Can be a little addicticing.... 
This is the funniest shooting game I ever play :)
"Team Fortress 2 offers a great weapons system, rewarding gameplay, and many other things that just make it the amazing game that it is.  -9.5/10  *note I haven't finished this review, I'll write a longer version when I have the time."
"Best class based shooter ever! Hats and trading just adds another dimention of fun, and theres a lot of great youtubers who play this game. Definately recommended."
Best free game on steam !!! :D
Awesome Game! Completely free to play but you can get a ton of hats if you go premium! TF2 is a pretty balanced game too. Definitely recommend this game
"An MLG game to play, its a First Person Shooter and it has a cartoon genre. You can be 9 different classes, each class has their weakness and an ability, so there is no OP in TF2. There is a dozen of cosmetics and weapons in the game. :D  I will recomment this game for FPS (First Person Shooting) gamers."
"The game. #gaben  Anyway, this is a fun game. Just don't be a chainsaw ♥♥♥♥♥♥ killer.(tryhard) Also don't try to get distracted by the game within the game, which is a simulation. What?(trading)  After a while, the game really grows on you. Unless you lag. A lot."
"Hat simulator. Now with guns,"
"TF2 is a fun, objective-and-class based FPS with a Cartoon/Silly design and hilarious voice acting and class personalities. Althogh it was released in 2007, the release of new updates that include hats, weapons, and maps have kept this train from slowing down. It's even F2P, and as a F2P yuo get the entire experince of weapons (and occasionaly hats) just from the games item-drop system. Also, the learning curve is tough if you are used to stuff like C.O.D or BattleField or whatever. Either way, this is a hell of alot of fun!"
its an awsome game! recommended to many people
Dis game is so awesome &lt;3
Probably the best free 2 play game on Steam!!!
One of the best games ive ever played. (4.6 stars)
"I really liked this game, go play it and you will see."
"Amzing F2P game, Must try, Recommended 9/10"
one of the best games i have ever played
"This is a great game, I like it a lot."
"Funsies, also known a virtual cocaine, I love it"
truly the best free game on steam 
"Why shouldn't you get it, its an amazing game."
"Best game I have ever played! GET IT, if you haven't already... IT's FREEEEEEEEE"
"This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels.  There are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'.  Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objectives for both teams to achieve.  'Mann Verses Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, 'Mann Up', gives rewards upon completing a 'tour'.  In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them.   I really like the game :)"
"i like the hats, weapons, and miscs. 10/10"
Very Addictice
I'm really bad yet I find it really fun
It's a great f2p shooter if not even one of the best one out there. There's a great weapon balance and isn't a pay to win game at all like most of the f2p games. You could call this game Hat fortress 2.    10/10 Like CoD but with hats - IGN
This is my favorite game ever made! I will play this without stopping 24/7! I think everone should play this game.
HATS N' HATS seriouslly now: so many posibilities of gameplay and so much fun with friends HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATS f2p and at least 0.01 to make premium so 1000000000/10
You should be playing this now!
Great and fun game with very funny characters but those expensive hats though ugh
"Meh, I got bored of it but its fun at first"
Brilliant game and cannot get enough of it if only they implemented competitive within the game this game would explode onto the comp community alongside CS:GO
"What is there to say about Tf2 that has not already been said? Not much really so I am going to try and keep this short. This game has some of the best class based mechanics that can be found in any FPS. Each class is different and provides a different style of play to have fun with, and that is just the stock characters. Customization is one of this games strong points, in what other game can I jump across a map with a pink beard and hat and then proceed to smash a shovel into a friends face causing them to endlessly rage? There is a reason that people still play this after 7 years. TF2 has taken many hours of my life, and I'm fine with that as longs as it continues to stay awesome I will spend many more hours in the future. 'Arf'- Walruse"
"Fun game,has two aspects,playing the game normally and trading,both are fun to try,recommended"
awesome game but sadly it became free to play :(
This game is the best ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great
A really cool multiplayer game to play with friends I would recommend it to anyone really.
The world's best F2P game! :)
"insanely fun,but i hope valve sees this: i think they should add some sort of like check to play this game,to many young kids and squeakers and trollers on this game today,kinda ruins my fun i used to have. over all one of my most favriote games ever."
Great Game
TF2 on october 17 2000121212
"Amazing game, One of the greatest, If not, The greatest animated game ever!!!!"
"Very awesome FREE game! Great for people who love FPS.   Also, HATS!!!"
Team Fartress 2 is a gud game. I liek it.
Nice game... Good waste of life and money
It's fun Play it
nice very nice MVM is best fighting robots because you being hero on last wave
You should play it! It's fun! Very fun. I just want this badge.
"Completely addictive! I cant stop playing this game because its so fun! All the classes, weapons, and hats make this game a great first-person shooter game"
I love this game :)   DBS and DB Voogru servers are amazingly awesome :D
Nice easy and fun! That's all! [And it's free]
BEST FPS IN THE WORLD
"Everything you could really want from a game. Tons of weapons, headgear and misc. items to play around with. Updated frequently, although sometimes pointlessly. Addicting gameplay, appealing visuals and 9 unique classes to choose from. And best of all, this is all free. It's not pay-to-win; all the items in the store can be found through drops in-game. However, you might feel a bit left out if you don't have a hat or two like all your buddies."
"One of the best first person shooters I've ever seen and theres tons of things to do. Theres different tactics, you can customize your loadout and what he looks like and what weapons he uses, buy items from the market located in the community tab (also be careful not to get addicted to buying things I learned that the hard way.), buy items from the tf2 store located in tf2 (But be warned you get much better deals from the market.), You can have bragging rights from murdering your friends and taunting at the freezecam, play mvm (mann vs machine) and kill lots and lots of robots. and all of this? I mean once you play this. You'll be wondering, why is this free?"
Conga'ed past a Sentry and died.  10/10 would conga again.
Excellent FPS. Nice team play. Great for LAN parties...for those of us who still keep that dream alive.
Just the thing Medic ordered for when you've had a bad day.
"This is the epitome of a perfect example, for instance, of something that is really good. COD campers are nowhere to be found except in the form of camping: Cloaked Spies Smoking Hot Pyros Medic + Heavy Ubercharged Duo Group of Engineers+Teleporter+Sentries Rocket Spamming Soldiers Sticky-grenading Demomanz Ridiculously Accurate MLG Headshotting Sniperz  10/10 wouldn't not recommend"
"i think this is a great game anyone that likes fps must get this game, it's funny, somewhat derpy, and very competitive."
is very good its cinda futer based but not to futer based is collect items to be op so is very good over all
Its a nice game
its good
It's a wonderful game that I have played for some weeks and months. It has grown on to me for some weeks thinking if this is good or not. For some days and weeks has past I finally thought it was a good game. It's a fantastic game with great animation for a shooting game. If you don't believe try yourself and see how great it is. -MoonJoker891   P.S Don't take this game to serious for it won't be fun for you.
yo man i used to play this game everyday before my laptop crashed but now i've got a brand new windows 8 and im ready to continue pwning in this fine sport  
aswome
One of the most fun games ever made.
great game recomend to anyone who likes fps games
"The game is fun. For such a massive multiplayer, decently good graphics. Minor lag problems; probably due to other gamer's internet capabilities. Overall, very well made game."
"Very fun game, I enjoy the fact that Valve is constantly changing the game and fixing the bugs."
Good game mate.
THIS IS JUST WOW!!
its som coo;l
I've spent too much money on this game to turn back. Anyways I &lt;3 this game.
One of the best games on steam. ever.
"If you like classic looking games, first person shooters, teamwork, and randomness, this is the game for you. This game introduces 9 different classes with different weapons and playstyles. 9/10. Even though it's one of the best games I've played, it has alot of bugs. Besides these bugs, this game makes me want to play it all day"
this game is cool
"This game is hours of great fun, but the community has suffered a bit since it became f2p. I have played team fortress 2 for more than 700 hours, and i still play it regularly."
this game is awesome 
great game! been playing it for years and it has never made me bored once.
It's Team Fortress 2.... there's not really much that can be said other than that's it's awesome and won't get old anytime soon. :D
"'Uhm, I don't even know where to start with you.' This is one of those games that is so different, it's great. This is the first game that I've ever played that has established some sort of economy system. Some people would frown upon this game because of it's graphics and cartoonish feel (Which some people like). Another aspect that I enjoy is the customization. Valve adds user-created items to the game via the workshop, so a great amount of the ideas are from the community. Team Fortress 2 is by far one of my most favorite games of all time.  11/10"
"This is a very balanced, fast paced non traditional fps that is a hell of a lot of fun. Each class offers a different style of gameplay ranging from pyro, a destructive and offensive class, to spy, a supportive stealth class. Every class has their strengths and weaknesses, and teamwork for this reason is essential because every class can be countered by another class. Playing with balanced teams is very rewarding because it takes a group effort to win in any situation. I strongly reccomend this game to others and ill be plaing it for a long time."
as[ofajs[fa!!!
the game has hats what else would you want? seirously tho the game is extremely addicting wether youre the trading fanatic the hardened veteran or the a newb the game has lots to offer the 9 classes are all distinct with all their pros and cons even if the game is 7 years old valve still updates it adding new hats weapons maps and recently taunts the amount of care this game has got i great comparing it w other f2p games even with its microtransactions the game is balanced and item drops happen to everyone so the homeless 12 year olds get some stuff 100000000000/10
Something something hats.
This Game Have Too Much TeamWork And This Is Why I Like This TEAMWORK GAME ARE THE BEST My Rate For This Game 99999999/10
the best game that i have been played before
I recomend tf2 for new players to get started for othere games its the top of game you would play for fun and play Co-op and much more just play it its awesome Mvm too is good but Mvm is much harder than a normal tf2 game Thank you for reading this and goodbye!
This Game Is Awesome :D
"If you want to have a great time, buy this ♥♥♥♥, Gibuses and endless fun, Ladies and gents. TF2 is GREAT!"
This game is so much fun in every way. There is a character for every style of play.
"This game is amazing even though the hat prices in the mann,co store might bust ur wallet there is always the community market and backpack.tf. Gameplay is amazing the classes depend on each other making you feel like a team and doing your part well cause its team fortress 2 not hero fortess 2 pub servers are good but if you want to have a greater challenge play in lobby servers or highlander servers. But there are some downfalls in this amazing game the derped players  mostly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ medics are the bane of your good time cause they will only heal ONE GUY and ignore you while your burning and dying. Anyway this game is amazing for what it is. each class is unique and fresh. IF YOU NEVER PLAYED THIS GAME YOUR MISSING OUT!"
hard but very very fun the gameplay is very good and the community is epic
"Tf2 is a fun fps, which I really enjoy playing. It's not only for one person, it fits everybody's style. Say your a fast paced player, then play as a scout. If you rack up tons of kills, you get rewarded, and you constantly get new items. This makes Tf2 one of the best steam games, of all time."
Team Fortress 2 is an awesome game in which you do many things such as control points or capture the flag. The game is amazing and the plot is good. This is one of the best games out there!
"This game is an amusing Free-To-Play Game that is very easy to play, with minimal effort. It is very unique in the sense that there are certain roles that every class has, not just 'SHEWT DA BAD GUYZ' I recommend this game to EVERYONE who plays class based First Person Shooters, or likes Valve games. If you like any of Valve's other games, You'll love this!"
"TF2 won't ever replace Battlefield: Heroes for me, but its a good game in the same genre nonethless. Its good."
I spy with my little eye!
"This is fast becoming my favorite game! I simply cant belive it is free! The community is awesome! and the developers provide exelent atention to detail. This game can easy be worth 50$ in the current free state! You can buy cool hats for charecters to support the developers and personally I would like to do so, so we can have this game for free for years to come, and possibly a TF3 in the future."
"This is very very good game! For me is this game one of my the best games, that I played. Thos is, I think, the first multiplayer shooter with classes. You can craft your weapons, you can trade with other players, you can customize your character. These are things, that isn't any multiplayer shooter, that I know. Also when you're wanna some multiplayer shooter to gaming, I am recommending for you THIS!  Team Fortress 2"
Best game i have ever played! If you havent played this game before go ahead but still DO NOT take it that seriosly! I mean you can try to get kills but seriosly the game is not meant to be taken seriosly... You know what i mean when you try it out by yourself! 1# Game ever!
A very fun way to kill boredom and a fun way to kill your enemies. :D
"Team Fortress 2 is by far the best F2P game on Steam. Great FPS mechanics, versitile but balanced characters, and a vibrant economy. Hats!"
"Amazing game, although my friend had to get me a $5.00 p2p its fine. (The Mann Co. store ripped me off on those taunts though)"
"I have to be honest here, I love this game. Was addicted to it for a very long time. Have almost 2k hours and spent $459.86 on hats and keys and tickets.  I still fully recommend this game because it's free, the community tends to be rather nice, it's fun with friends, and can be really really fun.  My only problem with it is it's slowly dying and many can see that. The updates are getting less and less spectacular and slowly and slowly the game is getting less and less fun. The new weapons/weapon ideas sound great, but ingame the few new weapons they give us aren't that spectacular. Many, like i once was, become obsessed with trading and lose the fun in the game.  I still strongly recommend this game, it's just I feel my opinion of the game is slowly getting worse and worse. Hopefully some future updates will change that."
I enjoy this game alot and it funny.
World's best hat simulator.
really have fun with this game
GET it it's free and amazing
"Team Fortress 2 is packed with action, strategy and FUN !! This game is definitely recommended to any gamer who likes quick reaction and just having fun with friends."
This game is awsome and fun to play
this game is soo fun
"Addictive as hell and after almost 3 years of playing, it's still entertaining!"
This is by far one of my most favorite games!
"This game might just be the best game on the store, free, valve, and vun! (medic pun)"
"Really good Game, like it."
"A cartoon-like shooter. If you haven't tried it, you should. It requires a lot of practice to get into it, and while you practice you can get various items to use. It's easy to get addicted to this game, because every time you want to quit you get a new item that makes you want to keep going. It's fun and fast paced, and keeps you on edge all the time."
This is is a really fun game with tons of content.
A very great game indeed. A must play game and....... it's FREE!! Another game made by Valve. I recommend playing this game!
H A T S  I T ' S A L L T H A T M A T T E R S
Best game that is free. A really good game to start you life with steam or to start playing games from steam. Valve you did an amazing job.
"This game changed my life.  It saw me through the ups and downs and was always there for me, waiting to pull me into its embrace like an old friend.  Never has a video game done that for me before. It is not a question of whether or not you will play Team Fortress 2. It is a question of how many years you will play it. I've played it now for 3 years and am still going strong.   It is as silly or as serious as you want it to be. I've done everything in it from competing in professional LAN tournaments to just goofing off with friends in a private server.   So, if you haven't tried this game - what are you waiting for? Just play it. Get past the initial learning curve and I promise you will love this game like I have.   So go on. Play it. Players like me will be waiting to welcome you."
"TF2  What do you think when you hear or see these two letters and one number?  I see a game that is fun to play, enjoyable, has still got a lot of potential (even though it has been around for 7-8 years now), the game can get boring if you play it non stop, but I started playing it around 2011 then played it for a year or two and then quit for some time. Now its 2015 i came back to it and i feel like its a fresh game for me.  So because its free and can be learned very quickly there is almost no reason not to download it."
Commendable game. Makes me remember my childhood memories. Keep up the good work!.
Nice game !
Team fortress 2 is a classic game one that will never stop being fun a revolutionary game for pc. 
"This game is fun, and would reccomend to all"
teamfortress two is a pretty cool game
"Its fun, its Free (but would reccomend spending a small amout) and its the most fun you can have on the internet!"
"It's a perfect game. You are always updated with new incredible releases. It is a masterpiece from Valve. The game is very fun, with 9 characters to choose from who each have their advantages and disadvantages. Overall the game is very balanced and great fun!"
great fps
I recommend people to play this game if you are a meatball 
"love the game, played 374 hours still not bored of it. I admit it is a bit of a pay to win but the general gameplay and encounters is fun and the characters are comical and witty. The taunts are a good idea and the ridiculus weapons are so much fun like the huntsman and rocket jumper. I can list alot more. Generally a great free to play game. Well done Valve"
Amazing and fun game!
INCREDIBLE and addicting ive had this game for a month now and ive clocked in 104 hours
"this game is a realy great game. it has tons of weapons, items, and most importantly, hats!"
Very fun game and excellent trading side!
Funny... and great game to play with friends :D
"In short, this FPS is uniquie.  What i mean by that? Most of FPS avaliable to aquire are military shooters. They tend to be really serious one, where having a good killing spree or doing great at playing objective is main thing You focus on, but TF2 isn't that one. It places fun over those two, where in other situations fun was somewhere below. For example when You kill other player in some fancy way and other one from opposing team will see this, then there is good chance that except of trying to kill You, he might give You thumbs up and go his way (but don't start thinking that everyone will do this!). Sometimes players from opposing teams stop to shoot to each other just to walk around and have some fun with voice commands. Yes, I have to agree that 'friendliness' appears in many other FPS's but here it's most common.  Other than just having fun TF2 offers 9 classes. Hah, You may think its nothing new, but hell no. Each of those classes are allmost completly different, and they allmost always have pretty much good counters (except snipers ofc. Those are always problem in every FPS) And same map and same players, but playing different class will change whole perspective of gameplay (just in this situations 9 games in 1).  I can say that TF2 isn't just a one game, It's combination of them! Those are things that will give You completly new experience while playing Team Fortress 2 - Rocket jumping - Sticky jumping - Sentry jumping - Surf maps - Zombie Fortress maps - Dogdeball - Smash bros maps - Death run maps - Trick stabs - Shortcuts for each maps - Even griefing - And many more  If You don't know what any of those means, than You should get into Team Fortress 2 right now.  So If You are bored of those military shooters out there and want to try something new, than check it out!"
i think the gameplay super fun
worst top down fighting simulation my nan has ever been filmed in.
It's real purty
If you like FPS games this is the best games
Good Game It's Entertaining...
"This game is fun for competitive players, people who just want to mess around, and people who enjoy trading items. Best hat simulator I've ever played.(That last line was a joke)"
Free to play and fun if your into objectives.
"Not your average fps. Your previous experiance does not carry over into tf2. Keep an open mind if coming from console, or any other fps. This is a great game, would recommend. Hint, when you start, go either soldier, or demoman, because you have to predict motion, which comes in handy for hitscan weapons and looking where people will go before they go there."
very good game lol
"Team Fortress 2, has to be the most amazing game I have played on steam. It is full of challenging achivements. I like how there is a class for every type of personality. It is nice how you can custom make your mercenary to your liking. I perfer playing the pyro. I can not say one negative thing about TF2. Everything from cosmetics to video of TF2 are simply awesome. Playing TF2 has brought out my inner gamer. Thanks to my husband, I am now getting to experiance the virtual world that gaming has to offer."
"It's an awesome cartoony FPS, that provides a lot of fun! There are various gameplay elements, the movement can have surprising depth, and you can play the game in various different ways. There are 9 distinct classes, and each one has a lot of different weapons, gamemodes and maps. Also, you can personalize your character with hundreds of hats and cosmetic items.  The game also features periodic updates, adding even more maps, cosmetics and weapons.  I surely recommend it!"
"This game is awesome,I totally recommand trying it and i guarantee you will love it.Altough dear Valve cant makean update without breaking a weapon or gamemode i support their work."
IS THE BESSSTTTT 
"I like TF2,alot because you get new itemz every day. and i really like that... and its a shooter game,and awsome stuff."
It's a good game. The engineer is pretty fun.
undoubtedly the best free game on the market
BEST GAME IN THE WORLD!! WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!
yes i recomed for the steam xp
"Best FPS ever made? No. Best Multiplayer FPS? Probaly... Yes, but not in full. Best FPS Multiplayer and funny games? Yes. :D"
"Not new user friendly. Gamplay is overal fun. The mod servers are fun. MvM is a fun game mode if you have the money. You don't have to spend money to get better weapons if you are willing to play the waiting game or trade. This game will take some time getting use to the classes. That means, people that played only, Cod or, Bf, will have a tough time. Don't let better players get the best of you. Take your time. You'll eventually get better. Worth the download."
"This game is super fun and cool. Here are some reasons : Taunts, Cosmetics, Custom maps, Comics, Event maps, Custom gamemodes, etc.. Team Fortress 2 is just a great game of fun !"
"Boisterous and engaging. If you're wondering whether or not to give it a try, just do it!"
it's a litle hard to win weapons put the game is cool
Team fortress 2 is a fun class based multiplayer game. The selection of classes makes this game unique in many different ways the classes are well balanced but have diffenent skills and weaknesses. I would definatley reccomend this game to any new steam member as it is free to play and offers hours of fun.
Very good game. love playing. and seriously recommend u getting!
i cant stop playing it! it is just so amazing... 
This is one of my favourite game's i play Team Fortress 2 almost everyday and its free so i can have free fun everyday this truly is a great game and i would recommend this game to everyone 100%.
Team Fortress 2 is a very fun game with alot of action in it. There are 9 different classes making it more fun cause most Free To Play games only have about 3-4 classes! You can play as each one get hats and miscs for them and even many different taunts like the conga! There are also many different wepons to each class! There are so a many different types of game modes like pay load is where you have to push a cart holding a bomb into a hole. You have saxton hale where there is one guy and your whole team try's to fight him (Also known as Vsh). There is cp which is control points which you try to capture the other teams control points to win the game (Most recommended to play for starters). Then you have much much more when you start to play Team Fortress 2. I hope you found this review helpful!
pro:fun to spend time playing con: boring after 2000 hrs
Wanna an excelent free game? This is the answer.
"I think this game is pretty good, there are many new features and stuff coming often which makes it funny because of the new 'abilities'."
This game is the beast.
Thanks valve for creating this game THX
"Pretty good hat crafting simulator.  I found myself deeply immersed in the intense grinding for metals and whatnot to create that perfect hat just for me. I was impressed by the realism. TF2 really knows what it's doing here, almost as if the developers went camping at a hat factory in order to research what to do when creating this game.  You can spend hours, days, even months just sitting around crafting hats. It truly is impressive and a lot of fun.  Constant updates means there's always a new hat to craft and add to your collection.  You can also aquire 'taunts' which will pose your character in silly and cool ways to show off your amazing hat.  This is the game.  10/10"
"I kid you not, this game is like a cocaine for me."
"I would definitely reccomend this game to new players on steam, or veterans. This is a bit late of a review for me, but it's a free first person shooter with many unique mechanics that can make the game a new original expierience for a variety of players. The game is incredibly balanced in most aspects, although some players would tend to disagree. Generally good overall!"
3 years later I still play 8 hours a week. I probably have a problem.
Best free to play game on steam by far!
Probably my favorite game. So much to do and so much fun to have!
10/10 wouldn't care if people kill me
Very good game!
this game is awesome! :D
"Dis game made up my childhood dis game is fun, and isnt mindless like call of duty team death match. this requires TEAMWORK and a wide range of skills, my favorite thing about tf2 is that they have checks and balances so everything is a chalange no matter if you are the heavy, or the engi you will find challenges and oppurtintes to push your team"
literally so good
7.8/10 Too many hats
:)
i luv this game
"I love this game so much,starting from back then when it was included in Orange Box. There was a brief moment when i hated the game because of many items and F2P,but now I actually appreciate the game development. Still coming back to playing TF2 almost every week....LOVE IT. "
this game is very good and i reckamend it to eny one how i have mate
"Extraordinary game, it has still potential to develop and has already seen tremendous development. Made to a high quality in which everyone can enjoy through its amazing community that support the developers. It has been one of the best games I have ever played and I recommend it to a wide variety of age groups. "
I love it 'Nuf said 
Great and fast paced game
"Fun game, very addictive."
"Great game then The economy fell back on itself, if you're a trader like me I do not recommend playing this if you are a trader. But it is a fun game to PLAY."
I spent more money on this than my Electric bill.
This is the best free game on steam and is flexible with any budget
it's kind of okay
amazing 10/10 my faveroute game after skyrim deserves all the attention it gets my fave pc game.
if you enjoy wearing hats then this is the game for you
Great game 10/10
"I played it for a couple of miniutes, its good."
Yeah its pretty awesome
Best hat simulator ever created.. people say theres multiplayer and guns but i dont belive them
Really fun FPS shooter.
"This game is special for me because i have almoast 3,700 h on it but it keeps me going back with warius updates and items added in the updates!"
Is very god ...se it love arms and win weapons....
this is a great way to create a pc gamer because this is free and fun. 5 out of 5
Endless fun and free as well..
  It's free    It's Fun   HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATS!!!!!!!!!  
'10/10 like COD with hats' -IGN
Died getting hit by a fish  10/10
"Good game, i like it because of the people you see. all you have to do is not be salty, and if you are dont spread it around lol."
Great game
Good game to play if you are always bored.Always new weapons you will find in the game so you will never get bored of it.If you have not downloaded the game do it now.Team fortress 2 is a game that will always be the best first person shooter in my opinion.
emptied my wallet  10/10 would spend money on virtual items again
Really great game and The update also
"It's a great game and a great time sink. Easy to get into hard to master, this game barely needs a review at all its free and has a long running history of being a great game. You have nothing to lose by trying this game."
"i want to say its the best free to play game i have ever played because it is free and doesnt require u to pay at all, but i cant. lately there has been a problem with alot of people where if you press the voice chat button, the game freezes, if they could fix this then i would say 10/10 will play forever. but until then i say its a 6/10. i want to be able to voice chat with friends again but with this bug i cant so. anyone who reads this, try to get valve to notice this glitch because i know im no the onlyone with it, and try to get them to fix it"
one of the best games ive ever played
"Bored of CoD and Battlefield? TF2 is a perfect replacement. This game takes way more skill, but once you get good you can totally own. Plus, it's really fun with friends. 4.5/5 is my rating for TF2. Play it now!"
great game
"A very overrated free to play online FPS made by the people who won't release the next Half-Life game. But hey, it's free! And it's got a lot of hats!"
Awesome..just the best free to play game that you can ever have on Steam :)
"I'm not even sure how I want to review this game. I love it and I hate it so much.  Welcome to Team Fortress 2, one of the most unique First Person Shooters out there. What makes it so unique? The cartoony art style and and humour in the game definitely makes it stand out from generic grimdark shooters. It uses a class based system that is incredibly well fleshed out, and you absolutely need to have teamwork if you want to succeed. Each class is very different and have different strengths and weaknesses. Beyond that, there are so many things to do in the game. Those that want to goof around can be friendly heavies offering their sandwich to people, players that want to focus on the unique movement system can hone their rocket jumping skills in a jump map, etc. There is even co-op mode where you fight against waves of AI controlled robots if you are looking for a less competitive experience.   Of course, if you are looking to play the game at all. The Team Fortress 2 community is split into 2 groups of people; traders and those who just regularly play the game. Within Team Fortress is an item system where you can find new items to equip for your character. Sometimes you get new weapons or you can get lucky and find a hat to further customize your character. You can also find crates, which are basically Valve's way of getting money out of you. you have to buy a key from the ingame store to open them, and they contain rare items that can only be achieved from said crate, or a very small chance at getting an unusual hat (Basically a regular hat with a particle effect that hovers over your head). These are so sought after that you can sell them on the Market for hundreds of dollars. So one half of the players get enthused by the idea of RMT and trading and forgo playing the actual game; they just sit around and wait for item drops, trading, and spending money opening crates and hoping they get lucky enough to make some money. This system becomes addicting and harmful, it creates you into something like Sato from the NHK as he tries to replace his real job with RMT (Excuse my weebshit reference). It creates phishers and scammers; people who want these rare items so badly they will rip off other people or try to steal people's accounts to get them. This part of the community can be incredibly toxic, to the point where people who spend money on the game act as elitists and shun those do not care about cosmetics or trading. Of course, not all trading is bad when it's just in fun. Trading an item you don't like for an item you want is a great system, but it brings out the worst in people if they overindulge themselves with it.  All in all, Team Fortress 2 is an incredibly diverse game, and accomodates any kind of player. Your experience will vary vastly on -how- you want to play the game, but no matter what you decide to do, the game is loads of fun. There is endless replayability and huge communities of all sorts. I would reccomend Team Fortress 2 to all kinds of gamers."
"Very fun game, recommended to those who never tried it out already! :D"
Wow... No review can't express how different this game is from any other shooter.  So many fun additions in this game make it more enjoyable than it already is....       COSMETICS
Yes ots a nice FPS Game
You should get this game.
very fair and balenced game
You'll be sucked into a world of hats and SFM animations and invishackers and before you know it you'll have spent 12 dollars so that your Texan can sit in a chair and drink beer while your turret kills everyone.  Fun!
There has never been a better community-building tool than this game.
"  good game, lots of fun and consistent"
"TF2 is an excellent FPS. As it is a Free-To-Play game, some features are not unlocked. In order to trade you have to purchase a TF2 item in the Mann Co. store in order to obtain premium status."
Best game i have played in a while . nice that its free to play and involves the comunity 
This game is good! I like it
"A pretty good game but beware of LAG is so laggy but is a ton of fun! One of the best games ever played with a million o guns and cosmetics this game os the more distracting for somebody who loves FPS's is just what the key wor winning in this game is in one cosmetic and then you are a boss, if not then you will live forever n00b without skillz FOREVER In conclusion... IS FUN"
This game is dogsht and we're still playing it  Send help
This is a great game with 9 differant classes and is highly addictive
"This game is a absolute masterpiece in the FPS genre. High quality graphics, co-op, amazing gameplay, tons of game modes. I highly and I mean HIGHLY recommend this game for your collection."
"Well, what to say that hasn't been said? First of all the updates, all adding something new and fresh (maybe not End Of The Line, bonus ducks aren't a 'new idea'). Then there's the community, from newbies with gibuses, to pros with Unusuals of all kinds and sorts. I love every single one of them for making this game what it is, from the congars, the traders and yes, even the W + M1nners. All of them make this game a unique and completely diverse experience every time. In short a 10/10 with no cons whatsoever."
0/10 not enuff b00b frum mis pauly
This game is one of the best around. You should try this game 3rd or 2nd top free game  
"Such variety as far as classes, weapons and game modes(maps) and its free!"
Help team push. Dies. Autobalance. Get rekt by old teammates.  10/10 will play again.
"Great game to play with friends and just have some fun. I give it a 9/10. Gaben is love, gaben is life."
It's a really good game
It's a pretty cool game. 'sniff'.
Great game!!
"One Fantastic, Amazing, Bloody, Funny, Multiplayer Game"
"I mean I havent played this game that much, but I guess you can say Its alright."
"Amazing comedy shooter, nothing like CoD or Battlefield"
"This is the greatest game ever, and congratz! Happy 15th birthday TF2."
Why am I still playing this?
The game that got me to where my steam proifle is now. An amazing game with a great comunity
Real life? What language is that from?
"This is the best free to play Valve game ever. If you like first person shooters and shooting people and guns and teamwork, this game is for you."
this game is awesome 
"This game is very awsome and all but the one thing that is bothering me is the pyro's sex. The firts thing that got people questining about this theory is out-of-place purse put in the pyro locker. Now we can all asume it as a mystery and make it remane as he being a she, but i say no more that im about to crack the case that wether pyro is a guy or girl. Firts we need to look at his size and his digit to ratio fingers and see and look at them. The pyros fingers are longer than the females fingers but if you look..... wait you just stoped looking and checked on your fingers didnt you wel see its not that complex anyways as i was saying the pyro is pretty much a male because a males digit fingers are longer than females and also do to his behavor. He could be female or homo sexual male and the real anwser is...... that hes a homo sexual male. Hope you enjoyed this theory and sorry if it make much sense if you want to go see the actuall video look up 'the game theorist'."
"Even in all the craziness that is happening inside and outside this game, it still holds as one of the best FPSs."
"Simply put: this game should be worth way more than it is. I mean free? Really? For the price, and really any other amount, you will not find a better game. It has everything a GREAT game needs: unique characters to fit your personality, energetic fast paced gameplay, an extensive inventory of collectible weapons and items, and a community that is absolutely amazing! The ability to not only blow people sky high with the various weapons, but also looking like a boss while doing so... AWESOME!!!!    173927463/10 for being flat out awesome."
Awsome game with many cool weapons and hats
Dont play this game if you dont like hats.
please help me
"This game is simply amazing. Valve really put a lot of effort into making this game, And they did a darn good job."
Get it before Valve learns how to count to 3.
Its pretty awesome and the graphics are awesome too.
This game really sucks in a good way that is good Just made a haiku
"Even though this game is really old and new paid games are being released, I always seem to come back to this game.   If u havent played it, m8 ur missing out!"
"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.  Eat."
One word. Mannrobics.  10/10.
Its gud
its a really fun game
Play for fun Play for free TF2 a great game for lovers of cartoonish graphics and a whacky set of classes!
"I, honestly, don't know why I'm even reviewing this game. Its a great game, with a great community (as long as you respect friendlies, you're kinda golden ), a good trading economy ( backpack.tf price are changing constantly, but some people use those prices in trading, so it helps to look at it ), A ever changing set of weapons ( but not reskins. Those suck ), and diffrences in charactors. But ,I'll be honest here, if you think this game is ANYTHING like cod, and play it and start saying that cod is better, prepare to have your flame shield up, for you shall be hated. By everyone.    Err... I think I have to explain this for anyone new.... Here we go, things that people do that don't work in tf2: 1) NEVER stay on that heavy as a medic. Your team will die, since you're just staying behind that fat guy with a big gun. At least heal your teams. Please ;-; 2) Those 'Meet The Team' trailers are NOT acurate. Scout can't dodge everything, Engies can't have more than one sentry, And so on and so forth. 3) Don't just move in a straight line, holding down your fire button with the flamethrower. You'll die. It also has horrible range, and can't be used it water (I'm looking at you, random noob who held down his flamethrower in the water on 2Fort. ばか) . 4) If you shoot that heavy holding his sandvich, ducking in the corner, prepare for both hate and death. 5) This is a review. Why am I telling you this bull crap.  Little side notes; If you go on goggle translate, ばか=baka=idiot. Did it for ya ( ° ͜ʖ °)"
One of the best games ive ever played

"Hats, hats, hats, hats? oh you gabe..."
So much fun. Taunts and sandviches.
"It's a cool game, F2P or P2P. You need skill, not COD skills."
"After a year of playing, I can finally say this game is worth it. If you survive past the gibus hate and all the yelling of first month, you're there to stay. Needs comp."
Love this game! It is always my goto thing to do when I have free time
"I can't say about this game, I don't have enough hours into it. Yet so far its good.                         I sold my soul to Gaben in this game. 10/10"
"THIS GAME...IT'S, IT'S, AMAZING!"
"This game is absolutely amazing! Game is from 2007 and It has full servers, awesome community, addicting gameplay and best of all constant updates! I really love games that can be played forever, and TF2 never get's boring. How much I win, get excited, how much I rage, lose or get good items it never get's boring. Game is pure miracle, and best part it's free to Play. This game deserves you money for Premium uprgade and it's not expensive. All in all TF2 is amazing game, with good graphics, funny cartoonish characters, very good voice acting and nice music. With huge amount of cosmetics and weapons it makes it pure fun! I recommend this to any kind of people! Verdict: Amazing + Good Cartoonish Graphics + Good Amount of Weapons and Cosmetics + Alot Gamemodes + Cool Classes with Amazing Voice Acting + Really Good Gameplay - Game is Cruel if You are New to the Game"
10/10 would play again
Graphics: All you gore and cartoony needs  Characters: Balenced fun easy to understand.  Socialising: Great other than annoying kids who think it's funny to make not so funny noises  Time Usage: Very addicting (As you can see my hours) and defintley not time wasting!  Wepons and Such: Wepons are fun are well balenced. Miscs hats ect. Are decrated well and can be custimized well.  Maps &amp; Modes: Maps are pretty spacouis and fun are suitable for all classes. Modes are fun and I enjoy the beta games. 
Team Fortress 2 is a great game with a great community. I have played it for about a year and it never gets old. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
"it's my baby, wich I allow you to play with."
I like this game its the best game!
"Hands down one of the best games i've ever played. The TF2 community is awesome, I've met so many good people through this game. I can't say enough about it, you won't regret downloading it."
"This game is very good, one of the most cartoony games on steam. The community makes this game great, still waiting for an major update (Competitive) I have 800+ hours, so I have some sence of it. Here are some Pros &amp; Cons. Pros : Nice gameplay! Very unique. Good detailed characters &amp; weapons You can mod the game in any way you can (Custom HUDS, player models,...) Friendly players Noob friendly Cons : Prices for some items are too damn high! Too few maps that aren't complicated Respawn time for 20 seconds sometimes feels like a hour. Reliance on your other players can break the gameplay fun. You need to have some strategic sence. Well, that was my review, I hope you liked it! Final verdict : Very good polished game, has some good gameplay but you really need to rely on your teammates. Some maps are very complicated, some are very good for noobies and some have a favor for a team."
Tons of weapons. Tons of stuff to make you look unique. Tons of great people. Tons of fun.
"I used to think hats were a fashion accessory, but it turns out they are valid currency."
An amazing game only remembered to write a review about it now but ive been playing this game for ages because i cant get bored of it :)
"awsome game , nice game content"
Very great free-to-play fps game 10/10
Its a very good game to play with friends
Quite an enjoyable game. Exceedingly fun to play. A game with super cool effects applied to cosmetics which is extremely expensive. 10/10
It's my faveorite game of all time and I highly suggest it!
Really nice f2p game
"What can I say 'bout this game that everybody on this planet can't know, already... IT'S F**KING DAMN GOOD AND ADICTIVE! PLAY IT NOW!!! It will ruin my studying and faculty X-D! 420/69 blaze it!"
It's so much fun I can play for hours if I could!
Why are you watching rewievs just play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game already!
10/10 i love this game more than my family
It's a pretty fun game where you can play as mercenaries that like to dress up and dance the conga.   Fifth spy on the team/5
"Welp time to re-do all of this, If you're into FPS and F2P... This is a perfect game to play, not only there's friendly players', you can also get free items. Yes, a F2P Gives you free items while you play it. Even hats ETC. Anywho lets get to the gameplay. I've put LOTS of time into this, I started back in 2011. I was gonna buy it but... You know, I was still very new to steam. I should've had bought this though. The gameplay is great, all of the classes are balanced and very fun to play. Ah getting a triple kill with Sniper gotta love it. If you're new to Tf2, we all welcome you to it. Just don't teleport bread!"
Life=Complete 20/10 
"Its A Wonderful FPS Game,There Are No Pay-To-Win Mechanics In It,U Just Purchase Hats And Make Urself Look Cool,But Advised Not To Overspent"
"One of the greatest games ever created. I have invested countless hours and hundreds of dollars on this free game. I have paid 60$ for other games, half of which aren't even as near as fun as TF2. This game is a must for anyone new to PC gaming. Most of the community is very nice and the gameplay is hilarious."
"Since it's release, TF2 has always stayed strong. A very well made game Which is a war themed FPS with a amazing sence of humor. Plus, you can can customize your mersonaries, making it the 'War Themed Hat Simulator' since 2009."
A really fun game with many classes to choose! I very recommend this game!
"You don't need to be good at the game to enjoy it. Every class is unique and every game is different. You can easily spend hours in this game improving and having fun. It is very balanced and, for an 8 year old game, it is still updated frequently.  The best advice I can give you is to stay away from the in-game store (You can trade just 1 key for hundreds of weapons or loads of hats!), practice basic abilities like air-strafing, explosive jumping and airblasting, and to change what maps and classes you play to keep it fresh and stop yourself from getting bored or burnt out."
Hats. Sexy hats. why not play this game?
"If you want to be addicted to drugs, this is the 1st step. Do drugs kids^"
"After a decade long hiatus from any Team Fortress game, a year ago, I installed Team Fortress 2 on a whim. I'm glad I did. It was like coming home after a long trip. TF2 is without a doubt the best version of TF I've played and the best multiplayer experience I've ever had. It has more content than all its predecessors combined. It looks better. It plays better. It has more gamemodes, providing a large amount of variety. It's a damn good game and since it's Free to Play and can pretty much be run on a potato, there is no reason you shouldn't give it a try.  I rate it 5 bananas out of 5."
"I can run around and kill people with a fish, 11/10 BEST GAME EVER"
This game is alright i guess
"What I like about tf2 is the community. Although there are some rough talking peeps, MOST are welcoming and funny. One player actually gave me premium for free. you heard it right. FOR FREE. I almost cried. jk. But I liked that he gave me premium for nothing in return. 10/10 best community."
Worse than drugs.
I have ~15 hats and I don't care for any of them but no I'm not giving them to you
"If you have Steam and don't have this game, there is something desperately wrong with you While F2P games have given themselves a negative image with micro-transaction filled gameplay and Pay too Win content, TF2 makes anything you can only buy are purely cosmetic and uneffecting of the gameplay The only things that can change the gameplay are the weapons. Every weapon can be found randomly, or you can craft them out of other items free of charge. A fantastic thing about the weapons is that each and every single one of them have a noticable downside. Increased damage can come at the penalty of lower movement speed or health. This is repeated in the classes: The heavy is a big damage dealing, and absorbing, death machine, but he moves humiliatingly slow. The Sniper has the greatest ranged weapons in the game, capable of instantly killing any class, but powerful shots have to be charged and he snaps like a flipping twig But, I hear you say, what about MvM Mann up, a valuable weapon rewarding experience you have to pay to get into. I reply, not necessairily. Mann up tickets can be traded, along with their rewards (though those are much more valuable)"
"Definitely my all-time favorite game. It never gets old &amp; they are constantly adding to the game - keeping it fresh and interesting. It helped introduce me to some of the most amazing people I have ever met and some of my closest friends. There are so many different classes, weapons, accessories, maps, and game types that, even after several years of playing, I am still discovering new maps to explore, new game types to enjoy... The list goes on! I will always love this game &amp; the wonderful people that I've met through it. Thank you, Valve! ::gush::"
this is a Free To Win game :) Gangster
Most awesome multiplayer game in a while. always new strategies and mechaniics available to switch up the game
It has a few glitches but it is really fun all the classes i suggest biggeners watch youtube first    (Glitche's)  Teleporter in payload it will get you stuck in the cart I Would give 100 thumbs up  (Hack's)  AimBot   Wall Hacks (see players through walls)  1 Hit Kill Hack
"i Love This Game So Much! Thank you Valve Your an Awesome Game Maker! i Love those Hats and Those Weapons and Hats i Just Love This Game so Much Thanks And Also Thanks for the Taunts Your the Best Valve! I Also Love The Classes Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy All Classes are Pretty Dang Fun Good Job and Keep up the Good Work Valve i Can't Wait for the Next Update! Thank You!"
I loved thos game because every class has its own difficulty such as a heavy is pretty easy to use because of his minigun and is able to kill a target easier. I like how you progress you find new weapons. 10/10
"A very nice game, it would be nice if they put competitive. It deals a lot with him and get some nice updates."
"This game has chaned my life, i play it everyday, i have met so many people and friends, and there is never a dull moment. If you crave a difficult 1st person shooter, crazy jumps through the air, unblievable airshots, incredible trickstabs or joining the gibus gang there is something for you to do. For all of you new players i would like to say SAVE THE DWINDLING SPYCRAP POPULATION!!!"
its a awesome FPS game with classes go get eem boy

recomended for players who likes shooting games and cartoons
"I love this game, I recommend this game to everyone "

"If i could say one word that would describe tf2 it would be: OMG this game it awesome and i luv it, because im a rebel xD"
The most fun I have ever had playing online.
The best
This is the best game i have ever played!!!  VALVE did a great job here.
*In heavy voice* Da. Is good game.
As long as you know what your doing the game is good.
i would definatly recomend this game to any buyers
This game ruined my life. c: 11/10
"Team Fortress 2 is, dare I say, one of the most innovative FPS games of all time. With nine different classes to choose from and battle with other online users head on in different game modes, the combinations are endless. The graphics of this game are somewhat simple, but stylized in such a way that reminds me of a comic book, which is very appealing. Being able to customize your loadout and collect hats, miscs, taunts, etc. the possibilities are endless. The community is also a competitive group of people, all around the world going for the top of the scoreboard, or the community that strives to get that one certain hat, and have the richest backpack. Now, a few downsides would be some of the exploitable bugs, but that's not too big of a deal. Valve is very good with fixing the bugs found nowadays. The annoying downtimes from item servers can be an annoyance as well, but aside from those few things it is overshadowed by Team Fortress 2's greatness. With more being added frequently, the involvement with the community, and addicting gameplay, TF2 is given a solid 9.5/10"
A really good game i really recommend this this is the ultimate valve fps.
"This game is awsome.It has random weapon drops,crafting,cool classes and great gameplay."
3 reasons why you should play this game. 1. It's free 2. You can make good money from trading. 3. Pootis.
"Team Fortress 2, a game about teamwork and killing people. It is fun and has many different class and weapons to help make the game even more funner.   I approve this game"
Great and Addictive Game
"Tf2 is an extremely versatile FPS-shooter with 9 classes that all have completely unique and different functions that help the team.  I've spent about 1600 hours on it, and I don't regret it. There are so many ways to play tf: Either have fun in pubs and just mindlessly ♥♥♥♥ around with all the weapons and stuff there is to do, or play competitively, in 9v9 and 6v6 organised matches.  The best thing about tf2 is that it's completely free to play. Not just that, it's not even Pay2Win, you cannot buy better weapons or any other advantages with real money, the only thing that a Premium Upgrade gives you is the ability to trade with other players, and wear miscs, which won't give you any advantage in combat. This is something I respect the devs for."
Great game to play
"A good game with memorable characters and decent gameplay, but with a few issues like server lags(during mvm this is a real pain in the butt) and most of the time unbalanced teams ( I mean that if one or two advanced players join in one team and the other, may it be beginner or decent players are just going to get screwed by them and most of the time leave the server). Another thing, but that does not bug me that much, is that way too many players are at the age of ten or even lower( I think I met someone who told me he was six or seven). As I said, it`s not a big deal for me, but for many other (older) players who are just annoyed by them( for example because of mic spamming). But all in all, Team Fortress 2 is a fun game."
This is nice thing
"♥♥♥♥ing best game ever, 65% of my life right now! AND IT'S FREE!"
Nice game
"Absolutely love the game, addicted already."
If I could put this game in simple words for you I couldn't. There is nothing fun about this game and there is nothing I like about it. It simply just ruined my life. It all started when I visited a friend of my mom we went to her house and I saw her son was playing PS2 so I wanted to watch him his name was David and he was 24 when I walked in he locked me in his room and took his ♥♥♥♥ out it tasted like skin and M&amp;Ms. I HATED IT and guess what game was on his ps2 screen...  Yep he was playing Ratchet and Clank what a dik! ♥♥♥ him and TF2 I hate sex im allergic now. ♥♥♥♥ Hiphop
"I love how this game is different from all other war games and how much skill it takes to play this game, overall it's my favorite game I've ever played."
This game is very fun It has a good sense of teamwork. 9?10 IGN
really cool game 10/10
I have been playing this game for over a year now and I have LOVED it and it has become my main game for a while now. I have been slowly losing interest but recently I picked up competitive and that kept me in the game. HIGHLY recommend this game and I think MANY would agree with me. Thanks
I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes public fps (first person shooters). It requires team strategy and can be very fun. The are endless possibilities for loadouts and it is so diverse. This a great game that connect many people all over the world.
"Basically, Team Fortress 2 is a unique game, defying the laws of FPS games around the wolrd by looking at the FPS genreat a new perspective. Not only does the game provide you with useful tips and trick, it has been running for years and years, like a trian not going to stop until the END OF THE LINE UPDATE ;D Anyhow, if you play this game you will not regret it. Sure there are hags within the community but don't take their lame advice, take it from ME!  All in all, the game is imaginitive and has its own economy, what other game has that? So I rate this game hat out of eight, mate"
"Let's talk about one of my favorite games on Steam, TF2. I know it's kinda strange to review a game that is free, since pretty much anybody can play it, but I really want to share my thoughts on it, since I think it's awesome. Also, this is my first review on Steam, so please let me know what you think.  Let's talk about the graphics first. Usually, First Person Shooter games consist of realistic graphics with a military theme. All of these games look almost the same, with very minor differences, that you can barely tell them apart from each other. TF2 however, went for a very cartoonish artsytle, making it stand out from the crowd. The graphics are also over the top, with tons of explosions, blood and body parts flying all over the area, but at the same time it feels lighthearted because of the artsyle, adding to the humor of the game. To sum it up, the graphics are very unique and add to the charm of the game.  Next let's talk about the most important part of the game, the gameplay. For anyone who is a fan of singleplayer only games, you might be disappointed, since the game is online only (there is a practice mode where you can battle against bots, but they obviously feel very artificial). There's also no story, well sort of. All of the story of the game is told through comics that you can read on the TF2 website, but are not available in game. So yeah, this game is pure multiplayer, but that's not a bad thing at all. I am a person that usually tends to dislike FPS games where the focus of the game is multiplayer like Call of Duty, since it doesn't require too much skill in my opinion, only fast reactions which causes tons of rage. TF2 however , is different in that regard too. This game requires a TON of skill, and because of that it might be offputting for new players, but if you stick for a while, you will see how satisfying pulling off an awesome trick is. Also, unlike many FPS games where you can pretty much do everything on your own , in TF2 you HAVE to work as a team, after all, It's called Team Fortress, not Me Fortress. Trying to fight three enemies, or more at a time WILL NOT work for you AT ALL. Instead, you have to rely on your team, which also adds to the strategy of the game. Believe me, there's a lot of strategy in this game, a lot more than you might think, one of those being the classes which I will talk about right now. The classes are one of the things that really make this game unique. There are nine classes, each having their own stats and playstyle. The thing is, they are very well balanced. Each of the classes completely change the way that you play the game, so if you get bored of playing a certain class, no problem, because you can change into another class at any given time. I'm not going to talk about each one, but believe me, the things that each of the classes does well, they do the best, but each also has their lowpoints, which is why the classes are very well balanced. There are also many game modes, adding even more to the variety of the game. All of that was before the game became Free to Play, so what was added since then, and is it a Pay to Win kind of game? The answer: alot, and not at all, In fact, TF2 is one of the most complete F2P games I have ever played. So what do you get in advantage of being a paid player? Hats. Seriously, hats. Do they add you some sort of an extraordinary power that makes you completly overpowered, making it that nobody can beat you? No, just hats and other cosmetics that don't change a darn thing, other than making you look fancy. For most of the community, hats are some the most important things in TF2, leading to tons of trades and paying actual money in order to become the fanciest of them all. I personally don't really care for the hats, only about the gameplay, but many players enjoy that, so if trading's your thing, go ahead. Other than what I've said, what else you can buy with actual money? Weapons. The weapons however, can be found randomly by each player and a lot of these completely change your playstyle, adding even more to the variety. I really like the weapons system in the game, mostly because a lot of the times, you don't put yourself in an advantage for using them, heck, sometimes it's even better to use your stock weapons that each class starts with. So why use them? Simply because they are fun. They are also very well balanced (well, most of them...), so again, you don't put yourself too much in an advantage for using them. So, basically you really don't need to become a paid player in order to enjoy the game. The thing is, becoming a paid player is as cheap as you want it to be. You decide how much you want to pay in order to become a paid player, and that's pretty cool. Another thing, the game keeps being updated, despite being 7 years old, making it feel fresh.  Next, I'll talk in a brief about the game's charm. I've already talked about the graphics, but what other things make the game charming? Well, the characters. Besides playing differently, they all have their own personality and in game quotes. Some of the quotes are really funny, and the characters' personalities really shine in that regard. Also, TF2 has some of the most clever advertising I have ever seen:the 'Meet the...' videos, where the characters' personalities shine even more. I really recommend you watching them since they are awesome.   So these are all the positives, are there any negatives? Yes there are. First, the auto balancing in this game can become EXTREMLY annoying. At some points you will score many points for the team, almost close to a victory, to then be moved to the other team, resulting in a loss, which is obviously very frustrating. Next, there are many bugs and glitches, but that to be expected from a big game as this. And third... THE RANDOM CRITICAL HITS!!! I HATE THEM!!! Two other negatives that I have aren't really Valve's fault but I will say them anyways. First, the community can be extremly annoying at times. How? By making fun of Free to Play players. They think that just because they don't pay, it makes them bad at the game. That logic annoys me, since I've seen F2P players that are better than some that just like to brag about their hats, but if that does happen to you, just ignore them and enjoy the game. Second, is that because the game has been out for quite a while, there are many skilled players here, which can really frustrate newcomers, but as I've said before, stick for a while, and it will get much better.  In conclusion, I think TF2 is a fantastic game, possibly the best free game I've ever played. If you haven't already, please play it, it's free, so you have nothing to lose.  For those asking for a score, I'll give it somewhere between 9 and 9.5 out of ten. The reason for that score is that I think no game is perfect, but there many great games out there and this is one of them.  Highly recommended for everyone, even for those who dislike the genre, like me."
"Team Fortress 2 became my 2nd favorite game the day i got it. Part of it inspired my new but not yet published awesome anime, Army Game, which actually has Team Fortress 2 characters in it. I love this game just like i love this Doctor (Medic). If you want to know who my favorite character is, it's The Soldier. He's awesome, and funny."
awesome game everyone should play this game 
Its A Amazing Game
"This is a very nice fps, but its more about the hats and taunts. than about the killing! lol "
You hold a gun and shoot people.
This game is very well made with amazing graphics with characters that are uniqe and very fun to play.
THIS GAME IS TOTALLY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Good FPS game with a lot of diversity
Great game to play with friends or play casualy.
This is an amazing game!!!!!!!!
"What i learned from tf2, If you hit somthing with a wrench you actually fixing it. 10/10 would hit my computer again."
Great game 8/10 hard achivements also better than the original
How To Play TF2:  Step 1: Buy all cosmetics from Manco. Store. Step 2: Show off your cosmetics in servers. Step 3:Trade ypur cosmetics for unusual hat. Step 4:Play on servers even though yoou have no skills. Step 5:Thats All Have Fun!
tf2 is very fun game:D 
"The best game ever, its a right hoot!!!"
"Forget about the memes and hats, behind all that there is still a good shooter that you should give a try."
"It WAS a fun game.... before they stop caring. it is a fun game if you have a few buddies to run around and rockettjump, or just have a comp game (you need 10$ for that, 8 years of asking for competative and they make us pay for it, also its completly crap) I really really REALLY loved this game before hand, but they just half-♥♥♥ everything. all updates that happen (every 6+ months) is a crappy update that adds new hat, weapon skins, or reskins. rarly ever adding a new weapon. plus there will ALWAYS be another update fixing somthing they have been doing for so damned long. like this year with the 'merasmissions' (or contracts to some) they dont work, at all, they did an update to fix them, THEY STILL ARNT FIXED. im skipping over alot of stuff, im not saying this game is all that bad, its just dieing, the developer part, not the comunity. All im saying is, if you're expecting this game to add stuff afterwards that will enhance your gaming experience, good luck to you."
evem thoug i have an f2p account this game is so good since i have been trying to get everty weapon that i can get w/o using the mann. co store and also so far te collection is going great. 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10
good game and is full of f2p
This is the best free game to play.There is so many types of classes to choose from.Many maps gamemodes ect.If you like shooting games then you will like this.  I rate this a 9.7/10
"One of the best multiplayer games out there. You can never get bored from this game! There's lots of things to do! Such as: Rocket Jumping,Sticky Jumping,Market gardning,Reflect Dodge ball And lots more! I totaly recomend you trying this game and sticking to it."
"I use to love this game, it was probably the the only free game that I could run on my craptop well and enjoy so mutch that I put hours into it. But one day my inventory was deleted all the suddon and I don't quite know why but I kept playing spent well over 50 bucks on items and became pretty good at the game, but then there was meet your match, And it sucked I didn't fell like it was a good game anymore. It felt like it was trying to copy a game that was thought to copy tf2 when it really didn't. And so I stopped playing the game hoping for it to change eventually then about after a month my inventory for tf2 was almost completely wiped again with no notification or reason and wasn't even given any of that money I spent on the game back. Then just about 1 hour before I wrote this I played it again it felt broken, unfinished like it was a pre alpha. Tf2 was a great game but vavle destroyed it.#MakeTF2GreatAgain"
It is most certainly a game.
I hate this game.   It's unbalanced and filled with hackers. Along with the main focus on the game being cosmetics rather than gameplay. Why is the review postive? Valve doesn't care so why should I.  (Just kidding Valvo I'll keep playing no matter how much you hit me.)
 This time I'll write a proper review...
"Do you like playing a FPS that is different from your average shooter game? Do you like wacking your enemies with frying pans? Do you like having a game that has classes and each one being completely different? Even if the answer is 'No' to these questions, I ABSOLUTELY recommend this game to anyone who hasn't tried it.  Edit: Even after the overeaction of the community because of the MYM Update, I still absolutely recommend this game to ANYONE who hasn't tried this game, yet."
Well this game is probably my most played game of all time  besides nba2k apparently but the only problem i have is either the community heres an example a guy who only played 200 hours and has unusuals calls me a noob and i played over 1k hours  and people who bully the new players so well most just get over it but i guess some will quit playing tf2 cause of the community but otherwise tf2 is a good game
Lost my mind. +1.
how to play tf2   step 1 - when you hear a annoying kid talking to the mic make him rage or dominating him  step 2 - if your a admin and you hear a annoying kid again banned him in tf2 not kick not mute just banned step 3 - if you hear annoying thai kid then use ear ♥♥♥♥ mic spam or dominating him for raging step 4 - tell to the annoying kids and thai kids say ♥♥♥♥ YOU! step 5 - ENJOY THE GAME    (ALSO THIS GAME IS NOT FOR THAI KIDS AND AMERICAN KIDS AND SCRUBS THIS GAME IS ONLY FOR TEENAGERS OR ADULTS AND PROFFESIONAL AND NOT ANNOYING ONES ALSO THIS GAME IS BRUTAL AND WHY THEY PARENTS LET PLAYS THIS GAME? ENJOY THE GAME OF SCREAMING KIDS)
TF2 is a fun game new wepons ever achevment if u don't have this game buy is it's free to play PS whoever idea was it to make mann saxxy aword on 20 that was my B-day
"A very good game.  Many interesting gamemodes to play, if you get tired of one you can always play another. The game is very balanced, all of the 9 classes have their own strength and weaknesses and are unique in personality and design. And unlike other shooter games new weapons aren't better or worse than the stock weapons.  And lets not forget that you don't have to spend a single dollar if you don't want to.  It is a shame if you never tried it out."
It's k
Good Game Play It Or Ur DED!
This game will protect your virginity
is this rated t or m i need to know 
Best hat simulater EVER!
BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY LIVE I GIVE A 100/10
"A friend of mine has 1,000+ recorded hours on this game and I've watched her play the majority of those hours. So, of course, now I play it and I like the demo, because he is the most ethnically diverse character and also he is most powerful.  I give this game 5 buckets of popcorn out of 6."
"Ive got to buy these crates  Also, play awesomenauts because it gives this guy who calls himself TheScriptan a serious case of natural beef jerky, made from two ingredients; salt and beef"
I dont know why im even doing this because there are only about 6 of you who don't play this game. 10/10 
"Even in this day and age, Team Fortress 2 continues to be one of the most popular multiplayer games in this day and age despite its age. Although not all updates are great (End of the Line...) the updates are what make TF2 a beautiful on-going project by Valve which will continue to entertain us for many generations to come!"
"This game is freaking bloody amazing. Graphics are pretty damned good for an 07 game (Still look relatively new), and the pictures in the gallery of TF2 don't give it justice. Now that it is free to play, Just download it! Theres regular updates, and theres no way you can lose. Plus, You can get hats! Win win! WIN!"
this is a game when u pl... damned I cant find any words for THIS GAME this is great game but I cant tell how great it is graphics are not realistic but who cares its fun aaaaaaaaaaaaaaghhhh! I dunno wut to write here ok lets just do it like this -&gt; Just look how many hours of my life I wasted in this game and imagine what kind of game can make a guy play like dat many hours dat would help I gues         btw why u even read this play it already its free jesus!
"What can I say? Comedy, Violence, and Beating up robots. A good game indeed."
The best FPS of all times.
"It's free, you get free hats, weapons, more hats, taunts, another update with even more hats, NEW WEAPONS?!, wait for a new update, more hats, a map, more miscs and that is TF2 updates in a nutshell.  10/10 would play it for 800 hours again."
"Hm.. how would I put this into words and sentence.. I played this game last year and I've got a total of 1000 hours + The point of this game is.. well, collecting hats and ♥♥♥♥."
Best hat simulator ever.
"Team Fortress 2 is a great free to play, bloody, shoot em' up game with a cartoony style to it. One of the awesomest games i've ever played!"
Team Fortress 2 I think someone named the game incorrectly it shout be called Hat Fortress 2. For a free 2 play game its alot of fun and has alot of replay value so If your in the mood for murding people quickly with a heavy or take your time as a spy this game is fun as.Oh yeah don't spend over $20 on weapons its not worth it.
It's a good enough game if you have the cash to splash.
This... Game.... IS AWESOME!
"Trading simulator 2015.   Let's see. I've spent over 500 hours trading, only around 100 actually playing the game. Let's say something drops every hour. Let's say that'll be 490 weapons and 10 cosemetics. That's around 245 scrap+130 scrap=375 scrap, or 39.66 refined.  That is around 4 keys, at 10 refined per key (used to be 5 ref when I started). I've also spent a key to get premium. My backpack is worth 190 refined, or around 19 keys.  I've spent 6 keys on Total War Shogun 2, 4 keys on Fall of the Samurai DLC for the same game, 2 keys on Empire Total War and 2 keys on Deus Ex Human Revolution. In total that's 28 keys I've made (including the deduction of 4 keys from drops and 1 key to start with). You know how long it would take to make that under the minimum wage here in Straya?   10 hours at most."
"OMG THE BEST GAME I'VE PLAYED IN 13 YEARS!!! BTW, I'm 13 years old."
"Hats. Hats everywhere. So many Hats and other cosmetic items that it's pretty much impossible not to find a combination you like. Also, enough weapons to find a way of killing your opponents that suits you. 9 Classes, each with a unique set of weapons, a fairly realistic personality, and lots of cool hats to wear. So much extra content (Official comics, etc.) that lets you get an incredibly in-depth look at the game's story and the backstory of each Class.  Overall, I give TF2 a Hat/10 Best game ever, play it now."
It has fancy looking hats.  Do I need to say more?
pretty good  no bears tho
The game made of POOTIS
"Lost friends, time,family, Money, greads, and self respect.  10/10"
the most epic game EVER 
"♥♥♥♥ing great! One of the best, if not the best, online first person shooters i've ever played"
Best online Hat Simulator out there!
i tried it a bit it was ok but pretty bad
"Alright, there might be some people with some problems with my opinion. This game was good until updates just came by and stuffed TF2's er3ctum with hats. I mean, so far I've only seen hats then some more hats, but then maybe by a little chance. Some weapons. But also. Trading... it screwed my life over. I started with trading a bit later and it was fun. Til I actually got this massive drop from MvM and got scammed by someone. So I started with the real serious trading. I traded for a year to get one single worthless unusual and people trying to scam me all of the time and if I didn't accept someone offer they kept calling me for a scammer/sharker. In my opinion is... this game was a good game once, but it isn't anymore. I'm leaving this game forever, it have wasted so much of my life that there isn't a single chance that I will jump back into the hole of darkness. My last words will be.... SO LONG SUCKERS!!! BAHAHAHA. Not seriously. Bye."
Now this is a great free to play game I highly recomend it
"Man were to begin with tf2. It's a game i have played for 3 years and i definitely think this game has not lost it's touch. Everone has said tf2 is dying ever since meet your match. But i have been through it since love and war and it's not dying not one bit. This game has the most unique set of chacters each with a personatly i have come to love and each time i played as each class i enjoyed it. Each had given me an oppertunity to try a new way to help my team and i had never felt usless. And with its vast weapon choice i never got bored. Customization definitely had also made the game gret with all its taunts, cosmetics, and weapons/skins. Each makes your character diffrent from all the rest and i do enjoy it. Its really ironic since tf2 is know as the hat simulator game since it's know for that. But the biggest thing you should get tf2 is the community. I have never seen a community this big. Really it shows if you don't want to play the main gamemodes the community has other things to enjoy. dogeball, deathrun, x10, randomizer, saxton hale, prophunt , etc these are fun to spend time on just for fun and it does create great moments. Trading has a big economy behind it which i have never seen in a video game before and which is very fun to do. It makes you meet people and get new items with out spending a dime which i do recommend if you want to try. But wrapping this up get tf2 if you do you won't regret it but i do recommend put at least 5 dollars into it you do get a better experince with it. But even if you don't you will love tf2 and maybe you will get memories from it. And in the end tf2 will always be one of my most played games that i enjoy"
Dope as ♥♥♥♥
i love this game it have so many classes i like  
"Team Fortress 2 is my favoite game because i like to kill people and win, this game is also part of the orange box which have hl2 in it and hl2 is my favoite game to play because its like gmod and i like gmod."
Woweee what a game! If you like running around shooting 12 year olds and 32 year old men with classic weapons then this is the game for you. Graphics are a bit cartoony but my grandson loves it so it cant be that bad. It's free so why not? Am I right?
This is only fun if you have no brain so it's good for everyone on Steam.
"While MYM definently killed a few aspects of TF2, It is still the same gameplay that it was before. The new quickplay system is very different from pubs, but you can still market garden. You can still choose maps and gamemodes. You can still waste money on hats, and you can still watch F2Ps do what they do best. Overall MYM was realy overreacted to. I still find this a great game to dump time into. Competetive mode is different, but I really don't care about that, so yeah. Good game 10/10"
I like how it is a game of progress and The best multiplayer game I have played right now.
"The best free 2 play game title that i have spent years playing, it's the best game ever, great job Valve!!!"
"This game has everything: funny physics,lots of content,endless fun,a lot of funny moments, and most importantly hats and taunts!"
"I still RECOMMEND this game because I think it has hope, but this review is going to be negative. I've played this game for about a year and it has become one of my favorites, but the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ meet your match update (that tried to make the game's server system work more like overwatch) brought the whole game to hell. Valve, please bring back the pubs! Stop trying to make the game like overwatch but worse. This is TF2 not OVERWATCH. IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT GAME! Now you HAVE to queue for over 10 minutes to just join a stupid match that is probably halfway through already and cant change teams even if you have like 5 people afk. Overwatch also works this way but sends you into a skirmish server(waiting server with no objective) if you wait for more than 1 min. Why wasn't that copied? I thought they mimicked everything from rating the match good or bad to the team victory shot at the end of the round. That would've been actually fine. How about when you level up in OW, you get a free loot crate that is free to open. Why wasnt THAT copied? The so called 'keyless crates' valve added are a trick because they cost just as much as keys and require the same amount of money to open. I guess valve just threw together a jumble of overwatch content just to make themselves look cooler and attract attention(but failed). This update has only decreased the amount of players playing(normally around 70,000, now only like 30,000). Many youtubers are uploading less and less content about this game too, which makes me sad. This update may as well made a lot of people to want to play overwatch(including me) . The only people that benefit from this update are those minority 5% who play competitive who somehow think the new system is easier and more 'fair'. Now valve, BE YOURSELF! This game is one of the most unique fps I've ever played(you never see hats, dancing, or sandvich parties in other games do you?). Don't let what other games make affect what you do! You still have an opportunity to bring everyone back if you JUST BRING BACK QUICKPLAY in a future update. It's simple, you can keep the competitive stuff, but just add valve servers back into the server search box."
"Aight I never do reviews, mostly cuz i dont care, but I do care for this mess. I wanted to play with my friend so i downloaded this again. I seen some other reviews people sayin they fixed problems, but they didn't. Aimbot still a thing and you can't simply ignore them cuz if you leave the game you're put on a longer queue. It feels like you're punished for not dealin with their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t."
Hands down the best war themed hat simulator of 2016
"Pros - - Lots of different game modes for instance dodgeball, saxton hale, payload, capture the flag, king of the hill, jail break, prop hunt, even surfing (cs players will know this) and many many more. Even soccor is now a type of game mode. - Free (No need to pay money to play. Bad for people who already brought the game =/.) - Lots of different weapons and cosmetic items  Cons - - Free (Some say being free made the game worst for instance people more hackers, ads when you join a server and lots of players who don't know how to play.) - Some of the weapons you find are just reskins with the same stats (An example of this would be the pyro's melee weapons.) - Trading is expensive if you don't waste money on buying items  This is just a quick review listing some positives and negatives. I do love the game, The different game modes makes this game have a lot of replay value compared to other shooter games and you can even make your own plugins for your server so practically the limit is your imagination for new game modes :)."
This is best game 4ever :D
I'm not even sure if i should really recommend it.  IT WILL CONSUME YOURE LIFE!  I could've cured cancer by now!
"Addictive. If you don't want to work at McDonald's in the near future, don't play this."
I don't have a life anymore. Nice game.
"Best f2p game ever, sadly updates are so dumb sometimes :/"
Amazing game c: Really love it.
"Now this game is one of the best free to play game, But... its dying, How ? thanks to Valve for not caring about this game  i don't know what to say now, Congrats to Valve for not making the right class and weapon balances and letting the hackers to ruin your game thanks Valve im not even mad anymore i gave up on you Valve just keep selling your cs:go skins you're the best. so guys as you can see Valve doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about Team Fortress 2 anymore because they have better way to earn money. how do we fix it ? Well we can't"
"After playing for roughly four years, I am comfortable in saying that this game is one of those games you enjoy splurging on during the weekends when you've got the free time. The environments, the dynamic (albeit boarderline insane) characters, the various weapons and cosmetics, it's all just wonderful!"
"A wonderfull game. Beautiful graphics, a variety of choices of maps, and a perfict economy for regular players."
Very addictive   Very funny  Very cool  Lots of maps   Lots of hats and misc   Lots of gamemods  Great bright colorfull design graphics   One of the greatest shooters ever   U need to work and sinchronize with your team   IT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THAT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T NAMED COD WHERE U SHOT EVERITHING THAT MOVES !  I just love it.....  And it is freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeetooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooplayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
all the blowing up lel
I would recommend this game to everyone who doesnt have money to buy other games and i love it when i find new items and have funny moments and i dont have anything bad to say
sunlight please ! 
"So yeah, uh...  Hats Weapons Unusuals Servers Good AND/OR bad updates (depending on the opinion of EVERYONE) Weird Youtubers out there playing this game forever And...                                       MEEEEEDIIIIIIICS !!"
"Team Fortress 2 was my first game on Steam, and it never ceases to fail to put a smile on my face while playing it. In it, you can find your casual FPS game in a more cartoonish style, but as you go later on, you develop a hat collection and find all the custom servers, not just limited to Payload, but it also includes the new gamemode, Mannpower, and 2 well known customs, Freak Fortress 2, where you fight against the 'hale' which can be any sort of boss from anything, and Jailbreak, where you must attempt to break out of jail, get ammunition, as you dont have guns when you start in jail, and kill the guards and the warden. I would reccomend this for anyone looking to get a fresh start in the community. Chrysalis out!"
A great game that will make you spend all of your money on cosmetics. I spent most of my money on hats... So I'm pretty addicted to this game.
"I don't have anything to say that the other thousands of negative reviews don't, but hopefully my 1000+ hours will emphasize just how ♥♥♥♥ed this game has become."
"Best free to play game out there. Constantly updated with new items, and you can play as long as you want without paying."
&gt;installed &gt;Get Headshot by guy with 3 unusuals &gt;want unusuals &gt;spend $500 on items &gt;go broke &gt;die  10/10 would die again
"I have above 2000 hours played, yet I'm still playing it and making mods for it. Do I need to say more?"
Valve ruined the casual gamemode of this game which was one of the main reasons many players played the game. Great job valve keep up the horrible updates to make overwatch win.
it was fun
Best...Free to Play Game on Steam.
Wonderful and Fun Game would Recommend
pretty good game but also they should make it so you also get mayflower keys as well as cases
"I think,this game...BEST!!! "
Best Game All about Hat Simulator and Pure Skill required for this kind of hard RPG.
Its ok
Great Game
"I can't stop. I've sunk a good bit of money into this, but it is just so ♥♥♥♥ing fun."
its a comic like first person shooter and i reccomend it to everyone it has a very different playing style with the different classes and game modes your better off being an all rounder than a great sniper or heavy. love it and highly reccomend.
"This game has to be one of my favourites, as much as I did play CoD first, i definately perfer this game, its classes are well thought up and are unique, it definately has some unique gameplay and dialogue. I find this game very addictive, and I mostly play this for hours on end"
"Definetly the wierdest, silliest, least sensical game I have ever played... But definetly my favorite!"
TEAM FORTRESS 2 IS GREAT GAME
Goes to Steam Store. Goes to free games. Sees Dirty Bomb. Downloads Dirty Bomb. Plays Dirty Bomb. For 6 hours straight. Gets a tad bit bored. Goes back to TF2. Forgets how to TF2 after playing Dirty Bomb. Gets rekt. A lot. And some more. Almost done. Remembers how to TF2. Also remembers how swaggy my character looks. Begins dominating half of enemy team. Wins.   10/10 would momentarily forget how different TF2 is from other FPS games and get rekt again. Praise Gaben.
"This game is banterous. now i can kill people while wearing hats and dancing. Banter, mate."
Gits boring if u 2 gud ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"It is a very good game there are endless ways to play, many weaponds you can get, and no limits."
  I played a little bit. Seems like a great game!
this game is awsome and u will luv cos u will want to have babies with this epic game
"you may think its too late in the life of tf2 to download this but think again!  ive been playing tf2 for 3 years now and i can tell you its really fun great variety of playstyles, competitive and ♥♥♥♥ for cheeky casuals and so much more. be warned though you will have to put money into this game to get the full experience but it unlocks trading and cosmetic creation so you dont even need to buy stuff. this game has a slow start but as you get items and add some funds you will find the fun among the chaotic, psycotic, colourful world of tf2.  P.S : ♥♥♥♥ you Overwatch and especially you MattPatt i didnt expect you to fall so low."
"All right I'm going to go full rant mode on this review...  First off, the community sucks and is nothing but a bunch of people who are way too try hard and I can never get more than 10 feet before getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t killed out of nowhere. Not only that, but it's usually a bunch of little kids of grown men who think their soooo good by killing opponents just leaving spawn. Secondly, it has become nothing but 1 big cash grab by Valve with cosmetics that are way too overpriced($13 for a ♥♥♥♥ing sombrero) and I honestly hate it. This game used to be sooooooo much better, but the latest update screwed it over as it takes 20 minutes for me to just get into a simple server(Although my Internet sucks) and the whole leveling up system is just plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. TF2 wasn't about leveling up and being the best ranked, it was about having fun with people and playing a genuinely good game. Valve, if your reading this, then you guys have made a HUGE mistake and I want a full refund for everything I've bought in this game. I still don't understand why companies do this to a devoted community who loves games like this, but al the developers think about is how to make a profit off of us. If you read this whole review, then thanks for taking time to listen to me and if you still like this game I can't stop you from doing so, but just respect my opinion and don't be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Thank you."
Get this game
".... Wow... Where to start  Dissapointment  I saw there was a new update, and I was excited. After it installed, I found that they had completely changed the UI, and added a bunch of stuff... Not so bad right?  WRONG  Along with a plentiful amount of bugs, The new update got rid of the great Valve servers, and replaced them with 'Casual Mode.' In Valve servers, you could choose your map and game type, but now, with the hot garbage that is Casual Mode, you choose your play type, wait 5-10 minutes to get into a server where one side is absolutely destroying the other, and the game ends up taking less time than you waited in your que. Also, I'm not sure if it is just me, but the game is unbearably slow. It ran perfectly before the update, but now it can barely get 10 fps.  Pretty Much: This game has gone down the hole, I would ask for a refund but I have played more than two hours... Anyone thinking about buying it should wait until they fix the mess they've made."
"Once you download this game you think its so overated, but once you give it them hours of game time it becomes a lot better and is quite addictive and its free... so if you dont like it it doesnt matter"
I love playing this game with my friends and receiving new weapons every day when I can! Keep it up valve and add more fun weapons and taunts.
Best Free To Play Game Of All Times.
My most favorite game of all time.
"I love this game! Team Fortress 2 is a team-based first-person shooter multiplayer video game. 1. It's free. 2. Each class has strengths and weaknesses, and must work with other classes to be efficient, encouraging strategy and teamwork. 3. There are more than 3 game modes. 4. You can play It with your friends. 5. In Team Fortress 2, each class has roughly three ways of attacking. 6. In Team Fortress 2, players join one of two teams comprising nine character classes, battling in a variety of game modes 7. Team Fortress 2 features nine playable classes, categorized into offense, defense, and support roles 8. Valve's continual tinkering has led to classes that can play multiple roles. 9. Love the design and looks of the game. 10. Many of the items offer nothing more than a playful twist on the game's already cheeky cartoon aesthetic."
"This game is a really nice game, and I think you should buy it.   JK I only made this review to promote our company's new snack, Peritos! Ready to eat, and never goes bad, going bad is for skrubs You can buy it for the low, low price of 42.69!"
This game is awsome :D
It is so fun
The best game ever. Even if you rage its still fun just to try to kill your foes. Evenly balanced classes that are fun to play. Its free get it now its worth it.
"Team Fortress 2 is one of my favourite games. 9 different classes each with hundreds of weapons, cosmetics and play styles. As well as having a useful and friendly community and market. It is one of my favourite games and i can always enjoy myself while playing. It is a fun and exiting game with lots of different gamemodes and maps (both professionally and community made), it sees constant updates and patches. There are always new weapons, cosmetics and maps being made. Everytime i have got bored of this game a new update or patch comes out and there are loads of new things to play with. There are some bad things about it though... people in game (like in any game) can be agressive and rude as well as offensive. Some of the updates are unbalanced and take a while to get fixed properly (like the most recent update, tough break, and the phlogistinator, fix it valve) allthough they do get fixed after a while and few hundred complaints. In conclusion i would say this is a great game and well worth downlaoding, especially as it's free!"
"Simply the best (from my perspective) multiplayer FPS experience on PC from 2007 till this day.  A lot of mechanics that require skill and mastering, events, original setting, great design, big and quite active community, memes, updates, Gmod videos, and much much more. You can play it, you can trade items, you can just screw around and past time, you can play it competitively, you can troll people, explore game mechanics...  It sounds like MMO, doesn't it?"
"If you like stabbing people in the back, collecting heads, collecting hats, conga lines, blowing people up, THIS OUTLANDISH  FPS GAME IS FOR YOU!! Collect, craft, and trade items to get the best loadout for each of the nine classes. Rocket or sticky jump your way out of danger, place unstoppable sentrys, freeze people solid, MUCH MUCH MORE! I rate this game... TEN OUT OF 5 STARS!!  The first part is slightly outdated. Don't get me wrong, I still like Team Fortress 2 a lot. Just not as much.  The reason I liked it so much is because it had a different... Feel, than any other valve game.  Not like Counter Strike, Not like Half-life, I can't really compare it to portal because that's in it's own little world. Anyways, through the updates that brought people so much happiness, A piece to a puzzle was being layed down. The 'Meat Your Match' update finished the puzzle. Stat Traks, Skins, Casual, Competitive; Suddenly, Team Fortress 2 became... Just like the others.  It's slowly turning into CS:GO  Half-Life 3 confirmed  Portal 666 confirmed       Don't believe me? GET NOSCOPED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"  Amazing First Person Shooter, (Although it is really a Hat Simulator :) ) Love the game, keep up the great work Valve, I love the maps, the classes, the items, the hats, the types of items and hats: Stock (Grey), Unique (Yellow), Vintage (Blue), Genuine (Dark Green), Strange (Orange), Unusual (Purple), Haunted (Very Light Green), Collector's (Red), Decorated (White), Community/ Self-Made (Green), Valve (Magenta), (Color Name) are the name colors of the weapon, and for a now F2P Game (Which I've spent probs +£100 on :D) it's pretty damn good! So yeah, that was my review.... Uh... You should really get this game even though it takes some time to install (Not too long)"
"My favorite game of all time. As much as I love Overwatch, I just can't get the same kick I get out of this game, I joined Steam for this game, and the memories made in this game are unforgettable. It's free to play, got a great lore, fantastic characters, and an uncountable amount of items. Best 5 years of my life so far, needless to say, I recommend it."
The best game ever made! And it's also free
"Yeah, it's ok. I mean not many people play it so... yeah. It's not a big deal."
"Oh Mann, what is there not to like about this game? Where should I start...  First of all, this game is so hilarious it will have you laughing your underwear off for weeks. Also, they don't tell you to play a certain way, instead they let you experience it for yourself! Team Fortress 2 seems to be perfected already! There aren't even any noticable bugs or glitches in this game. The customization and variety in this game is near infinite! 9 classes, hundreds of items, and of course, that Ghostly Gibus hat you got from dominating someone. This game is endless fun for all! You should definitely try it out if you don't already know its awesomeness! Get this game!!!  *10 bazillion thumbs up*"
great game i put over 400 hours into this game well done valve well done
Russians every where
"Can only be played for a few hours, after that it becomes boring."
   It's still popular after almost a decade!

Pretty good i guess
Telling kids to unbined all in the console has never been more fun on an fps.  
"Where angry teenage boys (and childish adults) can kick you out simply by being a main heavy as they can't take it when they get constantly killed.  Other than that? Yeah, it's a good game."
"  Well, TF2 is the best game I have ever play for sure.However, since the overwatch`s beta started, somethings change.Of course TF2 still my favourite game and I dun`t think that overwatch is able to replace it in the future,but the problem is-------I think Valve should pay more attention on this game. The recent updates or just adding skin/cosmetic in. I feel good to have skins and more cosmetic in the game,but serously, Valve, it`s time for you to give a real update for this game.Like the new mission in mvm, new maps or even new game mod.You can know that even most of the experenced players won`t leave tf2 and go to paly overwatch,those young player will.Overwatch is still a new born baby,lots of balance and element are still need to be improve and change.However, just like what I said.It`s a new born baby, that means it still going to have lots of updates to fell it to make it become a better game.If TF2 still keep adding skins or cosmetic only,this game will lost lots of new players in the feature. Plz valve, make this game better, it can and it deserve to be better. Don`t let it die slowly."
  The BEST hat simulator in history! Wait a second...... 
  Awesome F2P game.               P.S. Give me your unusuals.
This game is luck no skill. If you have a hat its even more luck than skill.    I recommend this game to anyone that loves to ♥♥♥♥ off children in this game

"Play this fun (money sucking) and action packed (time waster) watch as when an get a notifacation thinking that you got a new item but you just got your'e 300th crate then ponder why you spent 30$ on virtual hats your team will be the most strategic like going all sniper,all pyro,5 spies and 2 heavys,or all scouts try exicting new strageties like w+m1ing or being a pocket medic "

"Buy hats and get all the street cred, Oh and sometimes shoot people"
i PRAISE this game and i think everyone should play this war themed hat simulator!
Too MLG first game on steam i have had
It's an amazing free to play multiplayer game. Play it. :D
cool game get it now
playing this game is like sex   during which you contracted an STD that forces you to waste your money on overpriced hats    10/10 would get diseased and waste money again
Where people who like to wear fedoras still get ♥♥♥♥ on because they aren't unusual
"Really good game ! It looks like a cartoon ,but it's really interesting and fun to play in!"
"This game is so fun damn fun. Specially Deathrun, CTF, CP, PL, etc."
"I killed a fat Russian man with a stick of ice and threw a cigarette on his corpse, meanwhile I killed an drunken black Scotsman and myself via grenade uppercut."
Had a longer review. Decided to replace it with a shorter and more appropriate review:   That's TF2 
I like this dress-up game. It even has a multiplayer FPS mode on the side.
"What can I say that already has not been said?  -The characters are to die for... literally!  -The maps can be really cool at times, whether they're from Valve or a community map maker!  -The weapons are awesome, unique, and sometimes OP all at once!  -The community is strong with is game, young ones!  -It's free, bruh!  -Hats! Cosmetics! Shoes! Ducks! Magic books! Tokens! Oh boy!  This game is a must for first-time Steam users, so get going and install this game!"
It's not very good.

Great game to fool around with your friends in. Can also be very competitive if you allow it to be. Great game 10/10 Would recommend. 8/8 I r8 gr8 m8
"A game with action packed gameplay,wonderful artwork and the reason I have a steam account and working on a upcoming YouTube account makes tf2 the best game ever. When I was still called Wheatley care and was addicted to another game,called portal,I never played tf2 that much. I just downloaded it cause it was free and only played it once. After getting so bored of portal and giving up on the mods, I returned to the yet unfirmallar. World of tf2 and it was the best choice I ever made. Why? Because of fedoras,scouts,and pans. 'nuff said."
"'Oh, it's that silly hat trading game!'"
"TF2 is a very unique and interesting game. instead of you going around shooting and killing everything like in most other FPS.   Most people who like realistic games have probably already chosen not play this game just from the cover. There is quite of a variety of different things to do, OTHER THAN KILLING, yes, i just said it, other things to do in an FPS, what!?. Yes. TF2 has heaps of other things to do than battling another team to achieve your objective. Tradings hats im the midst of battle, also dancing, playing music, high-fiving giving people sandviches and messing around.   As you can hear from what I have said so far, you've probably realised TF2 isnt realistic at all, thats what gives it character. Talking about character, nothing gives this game character more than all 9 of the mercinaries, an over the top steriotypical australian sniper that throws ♥♥♥♥ at people, a crazy maniac wearing a fire suit that burns everything and a lazy texan guy who sits there drinking beer while his machines do all the work. I would say the characters are almost half of the game.   One of the main things to do in TF2 is trading, in TF2, it isnt who has the best gun, its who has the best lookings hats. Hats, you may wonder. Well hats are thrown at you within the first few minutes of playing, and the quest to get the most expensive items and coolest hats begins.  TF2 has been going strong since it first came out in 9TH OCTOBER 2007! YES, 8 YEARS! and still TF2 is now FREE TO PLAY! so it still gets heaps of new players every day, there are many people still supporting and helping the community grow.  TF2 is one of the best games on steam and one of Valve's most prized posessions, i can say it is a very well created game and deserves a 10/10. Its not like any other FPS and is probably quite different to what you first thought it would be.  I really recommend this game to anyone looking for funny and community driven games."
there's free to play games and then there are FREE to play games  then there's HATZ
"It's very good, made me kill my whole family"
Best Game 10/10   Gives you Extra Swag

The best F2P game.
this game is awesome
"Honestly one of the best games I've ever played. It's so much fun, even by yourself, but especially with a few friends who join up and mess around with you. The community is mostly friendly, aside from a few sticks in the mud. And the game is pretty balanced.   aside from pyros  "
"I would highly reccomend buying this game, most people are turned off due to its high price of $100 (canadian currency), but I can assure you that after completing this game, you will master the ability to carve a pumpkin with precise and quick movements using your wrist. Now I know there will be many that are skeptical after trying other products and coming up empty handed in the field of carving pumpkins, but those other products/other means of education are inferior compared to the strategies within this game that is taught thoroughly without this indie title. They have many different methods used to cover many grounds of different speeds of learning. They will allow you to master the old, and learn the new. The learning exercises are not 'one for all' method, or style, they give quite a wide variety to better suit what you want to learn and what you want to be capable of, which I find very good for my mix-match of strengths and weaknesses in specific fields.   Now you may be asking yourself: 'But what else is there to learn other than the basics? How would I be able to get back into this type of craft, if Ive been out of the game for so long?' Well, the art of pumpkin carving is quite simple to get the hang of, inexperienced, or a life time carver. You just have to ease youself back into it. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TL:DR This game saved me from cutting.  "
This game is awesome whether your a hardcore PC gamer or just a casual one. Easily played for hours.
A good shooter game with 9 classes . You need to choose wisely your weapons to find the best loadout. The only problem is hackers. There isn't that many but they are annoying. Randoms crits are fair and balanced. The surname of this game is HAT FORTRESS 2 . Personnaly I doesn't understand why people are upset with the skins and CS:GO.
"Team Fortress 2, were the community judge your skill by the amount of hats you have."
"Wallet ♥♥♥♥ Simulator 2007 (also known as Team Fortress 2) is the best Wallet ♥♥♥♥ simulator. In fact, I like it so much, that I live in a car with a laptop plugged into a street light outlet and use McDonald's free wifi to play this because my wallet got so physically and mentally sucked out of its money that it was blown off the face of the whole universe as we know it. Im so fundamentally wallet sucked that I only have one strange. I'm so broke because I spent all my money at the Mann Co Store before learning about Scrap.tf or any scrap metal. I'm so broke that the McDonalds manager comes outside and yells at me as I lock my doors and tell her to shut the ♥♥♥♥ up, but she can't call the police because she has no ♥♥♥♥ing brain as it got deep fried in the frier second day on the job all the way back in 2008, and Mrs. Manager Lady, if you're reading this, leave me alone when I eat the fries on the sidewalk or look through the trash for unfinished diet coke. Tf2 is one of the best games I ever played, and if you hate it come down to McDonalds and I'll beat you and Mrs. Manager Lady up, you Gibus engie."

"A stupid idiot clone and his other idiotic clone comrades try to steal briefcases from another group of clones of extra chromosomes. The briefcases reveal more information on how they were created and both groups want them; in fact, they are so dented in the noggin that they would even die for it. So they battle it out, and even drop a few documents due to the janky way they all run. The stupid idiot and his team steal all of the other team’s briefcases only to find out that the other clan of cloned idiots has other bases with even more briefcases. Then you realize that you are the stupid idiot, and you are playing in the basement, eating snack cakes and running about with fruity guns."
Its really fun to play and it has literally changed my life
This game is awsome :P lolz pretty sure your alrady know i cant even spell o-o

"WELCOME TO TEAM FORTRESS 2!  This is the game where you can be the best by wearing hats! Even better if your hat is burning or shining!

Everyone will respect you !  You can aslo spend your well-earned money on keys , which can be used to unbox crates . If you are sad , they will make you angry too!

It's free... seriously though it's probably my favorite game of all time.
It doesn't matter how many hours you play It doesn't matter how many hats you have It doesn't matter how many kills you have on your stranges It doesn't matter how good you are...  You can always die to a random 10fps m1 + w pyro... He doesn't even know what he did...   I cri every time
I got banned 500+ days ago for leaving cheat engine open after modding Borderlands 2. This was a secondary account at the time anyway.  11/10 would take Gaben's hammer into my ♥♥♥♥ again.

"I like how good it is, still enjoying with a bad PC. Great way to earn money, I earned literally $1."
"Explosions everywhere, flying gibs, original class mechanics, cartoony graphics, funny voice acting &amp; HIGHLY customizable. What could you want more? 10/10"
"So doing another review, because there aren't enough of those...  Anyway, this game. Perfect. Amazing. No flaws!   Haha, just kidding. The game is amazing, but there are various flaws in the game. *cough* W+M1 Pyros *cough*  But yeah, good game. And it's free, so that a plus in my book"
"Valve's famed war-themed hat simulator delivers on every level with fast-paced gameplay (except on 2Fort,) major weapon variety, balanced stats (excluding an infamous flamethrower and a thoughtless Scout gun used solely for the stupidly high knockback,) and an incredible level of character for its classes instead of overused lines and cliche weaponry. Team Fortress 2 is both a work of art and a labor of love."
"Do you like fun well.... that is how every review is started so I'm going to start with a disclaimer I am a CSGO player and have no idea what a first person shooter really is. If it was an opinion from a critic a playabe cutscene. This game isn't (cough cough, meet the series, cough cough)  In all seriousness though this is a great game mainly because it isn't made by EA and/or Ubisoft come on i get to play as a homosexual pyromaniac. That is what GTA is missing so for TF3 (never going to happen because gaben is in star wars and is never returning) can we have a female character. But i don't want a girl that every 12 year old boy is going to see and shout 'Boobies is big and tasty.' We want a sophistacated women who can kill a guy with her shooting not a girl who will smile to the camera and make a sexual sigh to make the little boy who is playing the game feel special, while all the other boys are getting that too. I don't want to frighten the elephant in the room , the elephant being new games and the room being you the customer, new games are better. Technollogy is growing and where is it growing to? The words from the magical medic..... 'I have no idea.' We need something new is the general point but what? Mabye just a bigger game that vwe can start again with but we don't want a star wars battlefront(2015). Overall a great game mabye we need a TF:GO"
This game will change your life
Im doing this for a game badge  10/10
"Play as ⑨ different classes and win in diffrent kinds of gamemode! After 400 hours of TF2 I really want to share this great game which is FREE! If u want to spend money on it,u could get a number of cool hats or something cool(maybe it only looks cool).If u dont it DOESNT matter.u can still have great fun.not like other fps games.it not very competive.u dont have to make urself too nervous to play.just feel free to shooting rockets...throwing flames...stab people....not violent right lol . while playing TF2,u can do whatever u want to. its not that similar to a real battlefeild.so it can be exciting and also can be so amusing.i really like TF2.i hope u can enjoy this great game too"
Team Fortress 2 is very funny game...
Very good and long work they done for this game congratulation valve and please relese half-life 3
1. Go on a class war server  2. Do the mannrobics taunt near the end because we were getting rekt  3. Get yelled at by a Gibus admin for not trying and having fun 4. Get banned   10/10 would team again
"I spent all of my money on this game, and it was more than worth it. 10/10"
this game is cool 
"Fun Game, had a small problem creating a server with and without a password, other than that great game"
its nice 
Just play and you maybe have some fun playing it
Too many hats and the golden gun I got recently didn't do anything different from the normal gun. what a load of ♥♥♥♥ 10/10.5 I'm making a ♥♥♥♥ reviews at 1 AM and I have college in the morning.
"there goes my grades, future, and college tuition"
"Hats... Hats never changes... :-D Good shooter, spent most time among Steam games, but at one point just stopped because got bored... Sold all items and bought GTAV then. Still i recommend this game - 'Most fun you can have online' (c)"
tf2 is very bad game dont play dis ♥♥♥♥ m8 everyone hax go buy toaster idiots ez just go play habbo best game eva
"This good game, I like this game."
it has hats
Its a great game. I hope to see in the future more great updates for this game as its developing.
Yeah it's pretty good I guess.
This game have hats BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!
This game becomes your life. Play it and sell your soul.
"This...is...the best...game...I've ever... played. Team Fortress 2 is an fps with a range of classes being the Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy. This game is not comparible to C.O.D because of it's cartoonish fashion and it's giant range of hats and weapons. Also, to all C.O.D players who haven't played TF2 before, LEARN ABOUT THE F*CKING SHIELDS!!!!!!!!!!!"
"this game is creative with rocket jumps,stickyjumps,and more YOU SHOULD PLAY IT"
I enjoy the team work.
WHERE ELSE WOULD ALL MY MONEY GO? A LIFE WITHOUT MY 'Cool Dude Cap' IS A LIFE I CANNOT TAKE PART IN!
"my day 1. was reking 2. woke up 3.was a pyro 4. made friends 5. was really good but it went in 1,3,4,5,2."
To anyone considering giving this game a go. They dont call it TEAM fortress 2 for nothing. You play without a team and you wont last for much longer. Great to play with friends and great to make new ones even. Some broken classes here and there but this game will always remain a remembered favorite. All 9 classes have became superstars in a way.  
"I like lemons, but you don't find them in Team Fortress, instead you find fun, humoristic, fast, action-packed and entertaning hours of gameplay. And you can't stop... It's so hard to stop that you can't notice the lack of lemons!"
"This Game Ranges From Scrub Players, To MLG Mofo's. For a free game some people spend hundreds of dollars on it, but you can be the bestest of the best even without spenidng no money so you can have mo money. Get Game- Get Good- Get Bestest- Get Gaem."
"HATS HATS AND MORE HATS!  This game is amazing to the point where it sucks your mind and cash into it. For a cause. Some of it might go to map makers. Some of it might go to a charity. It all depends on what you buy. This game has promo items for almost every popular game. It is one of the best fps games on steam alongside Rainbow Six Siege, CS:GO, and the modern warfare cod series. The amazing cosmetics you can equip will never end as long as you vote in workshop and have enough keys and ref to buy em. The class-making system functions well, as long as steam isn't undergoing maitenence (In which case you can't equip or change anything). You can go from a shotgun pistol to a wooden wrench to a freakin' rocket launcher that shoots lasers to a minigun. Honestly, I have had the most fun on steam in this game because of the taunts I have and a custom gamemode: Pyro Dodgeball. Basically, the objective is just like dodgeball, but instead of throwing a ball, it's a rocket blasting at you that you need to airblast (compression blast (M2)) away at someone else."
Play TF2 its really fun but there shooting and blood
- Opens Game - Plays Versus - Fails Horribly - Plays MvM - Still Fails Horribly - Buys Hats To Feel Better  10/10 Would Waste Money Again.
"The game of Team Fortress 2 is very popular among many people including teens and adults. This first person online shooter is sure to give players a fun experience with its casual mode, MvM mode, competitive mode, community servers, and more. The game has nine classes to choose from to suit your gameplay. The classes are Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, Heavy and Spy. You are able to customize your loadout with certain weapons and you can customize your classes with hats or cosmetics. It also has a very deep backstory about brothers fighting over land after their father died. With nine years of development, this could be a game that you will enjoy."
"Welcome to tf2. You don't need to pay to win, but you need to pay for, like, everything else."
its free 11/10
Forgot to make a review on this game But 10/10 would burn other players in King of the hill :^)  Always use propane   *Hank hill approves* 
♥♥♥♥ing amazing game go play and buy lots of hats
"They just released valve servers for latin america so now i think is the best free 2 play game out there, and even the best multiplayer first person shooter but it's still not perfect.  9/10"
FPS.exe has stop responding would you like to close the program   (yes) (no)  error can not exit program too many free to plays   10/10
Great game :)
"life sucks and then you die  oh, and there's this"
"I don't trust anyone anymore, especially if they don't shoot their weapon...  11/10 -IGN and Hats Ltd"
hat hat hat hat hat hat hat hat hat hat hat hat hat hat hat hat hat hat hat
"I started a game, there was one with an unusual and aussies. He said: 'some of you may die, but that's the sacrifice I will make'.      He was scout      and died as first.   best game ever 10/10"
This game is awesome
It's free. Until you run out of backpack space and need expansions which leads to crates which leads to buying keys and so on. Then you discover MvM with the really cool stuff.   It's a money and time drain.
"9/10 homemaid MILFs rate this game the best ever, it has hats and clothes that they can spend their husband's money for."
Spent more money on this free game than on the rest of my 200 games put together  10/10 Need more hats
Press E one more time. See what happens.
"This game has lots of fun weapons and hats. Even though there aren't many weapons in the game, stranges, killstreaks, and others make the weapons more interesting and exiting. For the hats, there are unusuals and other effects. This makes the game more interesting. With all that, you can make different combinations. For example, instead of normal default weapons for the scout class, you can have drinks and food to fight with. This makes the game much more exciting. This is where hats come in. You can combine hats to make a crazed butt stabber or some kind of alien. That is still not all. You can win raffles to get items. There are taunts that look amazing. There are action slot to where you can hit 1 specific key and do a weird enchanting sound. Then there is mvm (man vs machines). This is where you can get australiums. That can really spice up the game. Well, have a great day everybody. :D"
This game is awesome!
You think you're safe when you get your back behind a wall only to get sniped by a sniper 11/10 would be sniped again!
"The 5 steps on playing TF2 Step 1: Git Gud Step 2: Keep it cool, Keep it clean, C'mon guys, It's 2015 Step 3: Get mad at Video Games Step 4: Eat the WHOLE ♥♥♥ Step 5: Kill yourself  Just follow these easy steps, you might be helpful to your team.  "
best game ever the gameplay is fast paced and exciting the game isn't pay to win  has 9 classes which all play differrently may get boring after sometime though
"Ruined my life and killed my wallet, gaben/10"
if you don't have a hat.  you're a fkboy.   nohat/10
Still can´t play spy.
I love how satisfied I feel when I win a gunfight with random crits.
"The best FPS game on steam. Fun, addictive, lots weapons, Hats. The best part... is that it's FREE."

"If you came here for a review on team fortress 2 you have come to the wrong place.

it's ok
"TF2 is a great game :D The class diversity, teamwork and overall gameplay make it amazing :D. Also, unusuals and australiums look sick xDD 11/10 would recommend."
Valve made more money from a Free To Play Games' Micro Transactions than it costs to make Certain Triple A games.   10/10 Would Buy a hat again.
I love this game 
Jerma is Mad  Vote: Washing Machine/10
Best Gamer ive ever played 10/10(Hat simulator)
So Really good game  reason:  1.Ninja Box Spy 2.MLG every where
"Dear Holy Gaben,  I hope you fix this bug... Its that in mvm (where I found it out) on wave 666 as spy you can disguise as enemy heavy then disguise as enemy engineer and the engineer will have minigun on the picture... Can I have a reward for finding this out?  -JukeBoxLuke"
Great game.

PUT REVIEW HERE. ENGINEER IS A SPY.
"a turn-based dungeon crawler with a twist: instead of controlling the hero you build the dungeon around him. Using cards drawn from your Guild decks you lay down rooms, monsters, traps and of course loot!"
This game is good fun. I'm only writing this review to get the pillar of community badge.
"Before I start, this is no unstated novel, PLAY IT is the general message.  I warn you though, if you are thinking 'SrsBusiness' or are generally a CoD player, YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS GAME Unless you are open to have FUN *Translation: Fun Nazis are NOT WELCOME*  Thats...really all I have to say, there'll still be the people who fit that general description so beware, thankfully hacking is VERY VERY LOW as Steam punishes it pretty quickly *Not even 1 hour will pass before the Hacker is Banned* and people usually get the message to NOT hack...Still there will be THOSE people, but it'll be *at least in my experience* in 1 game out of what? 50? 100?  This game is FREE, it is the shining example of good F2P Practices *There are no Direct Upgrades so much as Sidegrades to your stock weapons, and cosmetics are the only other thing you can get with Real World Money and THANK GOD FOR THAT! :D*  Have I mentioned you should play this game? I think I have plenty, so back to fighti-*Explodes into gibs*  EDIT: I still love the game, but right now? Have incredible patience and learn to LOVE your In-Game Web Browser as its the best way to kill time if there's nothing on TV...WOW I knew this update would be divisive but wow, its so divisive I'm torn in half! Anyone seen my body from the neck down?"
Like skyrim but with Hats and a f♥cked up economy. pay a crapton money on a hat that is litterly on fire.     10/10       Name   How fast       Scout   Sanic Fast       Name   Whats is in his pocket?       Heavy   A sandvich and a Medic     
"Great Game, Immersive game modes and awesome fun with friends  "
It's ok
Team Fortress 2:Free Forever (Mostly killing our wallets) Buy hats:Just hats Weapons:Depends Unusual:What a waste of time to get one Strange:Upgrading weapons by killing Vintage:Old weapons 
"People call it a hat simulator. That's because they're jealous. This is a very funny game suitable for any age. If you haven't got COD, this game is a bit like it, but with different kinds of weapons, not as much blood and gore, more game modes and in a cartoon version. Another awesome game by Valve."
this game wasted almost all my life... i like it
"Even if this game has gotten alot of hatred from how you spent alot of money, specially on some updates. This game is fun to play in a certain sense since you can decide to have different gameplay styles and team mechanics as almsot every fps has. But this is a comic fps and it still stands out for be one of the best that even has rip-offs. Team fortress shines and so the gameplay itself. and I'm done because its my opinon and I'm too lazy :v"
One of the best f2p's on Steam Does get abit borin after awhile.
TF2 IS AMAZE!!!!!!!!  OMG THX LORD GABEN U ARE AWSUME DOOD!!!
"Team Fortress 2 is like Call of Duty with actual fun, varied weaponry, teamplay and.. You know what, scrap that, it's not like Call of Duty at all. Team Fortress 2 is everything a person can look for in a FPS and more. (Hats!)  Blast your enemies (and yourself) in the air with an enormous bazooka, light them on fire, strategically blow their heads off and, to top it all off, stab them in the back with a masked Frenchman. Now that it's free to play as well, you have no excuse not to play it, unless you admit you're born as a fun-hating untermensch. Even if you were one, you could still play as our german medic, no hard feelings."
i don't have a life :D
An incredible game! I LOVE TF2
Best hat simulater 10/10 IGN.     I spent a lot of money on this game. Got a bill's hat. Got a scarf. Then selled them.  
"I'm not gonna lie. I suck at TF2. A lot. I'm really, really bad at it, and I don't think any amount of hours will fix it.  But part of the reason I suck is because the game isn't really balanced...   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=750973658  This is in Casual mode, mind you. Our team has three dominations, while the enemy team has 10... So, quite obviously, it's a fair and balanced game (their team also won the last round). I specfically play Casual so I don't have to deal with these pub stompers, people who have top tier strange weapons.  In addition to the lack of a fair and balanced game on that side, Valve has done a terrible job in balancing the actual game. One of the most egregious examples is a weapon known as the Righteous Bison. For a long time, the Righteous Bison could pierce multiple enemies, doing a load of damage. The  official  loading screen even said as much. With the last update, Valve called it a 'Bug' and subsequently 'fixed' it. In other words, they killed it's viability in any way and it's now even more of a joke weapon than it was before.  There a lot of reports going around that Valve doesn't even play TF2 anymore, and simply looks at data and then 'fixes' bugs it sees. Valve doesn't listen to it's player base and nor does it even play the game they own (if the rumors are true).  TF2 isn't a good game anymore. For someone that sucks, at least I could have a little bit of fun. But no longer. I'll still play it, but that doesn't mean my 13 kills to 19 deaths is gonna get any better.  EDIT: There are also some huge issues with the way Valve have been doing things for a while now. The example I'll use are the Polycount set items. There would be a set of items that would provide a nice bonus for the player who had the items in the set. So, for example, the Tank Buster set would allow Soldiers with the full set to take 20% less damage from Sentrys. This was a good system... And it's now been replaced with the ability to leave a calling card on your victim. This is totally useless compared to the previous buff. Why this was remove, I have no idea. But it's clear that Valve had no clue what to do with the item sets, so they just hard nerfed it like that.  Come on Valve. I know you're better than that."
THIs GAME IS THE DEFINITION OF AIDS TAKING A ♥♥♥♥ ON YOU WHILE HAVING GONORRHEA
"*sighs* Valve... I'm disappointed in you, to say the least. You did good with the massive VAC bans and much-needed other fixes, but it didn't take long for you to release yet another of the worst updates I've ever seen. I have just one question to sum things up here: did you just give up, or what?  I could spend all day talking about just what decisions in recent memory went wrong with this game's development, but would it really make any difference if I did? Because frankly, it doesn't seem like you care about what your players want. Your updates are terrible, your weapon changes are unblanced jokes (for example, buffing what were already the two most hated weapons in the whole game, those being the Phlogistinator and the Gunslinger), your public matchmaking servers still have so many glaring problems that at this point I'm refusing to even give them the time of day they don't deserve, and it no longer resembles the teamwork-encouraging, goofy loaded-with-cartoony-nonsense but nonetheless fair and enjoyable game TF2 once was (and that's even with my computer being the low--memory piece of garbage it is; I didn't care because I legitmately enjoyed this game anyway. Or used to). And you have done NOTHING to fix any of that.  Honestly, even whenever I get my hands on a better one I may not ever come back to this game at this rate. It was fun while it lasted and if you had asked me whether I'd reccommend TF2 two years ago I'd have said yes without question, but I don't feel like I can do that anymore. You should be ashamed for what you let happen to it. Start making an effort for some real quality and good game design and don't get lazy or sloppy in the middle. Maybe THEN I'll reconsider.  But until then, to anyone else asking whether to try this game I would ultimately say... don't waste your time."
"Team fortress used to be a great community shooter; But that all changed when Meet Your Match attacked In all honesty though, despite the hours I have sunk into this game, i cannot recommend it in its current state. Since the meet your match update, I have personally not enjoyed the game as much and I also believe the game has lost its flair. I have made many long term friendships from this game, but the game itself just has such a limited social aspect to it now since the introduction of matchmaking, both casual and competitive. Valve, i honestly wish I could agree with all the changes you have made to this masterpiece, but I don't think it will ever reach its former glory of the past. "
tf2 is very fun game im like play engineer
"Tf2 is a fun hat tasick game, but there are to many tryhards in Normal mode and the caual and competive need work they suck :C"
"If you ever see anyone post a negative review for this game, they're just salty about a new update :P"
"Honestly, it is a fun game from time to time. The graphics are stylized, the community is still staying strong almost a decade later, you gotta give it credit. It's a shame that valve simply does not care for the game anymore in my opinion. At least try it once, you might just like it."
a nice game. lots of different modes to play
10/10 Destroyed my life.
"Great game for those who like those First Person Shooters, but with a kick of comedy. Gameplay is amazing, graphic are very well done, and the communtiy just keeps growing and growing. Although the game it self is very well amazing I do have a few complaints. One I like how they kept the rankings from 'Gun Mettle', but I don't like how they just keep adding crates for you to buy more keys. Second Most of the updates we get are cosmetic updates not really just weapon based (Yes technically Gun Metlle did add some new 'weapons' but they are more skins then actual new stat weapons). Other than these two minor complaints that I may only have the game is a great game so I would really recomend it to well anyone out there who can play it."
Well It's Just Tf2
gud game would play again.
"I don't even know where to begin. 1.5k hours after I started, still fun. Endless fun and it's still being updated. I certainly do recommend this game to others, as it is amazing. I'm averaging about a little over 100 hours per two weeks with this game. Though it can be frustrating and rage inducing, its what makes it fun, learning, and fighting, and murdering, and taunting after every kill, then getting backstabbed, and then backstabbing that person back. I've put so much money into this virtual game, It's just that addicting. So, you should play it."
I had a life and a very nice family then I started playing this game.
"Amazing game. You will never run out of things to do on Team Fortress 2. Along with normal gameplay, there are many custom mods and servers to choose from. Pick this game up for fun, addictive gameplay, plus, its FREE. No harm done if you don't like it."
A very fun game!! Everyone should give it a try at least once!
This a first person shooter game with 9 classes that fight for a leader and try to win the enemy teams side 
"Tf2 is a really fun game, i recommend it, believe in me if you really like tf2 you will buy hats :P."
"TF2? WHAT IS TF2? AN EASY WAY OF LOOKING AT IT IS THAT IT'S NOT A FPS, IT'S A FASHION SHOW! TF2 WILL TEACH YOU MANY SKILLS AND LIFE LESSONS LIKE TO NEVER BOTHER SOMEONE WHO IS EATING A SANDVICH, OR TO NOT WEAR A HAT AS AN EXCUSE TO GET YOUR ♥♥♥ KICKED! TF2 IS ABOUT FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE, OR JUST HAVE A FULL TEAM OF ENGINEERS TO ANNOY THE OTHER TEAM! TF2 WILL SURPRISE ANYONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHAT THE GAME IS LIKE, BECAUSE WITH ALL THE TECHNIQUES AND HIDDEN FEATURES, IT WILL MAKE ANY COD PLAYER RAGE QUIT AND UNINSTALL, BUT IF YOU DECIDE TO ACCEPT THIS JOURNEY, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF IN AN AMAZING WORLD OF BEAUTIFUL COLORS, OF COURSE, IF YOU WEAR PROUDLY YOUR PYROVISION GOGGLES AND HOLD DOWN M1 TO KILL, I MEAN, PLAY AROUND WITH YOUR BUDDIES THAT ARE BURNING, I MEAN, DANCING. SO GO ON! PLAY TF2 AND DISCOVER ALL KINDS OF UNUSUAL THINGS THAT ONLY HAPPEN HERE, TEAM FORTRESS 2, THE ULTIMATE HAT SIMULATOR!"
Play TF2. Buy a bunch of games. Continue playing TF2. Got some sick deals during the Steam Summer Sale. Still play TF2.
Best game iv ever played you need to stop reading these reviews and get it already!
"This game is cool.   How to be pro- 1. Get 100$ and buy ♥♥♥♥ tons of keys 2. Wait for em to become tradable 3. Buy Unusuals,Australium, if you don't have enough keys, Add more Funds. 4. get burning unusuals/ scorching 5. go to farming server and rank up your australium to hale's own 6. go to random server, and people will praise you  Such good game  I rate it 9/11 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)   BONUS DUCKS ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
"I used to love TF2 because of the team dynamic, the fun classes, and the creativity of the game overall, but now the game is an utter mess. I am pretty sure there is only 2 people at Steam that are working on this game and because of that, the game has gone down hill. The game is more unbalanced that ever before with people able to make guns from Steam Workshop, serious lag, and new updates are continuously destroying the game's matchmaking. I wish I could say I recommend this game, but I can't say that until the game is fixed."
"Community is really fun and friendly, Events are fun, a lot of good things about this game.  except f2p's that ruin the fun ._."
"Play this game only if you are willing to dedicate the following: Your wallet, your time, what's left of your sanity, your family, your friends, your pet(s), and last but not least, your soul to Valve's devil, Gaben Newell.  11/10, quit stealing my wallet."
The best game ever! I recommend to new fps players and you can sell your items when u don`t want it for steam money 
" Conclusion/TLDR at the bottom   Team Fortress 2 is a class based FPS shooter game where you complete various objectives on one of the 2 only teams: BLU and RED. There are 9 distinctive classes to play as. Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy. Each has a different purpose and each has many weapons to use.  But this review isn't about stuff like that. It's about the more recent updates that Valve has been releasing.   The Gun Mettle Update."
"Things I gave to Team Fortress 2 : 1. Money 2. Time 3. Love  Things Team Fortress 2 gave me: 1. Arthritis 2. Rage 3, Hatred of Russians,Spanish, and Russians 4. Broken keyboard 5. Broken mouse  6. 9/10 ready 7. Server crashes 8. ☆☆☆☆☆☆ teammates 9. Multilingual cursing - I guess this is a good thing?! 10. Lag 11. Cheaters 12.'Ez Pz' spam 13. Competitive matches  Essentially - TF2 is a greedy, but I love it all the time.  11 / 10 would play again"
"Great game funny, random, and fast. This game has never ending playability "
"Do you like shooting people? Do you like virtual hats? If you said yes to one or more of these, then this game is for you!  It comes with ~Hats! ~Guns! ~Bumper cars in hell~ ~More hats! ~Ridiculous melee weapons! ~Shirts! ~Boots! ~Glasses! ~AND EVEN MORE HATS!  This FPS is probably the most fun you will ever have in the history of hats. Did I mention that we like hats? Oh, and taunts, too! This game gets a 10/10 from Cthulhu, Inc."
"In the time that I did play the game, I genuinely enjoyed it, proven by the time spent on it on my profile. Please understand that if this review does seem harsh, take note that I did genuinely enjoy the game during the time that I did play it. However, that does not mean it will stop me from voicing my heaviest criticisms about the game, and it eventually burned me out due to a few things in particular. I apologize in advance, but I absolutely despise these things I'm going to be talking about.  #1: Cosmetics  I'm sorry, but I simply cannot stand cosmetic items in any game at all that are made simply for showing off to others or for appearance. The only exception to this is if you genuinely put hours of work and grinding into obtaining this item. Factors such as money and luck do not count towards this genuine work and grinding, no exceptions. If you were to simply pay a dollar or two on a cosmetic, then you should be ashamed, no offence. If you were to put time and effort into unlocking an item that you wanted which does not involve luck or money of any kind, then I applaud you.  #2: Microtransactiosn  As for Team Fortress 2, the online store is not always bad. There are various weapons or items that are not for show and can genuinely help you in battle that can be bought from this store. However, I must warn you that the temptation of buying things off of the store has actually caused some people to spend hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on these items for the purpose of decorating their characters in-game. While I do understand reasoning as to why Valve offers this option, given that the game is free, I do not and cannot sympathize nor agree with their decision to do this.  #3: The game's authenticity  I'm not entirely sure if it's just me, but when I see a Scout wearing a fancy cosmetic outfit, then I really can't take the game seriously anymore for the war scene that it's trying to create. It's just so incredibely difficult for me to believe that anyone could take this game seriously as a first person shooter depicting a war between two mercenary groups involving a deep backstory, which is actually quite good. As a matter of fact, I rarely see, if at all, cosmetics portrayed in the comic book series, lore, or videos on YouTube that Valve has created, such as their 'Meet The' series. While it is true they tend to put humurous or comedic things in these videos or comics to keep the mood light-hearted and enjoyable for young children, I do not believe it even comes close to the extent of the actual game.  #4: Events  I truthfully cannot see the appeal in these events. Most prominently is the Halloween events, which I absolutely despise. First off, I am biased on this part as I do despise the actual Halloween holiday in real life, so it's no surprise that these events would turn me away almost instantly. To give you a genuine answer, the only holiday event I can say I remotely enjoyed was, quite obviously, the Christmas event. I really don't understand why, but there's just something about Christmas that makes almost anything at least somewhat enjoyable when you put Christmas in it. Additionally, I really think that these events should be kept for the most prominent and popular of holidays, like Halloween and Christmas, despite my hatred against the former. As for lesser holidays like Valentine's Day or Thanksgiving, I legitimately cannot think of any place that these could fit into for Team Fortress 2, and I have my doubt that any of the mercenary characters, based on their individual personalities, would enjoy either of these holidays as it is, at least to the extent of Halloween or Christmas.  Verdict:  If you are a person who is looking for a free game that has a genuinely fun multiplayer experience, then Team Fortress 2 could be a good game for you. If you are, at all, familiar with other multiplayer Valve titles such as Left 4 Dead or Counter Strike, then you will immediately recognize Team Fortess 2's multiplayer, as it runs off of the same engine as the last two games, the Source Engine. If you aren't bothered by cosmetics in a videogame, then this could also be a good title for you to play. However, be warned that, because Team Fortress 2 is entirely free to download, the game is an enourmous victim of hacking, griefers, spam, and otherwise annoying people. Thus, I suggest you be careful about which servers you join."
"Im being bullied in school becauce of the hours ive wasted on this game, but its worth it"
"They greatest team based shooter of all time, even if valve is treating the game like trash its till a great game. and i have faith valve wil pick it up. like i said best team based shooter out there 999999/10 would play forever."
It's fun. It's clever. It's random. And they are hats in it. You can't forget the hats.
Its alright.
"This game ruined my life It drove away my friends I've lost all my real skills My family is ashamed of me I've spent all my money on hats Now I'm a miserable man living in a box on the side of the street Nobody knows me, loves me, cares about me, every person that still understood me has left my side Now I don't know what to do, I may commit suicide, and then maybe people will see me, on the headlines, one last time  I am lost.  10/10"
"Team Forstress 2, it's a so called 'fps' 'or first pirson shooter' game where u play as one of 9 diffrent classes Scout, Solider; Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, medic, Sniper and Spy.

of course the game is so fun
its one of the best games i have :)
Someone gifted me a golden frying pan.. Looked cool but I needed Steam money. So I sold on the community market for 99 cents.   11/10 Would community market again!
"I plaid it for a while, and i think it's alright."
'Capture the Flag' best game mode''' :)
best starting game on steam. period.
This game is awesome
"Best online Multi player shoot em up game ever! and better yet,its free. get it!"
Do you like hats? Do you like playing first person shooters? Do you want the ability to rocket jump unlike in CoD? Do you want to waste money on pointless stuff that will give you amazing abilities?  THIS GAME IS FOR YOU
Amazing game bit different to the normal Fps game but it is a chaos load of fun with a dash of crazy
this GAYm is gay like you
"I have a dream that one day, it will be perfectly acceptably for a large russian man wearing a ridiculous amount of hats to throw plates with deli lunches at pedestrians and be considered friendly."
"Despite having it's occasional quirks, this game is a pretty solid PvP shooter."
Come back and try the game whenever Valve digs it out of the current ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rut that it's in right now.
amazing game but should be worked on
This game is great to play with my lads and by myself when my lads are not there. amen
Whack frenchmans with a wrench 10/10 Whack russians with a fish 10/10 Whack a spy with his own severed arm 10/10  my only problem with this game: you still can't slap peoples with hats
"When I started playing I had no idea what's going on. When I started donating, I thought that it's all about hats. When I got more keys, I started to think about unusuals. But they are useless.  When I sold the unusual and bought taunts - I realised what TF2 is all about.  It's all about fun and trolling! I bought group dances, and when my team is starting to win the game - I'm making a party near spawn. A lot of people are dancing, and tryhards are so mad...  At the end party poopers show up and headshot/backstab us all.  10/10"
you sould make more hats in tf2 
If I didn't play this game I'd probably live a good life
Played it with the right friends and made abominations
my second game on Steam ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆
"Not good.Well, not bad either, it was just better before."
I hate it.
This game is awesome when I found this game I couldn't stop playing it! :D Thumbs up
"This is a good game thou but there is a problem 'GABEN PLS LET ME UNBOX SOMETHING GOOD!' i unbox like over 50 crates and not even a unusual, most people like thwy bought 10 crates and bruh... UNUSUAL !!!   I am actualy a little bored maybe coz i played it for long time ?IDK maybe...  .:) :) :)"
10/10 would bake stabe again
"I think that this game TF2, is a really good game and that everyone can enjoy it, but just remove the phlog and the little 8 year olds and the game would be 100% way better"
War-Themed Hat Simulator 9001/10
"Why are you reading this you know its gonna be good. You probably got steam just to play this game. Well i can ramble all day how good it is but you probably knew that already. Now go click that play now button to download and play the game Its not like you havent. But if you are still reading this, STOP,Now go and play"
Team Fortress 2 is the best game ever maded! I say that you should play this game!
hats
^-^
Ruined myself over some stupid hats.  It's fun.  10/10
the best way to have fun with friends without taking it to far. best way to start with steam and valve
"This game is awesome, its crazy and funny :D I like how they added hats and stuff."
"A fun FTP FPS game, but you need to be patient. At first, you get only 'stock' weapons and equipment, which while okay, is not nearly as good as what you can buy or eventually recieve. Additionally, Valve often changes things in the game, so an item you once loved may become much worse with no warning. In general, though, this is still a fairly good game."
Great game 10/10. woul play again :D
I love it. 10/10. this is the game that made me love steam and have so many friends :D
"  This game is pretty good.  Will Overwatch beat TF2? Maybe competitively. However TF2 is still a more chilled and lay backed game.  This is very evident in the laid back forever 2 fort games and the many silly game modes and maps. Thats kinda the thing about Overwatch VS TF2. If you don't feel like being competetive in TF2, then you can do silly fun things like Super Smash Bros, Wario Inc, Randomizer, Prop Hunt, and 10x mode.  So all though TF2 will always hold a special place in my heart, you may also want to consider Overwatch for competetive play."
"You will happily open your wallet to Gaben, and he will give you cool hats."
This game is one of my all time favorites :)
Spent 1000+ hours on this game.  Expected to get an awesome hat/paint drop.    Gives me a crate and said 'Gift for spending 1000 hours on our game'
"I downloaded this game not too long ago and I haven't played it much, but I still find it quite fun and do recommend it since it's fun and free"
"a good game,i really like the atmosphere here,u can have a lot of fun in this game.Too may charactors with there special abilities,no. of weapons just makes it awesome"
"An extremely good game, I would recommend anyone to get it, even just to check it out! Pros:  - Lots of gameplay! I could play this game for many times the amount I already have, and be able to do different things each time I turned it on! - Graphics! Although they are different, they are very enjoyable to play with, very soft colour and nothing too 'out there.' The hitboxes match the player models quite well, although lag messes them up. - Items! Although people say they are pointless, they are fun to have and distinguish you as a player, you can even go so far as to trick enemies with your cosmetics! - Casual Gameplay! One of the main reasons I like this game is because you can mess around in it! Playing other games is always fun, but the competitive environment makes people salty and makes it less enjoyable for me. Tf2 is a casual game in which you can mess around as much as you like, this is why I play it! Cons:  - Server Finding! Recently it has been difficult to find servers, and they are often imbalanced, although Valve has fixed most of this up, the lack of autobalance is still a problem.  9/10 Game!"
I like this game its fun to play. Whenever you play games these days its 'Oh I got hurt.. I'll just hide behind this for a second and go back into action (Sucks) this however you need to collect health packs or have things with stats that heals you or prey that there is a Medic nearby.
"=￣ω￣=POOTIS SPENCER APPROVED! This is a really really reeaaalllyyyy awesome game, you can find stuff and explore an infinite array of maps and it is Dr dangerously addictive and there's so many classes to choose from and many great people^•^♥"
Holy ♥♥♥♥ game is cancer
i think i had a social life before i played this.
Let's hope valve fixes this even though they won't and will try to copy overwatch.
"it's okay I guess, really would help if I spent more time on it."
Its nice that valve after 9 years still update the game but some updates are real ♥♥♥♥  420/360 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"Coming back to this game is a confusing mess. There's a lot of new weapons and no good resources available to research what they do. Competitive matchmaking is a good addition but 9 years late. While other Valve games receive the Source2 engine upgrade, this game did not. In conclusion, too little too late and a last ditch effort by Valve to keep this game relevant."
"This game was a lot of fun before the MYM update. Now I can't even play the game unless I have 120+ ping on every server I join. I can't talk to random people anymore without it being very short and it's just become an awful mess I can't play. If Valve fixes this update or brings back pubs I would recommend this game to everyone. But in it's current state, this is not a good or fun game."
"Wannabe Overwatch after the recent MYM update, Thankfully we still have community severs as the last remnence of old tf2."
"*Day one in the new update*:  -'TF2 oooohhh one of my favorite games! It have a new update. Let's check it out! *watch the prize to play comp.* Whaaaat?! 10$ to play the game? Ohh please Valve you must be kidding me...Wait it was a good game :(. What happened? *Writing to the Steam Support, but browser crashed* Ohhh hell no i think i should write a review but...yes let's go write it'  First off all sorry for my bad english!!! TF:GO was TF2 but since the 'Gun Metle' update it's a piece of sh!t it was fun but as you can see before the crappy updates it was 93% VERY POSITIVE(!!!) but now it's only 67% MIXED(!!!) If you think I'm right please write to support this message: 'TF:GO (or in the old times: TF2) Was good until these crappy updates. Please Valve give us BACK the old TF2' please guys It's only 0.001% updates will be deleted but hope die last!"
"I was gone for a few a while, and what happened to this game? Matchmaking? Am I on xbox live?  Well, TF2 WAS one of the best multiplayer shooters of all time, but now..."
"I like tf2 as much as anyone. It was my first pc game and it will be my favorite game forever, which is why I give it a thumbs up, but the new version is unacceptable. Back when the game was at the top, valve came out with half-decent updates, though some frustrating ones too. It was something that you have to play once and you'd love it. Valve has made some bad decisions in the meet your match update. Back then you could jump in with random people, given they weren't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and have fun. Now valve made it so those days are gone. Most people are mad at this and I am as well because to see a great game like tf2 to transform into a game it's really not ever going to be makes me a bit mad. Valve made it more inportant to make people use money to buy passes and premium editions for competative play instead of letting people have fun. Some may disagree with me and say I'm just another person crying that Tf2 is dead, but I want to make this game better and valve isn't doing much for tf2 so all in all I still play it but you can make your choice."
Having come to this game again and again over the years it truly has gone downhill for a while now. After almost 10 years valve updates teh game with COMP matchmaking and its feels tacked the ♥♥♥♥ on. TF2 still isnt optimized and runs like crap on newer systems.  Valve clearly doesn't care about this game nor do they care about Counter strike as well. Let this game die. Valve isnt the same company they were years ago.
First thing I did when I got on a server 360 no scoped someone 5 times then he rage quit cause i was to pro for him. After that messed around and ate a pizza while doing so. Finally Destroyed a friend to the point of her submitting then left happy the end.
"Meet your match? Valve, you ♥♥♥♥ed up."
"Probably the lamest game I've ever played, but I played with my friend Sam and it was amazing. He's so good at this game holy moley macaroni."
My reaction to the Meet Your Match update:   https://youtu.be/ZWphqA1Slrw?t=1m6s 
"I recomend this game because I like shooter games and you can play with friends in multiplayer,in coop,and sometimes in singleplayer. I like our taunts is so funny and their moves and voices are so...so funny. Also I like it because it have a lots of achievements and you can unlock a lots of weapons and you can buy some items on the shop like the design and other weapons so I start to play and i like it at the first time when i played. I wish you goodluck and continue playing in this game."
Team Fortress 2 is like yogurt.    What do you prefer Yogurt or Friends?   Yogurt    Thats what I thought.
This game is one of the most awesome game that I have played so far and I hope I play it again soon.
Awsome Game!
"installed the game :  -played like a noob at first -got my first hat, a gibus -and pyrovisions -saw people playing with better hats -saw the community market -bought some hats -so ♥♥♥♥♥ happy -some1 want to trade with me for some unusual -accepted -acc got hacked -cried like a ♥♥♥♥♥ -gaben came and sells unusuals for extreme low price -2bad pc broke -cried like a ♥♥♥♥♥ agan   10/10 would still play again"
"you can do allot in this game:role play,collect hats,troll,specialize yourself in a weapon,make fun of how broken the game can be,play competitive and spent you're money. this game recommended becouse its free has allot of gameplay and ways to play the game and is overall fun (PSif you play allot of realistic fps games this will feel weird)."
Plays Tf2 Kills a f2p kid kid screams  Ears bleed Closes Tf2 Exits Steam Sees a doctor  Enjoys life  10/10 
Great game! Tons of fun!!
U can spend free time
"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 15, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway  4.20/10 would buy rope and a stool again'  "
If you haven't played this game you must have no life.
This is the best game ever :D
It ok
"team fartfest 2 is a nicely crafted arena shooter with 9 classes to choose from. the gameplay revolves around completing objectives such as capturing points, pushing bombs, and sitting around taunting in spawn for six hours. however, every single server usually has a main of any class, who think they're top kek because they play iron UGC Highlander.  the community as a whole is a cancer, and i'd recommend avoiding it if you're tired of LoL's community, and lenny face spam. while the classes at times don't feel balanced, and people care more about hats, the game is enjoyable and a very fun competitive arena shooter.  except spy.  spy is a fuggin' piece of trash."
"One of the Best Free-to-Play Games Ever in history  Pros And Cons  -Very Nice And Balanced Gameplay -Smooth And Very Cartoony Gameplay -Great Variety Of Maps,Weapons, and Gamemodes -Has A Trading Community -You can actually earn money from this Game! -Amazing Community! Alot of Servers,Groups,Communities and OTHERS!!! -A Game that has Cosmetics and hats! Pimp up your Character and make him look good! -Balanced and different Gameplay styles of other classes  Cons  - TF2 Economy is dying down real quick  I think thats the only con! oh wait   -TOO MANY GOD DAMN HATS Theres another Big one  Well, thx for Reading!"
"This is how the classes were made.  It all begins with spy meeting scouts mom. Spy meets scout’s mom and BANGS her and Scout or FemScout (Depending on timeline) eventually gets born and then scouts mom dies from cancer that she got from a butterfly. Spy realises that scout is going to fail at life, so he goes back in time to tell past spy that he shouldn’t BANG scouts mom because scout is going to suck. Whilst doing so, Spy kills the butterfly that gives scouts mom cancer. Past Spy however tells Spy, “OH HEEEEELL NAH DAT ♥♥♥ IS TOO GOOD” and continues to BANG her. Scout gets born and scouts mom tells scout that a future spy was going to tell past spy not to TRIPLE BANG scouts mom and this makes scout sad. Scout wants to impress spy so he joins the army and becomes a soldier. While on the field, he watches his dad be burnt by a pyro and watches his dad die. This causes depression and so he becomes a fat hoovy. Hoovy becomes so depressed he tries to kill himself and then gets sent to an insane asylum. He loses weight and becomes sniper. He is eventually driven mad. He becomes so mad, that he starts to experiment with the science of healing and creates the medigun and pees in jars. He then called himself the medic. His sanity however, is driven even more mad, and becomes Laurence Robert Harvey and makes a Human Centipede. His sanity drops even more so that he creates a flamethrower, becomes pyro, and burns his Centipede, then goes on a rampage. Whilst in his rampage, he runs into a time machine and goes back to when his father was alive and burns him to death by accidental left clicking, but in reality his father was burnt to hell but luckily had a dead ringer. This cause extreme tissue damage and so he becomes demo. Engie lived happily ever after as Spies neighbor wondering what the hell was going on a block away and said “Nope” as his neck stretched and broke the ceiling scaring the crap out of a butterfly and then gave the butterfly very contagious butt cancer. THE END.  "
I love this GAME!
"People love this game for hats. But for me, eh. Better to kill like a man and look like an idiot than to look awesome and do as much damage as those lil' kids on COD.  But if you love hats and conga, buy this game, regardless of the fact that the game's free.  HATS!!!"
"An over the top, cartoony FPS that offers Virtual Hats &amp; Unusual Effects to satisfy your fashionable needs and plenty of firearms to quench your lust for blood and honor."
"One of the best F2P FPS games out there, lots of weapon variety and hats, lots of hats. The economy is great and lots of fun people that you can find, occasional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s but they can be fun to mess around with. The only bad thing about it that I can think of are the kids that spam mics. Otherwise, 10/10."
"Team Fortress 2 is a first person shooter, with tons of awesome weapons and yes,? HATS, with a trading community and steam market community. There is a team RED and BLU, yes spelled 'BLU', and it has so many ways to play like, Capture the Flag, Payload, and more. Oh and did I mention it's FREE"

"So I attended E3 and got to have a special one on one confrence with Gabe himself. He showcased a new game that was to be officially released on the third of July 2015. The name of the game?  Counter Fortresss Global Teamfensive: The Sequel (also known as CFGT)  Take a read of this exclusive interview with Gabe I managed to record (don't worry it's not IGN).  - start of interview -   Me:  Why hello Lord Gaben, I'm here to talk to you about your new game, Counter Fortresss Global Teamfensive: The Sequel. Share with me all the special details about the game if you'd be so kind to, from start to finish. I would also like to know how you came up with the idea on the game. I know you've always been disclosed about your games at Valve, but you can trust me, I'm not recording this.    Lord Gabe:  Hello to you too. I'd be very proud to talk about our new game, and our innovative approach to this new game. It came along this one confrence we had. It went like this.  '♥♥♥♥ TF2 IS ♥♥♥♥ING UP' 'I KNOW WHAT DO WE DO' -random guy in corner, turns his chair in slow motion- ' we make tf2... COUNTER STRIKE' -everyone celebrates-  So we've decided to borrow some inspiration from our money cow- I mean popular game Counter Strike, but we kept everything that made the game good (to us) and took the gameplay from our best selling free to play game Team Fortress 2. We've introduced brand new exclusive Stattra- I mean strange weapons that you can unbox from very special cases. These weapons have a kill count attatched to the side of the weapon, something no game has ever done before. We've also decided to give players a unique opportunity to chip in $6 to a pass where they can earn never before seen, rarity of weapons by appearance going in the order of, Factory New, Minimal Wear, Field-Tested, Well-Worn and Battle Scarred. We believe that by adding these features, we'll gain even more players, and hopefully forget about that disaster game Team Fortress 2 and it's economy that we slipped up with by giving people what they wanted. You also get to earn a unique coin that can be displayed in game to show off to everyone you've participated in a very special coin, again another feature that's unique to our game. We really tried our hardest to make a unique first person shooter experience in our new game, Counter Fortresss Global Teamfensive: The Sequel. We hope you enjoy the game that hits you this Summer.    Me:  Ah... Urh ok.. Thanks for your time um Gabe? I look forward to when you announce Half Life 3 sometime in the next decade.    Lord Gabe:  Don't worry my friend, that's never going to happen.    Me:  You cruel man. How could you do this!?  - end of interview here -   Unfortunately that's all I could get on Counter Fortresss Global Teamfensive: The Sequel (CFGT), and Half Life 3 before Gaben called the illuminati and threw me out. But I hope this is enough for you steam readers.   1 like = 1 prayer for half life 3."
teh best game it should be the game of the year
"The game that has a class for every fps + ping variation  High Ping, Low FPS: Engineer  High Ping, High FPS: Medic  Low Ping, Low FPS: Pyro, Heavy  Low Ping, High FPS: Scout, Soldier, Demo, Sniper, Spy  'Great Game,' says the man who mains engineer."
It is an amazing game. I highly suggest picking it up. All I can say.
"Hi, it's me, BaconScrambledEggs. I hope you will     It's about time; I have 1000 hours in the game; I have spent countless days trading; plenty of my time was spent making scripts and huds.  But why did I countinue to play? Why did I continue to keep doing something I have done for countless times? It's simple, really. Team Fortress 2 is a wonderful game, and it should remain that way for many years.  I picked up this game, thinking Team Fortress 2 would be one of those pick up, play, and throw away games. I spent one hour, then 2, then 4 hours playing TeamFortress. It captured me. I believe this is a spell many people fall into. The fun I had was wonderful! That is when I decided to become a 'Pay to Play.'After I spent my 5 dollars on this game, I don my Mann Co Hat proudly. I played pubs and practiced my aim, like any player.  When you play this game more, you learn more. Such as trading in-game items, and making scripts. Learned the concept of zero to hero. Learning this, I took off my Mann Co Hat, and I decided to 'go into' this game. I spent days to obtain my Professional Killstreak Scatter, and spent days on days learning how to become competitive. This brings me onto the subject of 'free to plays'. For new players, this is a slang we use to refer newbies. 'Exp' players tend to make fun of these 'f2p's' Don't feel blamed, feel free to spray flames as a pyro. And feel free to just smack people with your bat.   I love this game, and despite it's flaws, it's perfect in my mind. 'Lord Gaben' has granted us many great things. Enjoy the game, wear your hats in pride, and, most importantly, have fun!"
Great game. Period
987.8 hours of ignoring my girlfriend.
"Its a real great game, fun for any age, easy to learn and great to play, and best of all IT'S FREE TO PLAY!!!!!!"
"awesome. no reason not to play I repeat,   NO REASON   not to play"
"Team Fortress 2. A game that not only allows you to murder strangers over the internet, but lets you talk to other people using a voice and chat system. Not only that you can unlock multiple weapons for free you could buy at mann co store, selling you hundreds of items including hats, weapons, keys, etc. Mann vs Machine. You probally already seen it. You and your team against a horde of robots. So do I recommend this game? The answer is clear, Of course! Team Fortress 2 is THE game to play when bored. Trust me I get bored alot. Althrough Team Fortress 2 is a bit hard to get into at first, after playing it for a while it can be very addicting. If you are a Call of Duty fan and loved the Call of Duty franchise before you played Tf2, then Team Fortress might not be the best fitting game for you as you can't aim excluding the snipers. Thats all I have to say. I hoped you enjoyed my reveiw."
"Without competitive aspect this game get me playing it for more than 200 hours. When you suck with 8 different roles, its good to have 9 classes in the game to master. Whereas you are most useless spy in the server, just camping with sniper, running around like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with scout or rage quiting server after demoman is destroyed all your buildings, you can always go back with medic, hold m1 and dream that one day you will rekt server.   In fact, that day never came."
THIS GAME IS AWSOME MUST DOWNLOAD NOW IF YOU DON'T WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH YOUR LIFE
"It's alright, but I wouldn't spend more than 20 minutes playing it"
this game increases your chances of having lethal quantam banter with the lads sponsored by nandos and ayy lmao dank memes lol 24_xxxquantbantsm842xx_99
i need less free time
Hat Fortress 2
I LUV DIS GAME ITS LIKE DA THING THAT TAKES ALL YOUR MONEY AND TIME AWAY BUT U STILL LOVE IT.... THEY CALL THEM GIRLFRIENDS 
"Team Fortress 2 is a fast paced, multiplayer game that use team work to achieve the objective. This game allows players to see that good cooperation with the team is more important than single handedly versus the enemy team.    Pros   -Detailed Graphics -Multiple classes to choose from -balanced items -teaches people the ability to cooperate -cosmetics that allow you to change characters' appearances    Cons   -some weapons are unmatched to other weapons -most people don't know how to be a team player -skill difference is fairly large -no competitive match making systems -uses money to expand your inventory"
"A very fun and unique team based game that will bring you lots of fun, as long as you're not a pyrovision gibus W+ M1 pyro."
This game got me chronicly addicted to ingame accesorries
"Enemy sniper killed me, started playin on his saxophone, and then a friendly spy come out of nowhere and backstabbed him and laughed. Aaaand an another enemy came and tauntkilled him. The whole server laughed at us. 10/10"
this game rock
No junt no this community give's me cancer but the game over all is good but valve make's to much money of CS:GO and TF skin's and now all of you are focusing on your VR set. Oh and i love how i can NOT see the respawn time on casual
Just Download It Already
"A game that which everyone should try at some point. It's very fun to play with other friends and has multiple game modes to suit people. If you think you'll stay in the game and you're F2P, go ahead and buy something cheap, it's only worth investing money on cosmetics and such if you know you'll stay."
We must defend gibus engineers. Stay in tf2 and save all gibus engis
Bring back pubs.
"i have played tf2 for a ling time whit A lot of my good Friends , and the latest update is Not that great , but its still tf2 . I would be awesome if they got the quik play back do, and as i said , this meet your mach update , not everyone whants to play competitive ."
I absolutley love this game. Ive been playing it for maney years and There aint a day I get tired of it. Rock on merc's!
"Over 1700 hours and counting and I still cannot play this game with a straight face. The characters are hilarious, the weapons are hilarious, the gameplay is much more balanced than the vast majority of free to play games, no stupidly overpowered weapons (ok maybe a few are a LITTLE overpowered). In what other game do you get to throw ♥♥♥♥ at people then run at them with a machete, kill people by making a finger gun and saying 'POW', eat buckets of chicken over the corpses of your enemies, whack people with giant candy canes, shank people with an icecicle and hide in a box and watch people walk by? All the while you are calling people 'cowards, babies, teeny men, wankas, dummkofs, maggots and other funny insults in the various amusing accents the mercs have."
"The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start."
Wheres that 'Team Deathmatch' MatPat was talking about ?
Just like Overwatch but with Heavys and Spycrabs instead of booties and waifus
Like overwatch but better and has other weapons and hats or outfits
It's ok.
"TF2, let me start with this, it's a game for multiple people. You like trading games? Well tf2 has trading servers, you like duels, try MGE, you like a team VS 1 Powerful Boss, Go play VSH there are endless possibilities to what you can do in TF2! Pros: +Lots of differences in Servers +Mostly Friendly Community +It's a F2P game +You can easily make a map and share it online +You also can create mods and again, share it online +Skins are something you can get yourself (Won't work on Valve servers and some servers with sv_pure 1 (Which is a command) +Lots of minigames :)  Cons: -You have to get atleast 1 item to become premium in this game (However it's any item you want, even the cheapest item in the game) -Cosmetic items are the only thing people seem to care about when it comes down to skill in-game  That is about all I can say"
"Fast, fun, gameplay for all. Nuff said."
overall pretty fun. Can be difficult at times but you just need to find the right class for you. 
"If you do not have this game, then you are a scrub lord and you need to get this game right now."
Holy shizzlew this is a good game
"God DAMN I'm glad that I actually used half an hour to play this game! This is the reason that I downloaded and installed. MvM is a genius gamemode. Well done, Valve! You may be trolls in certain situations, but this is more than a sorry present. 2007 is now one of my favourite years in history. I really recommend this game because of the stylish graphics and smooth gameplay, along with the amount of cosmetics and weapons for your 9 classes, Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Sniper, Medic and Spy. For starters, I'd use Pyro or Soldier. I still do now! Their personalities fill the game with epicness, along with the funny phrases and taunts (also Pyro's vision)! The best thing is... THAT THE GAME IS NOW FREE TO PLAY! Good luck, guys! I'll see you online! Well, some people would agree that having it Free to Play is their favourite thing, but it was mine when I first got steam."
This Game is Morely Awesome Even Gmod (I Dont Have Gmod But It Sounds Fun)
$5000 for a bunch of golden pixels?    I'm in.
Its a great game thats very different from most shooters. I recommend it.
Pros: - 3 dimensional Gameplay - Many servers and gamemodes - Hats - Taunts - The community - Community content - Many new players  Cons: - Hats - Taunts - Many NEW players - the community. - ugh. bonus ducks. i mean like... wow. Nice idea. - Maps which are too difficult for people who figured out how to fly around using bombs and rockets.
This is my life now
"Just get it, its free and it amazing"
This Game Is Good With w4m1 Pyros
Best Game Ever!!!  Go Try It NOWWWW!!!!!
"This is the best game in steam! Pls valve, do more updates!"
hat
TF2 is one of the most game changing games I ever played in my life. It also has a great strong community.
"420/10 game has broken hit boxes, worth the weight."
Noice Game
This Is A Review.
"Many of you know that there has been a decline when it comes to the first person shooter genre in video games. All they are now are linear maps that characters have minimal to no replay-ability value. Team Fortress 2 is honestly one of the best first person shooters of all time. It is one of the best for many reasons. People do not think that it is a genuine game due to its cartoonish look and no storyline in game. But I am here to prove you wrong.  Team Fortress 2 was made in the golden age for video games in 2007. Valve was releasing the best of the best that year and I feel as if TF2 is one of those under rated and under appreciated games. There are hundreds of different ways you can play in TF2. You can play from multitude of games and maps that where specifically built for that mode. You play whatever class you want and each have there own advantage and own style of play. Then you have the teams and the list just goes on and on. Hell, even community run servers are the best servers i have seen in any game. So many gamemodes and hundreds of more ways to look at TF2.  With hundreds of weapons and cosmetics, you can see why people play TF2 for years on end. There is so much replay value in the game and many ways to play the characters like a Demoknight or Medikrit. If you combine all of these and the great competitive community you can see why TF2 is so loved.  Valve constantly updates Team Fortress still ever since the day it was released. There have been good, bad, and disappointing but at least they try to keep the game relevant. Many updates come and go but the community plus the artwork, items, and movies that go with the updates make every update more exciting then the last.   In short, if you want a game you can spend ours playing and never get bored, i would play this game as you will always find another way to play it no matter how long you have been playing."
"You can get shot, burned, gibbed, panned, fanned, hammed, fished, eaten by pyro sharks in 2fort, dominate, get dominated, get revenge, get revenged on, be a F2P, become P2P, get hats, forget that your only hat is the Gibus, cri, get accused of hacking, get mocked by others, be a noob, headshot, bodyshot, get critical hits, get hit by a critical, go on a trade server, get scammed, scam the scammer, write reviews, realize that Gaben is almighty, praise him, buy hats, fork up your money, realize your broke, cri once more, play with friends, dominate your friends, now you have no friends, cri even more, yell into the mic, get yelled at via mic, troll, get trolled, get kicked, get banned, see a noob, kill said noob, noob is a little kid who has a squeaky voice, you now have no hearing.  11/10  It's wonderful"
The best game for me :).
I bought a hat. I bought more hats. Wasted 1000 hours on this game. Worth it.
I got kicked from MvM because i chose pyro   10/10 would get kicked again
"This Game Is About 9 Men Work Together,including *Bat*man(Scout),The Mr.Painis In The Cake(Soldier),The W+M1 Pro(Pyro),The Spammer(Demoman),Lazy Piece Of Cr@p(Heavy),The Genius That Get Kill everytime(Engineer),Hitler(Medic),The Camper Guy With A Camper Van(Sniper),And The Last One,The Spotter(Spy).

This has to be the best shooter ever. Either that or the most addictive one. Anyone who does not recommend this game is pure molten evil.
"You know your life's screwed when you choose to buy a hat instead of buying Skyrim.  Doesn't matter, at least you're not wearing a Gibus."
"Amzing free FPS, love every class. Dctr srsly trust fr reel cmon get it nw agn dctr trust do it NOOOOOOOOOWWW"
10/10 would always play this game again
"dis gaim is gud, 2 bad wen i leg, i dnot kno fi i ma eythre leggin, er i bummed in 2 a spi"
Luved dis game. awesome free and fun.
"In all the time that I've played this game I can say that I absolutely loathe, but at the same time love, this game. Whats this, you want to know how I came to that conclusion? Well here I'll give you a quick story:  Once upon a time a young player named KFC_Crusader opens TF2. He loves to play spy, so he continues on to a random map and gamemode. 'Oh boy, I sure do love spy!' exclaims the young KFC. He continues to customize his spy loadout for another 10 minutes until he is ready. 'Okay, now to suck snails and ♥♥♥♥ their women.' KFC says quietly. He immediately runs outside of the base and cloaks all while stalking for prey. Moments later the young KFC hears a man screaming 'Screaming Eagles!' 'Oh, no!' exclaims the young KFC. As KFC continues to sap the engi's toys as quick as he can he hears 'Maggots.' As his teammates fall to the man. Now done with the sapping and ready to make haste KFC runs as quick as the gingerbread man back to a safe haven. It is too late. His body turns to stone. He turns his head slowly as he sees the shadow above, the shadow of the man who wants his head. He leaps into the air quickly while chasing the now sprinting KFC. KFC is running for the dear life he was bestowed only to no avail as a wild rocket from the screwball in the air injures him. He is limp. He tries to crawl only to clutch the boot of his attacker. KFC watches as the man drinks a cup of coffee in front of him saying 'I love a good fresh cup of ♥♥♥ kicking in the morning' as he proceeds to dislodge a rocket into KFC's ♥♥♥. The young KFC....is now dead...  TL:DR basically I love this game, but the ducking soldiers just love to ♥♥♥♥ me over every time. I would recommend to anyone. Clearly a rocket---&gt; 8=D/10 would get bent over as spy and ♥♥♥♥♥ again."
"This game changed my life, it helped me get through some pretty dark times and still helps me to this day. It has it all, if you want to play it competitively you can (Despite MM needing some pretty serious fixes which I'm sure will happen), if you want to play it casually you can, or you can be like me and play crazy custom gamemodes just to relax and have fun without being too serious. Not to mention you don't have to pay a dime and still can get full enjoyement out of it. Or you can be like me and spend a lot of money on hats which I should feel ashamed for but I don't regret putting money into such a great game.   It has something for everyone. The community has a lot of awesome people in it, and there is so much to do it's overwhelming. I've played this game for almost 2000 hours which is ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous but I'm still going strong and still getting entertainment out of it.   No matter what happens to this game it will always have a place in my heart and I'll always get a certain amount of fun from it. I'd consider it my favorite game of all time. It's a 10/10 for me."
omg get it if u dont get it ur a scrub m8   im gonna go download the fem pyro mod now bye ;)
tf2 is the best game 
cool hats that it
:Gets game :Installs  :Gets Mecenary badge :Gets Gibus :Does Well :Buys Hats :Buys Hats :Gets a 100$ steam gift :Buys all the cool stuff :Gets Hacked :Says ♥♥♥♥ Steam :Joins back a year later :Finds out still has hats :Decides To buy more :Sticks to crit only because of rustyness :Learns Rocket Jumping :Writes Review :Jacks off
It's alright. Got bored pretty quick.
IT IS BEST GAME 10/10 IGN
Matchmaking? Come on bby don't hurt a classic.
Its a great game the community is very welcoming to new players and dedicated people on the competitive scene which made this game into what it is today and altogether makes this game so enjoyable and fun even after 8 years it is still such a wonderful game and i doubt not after picking up this game at least 50%of ur fren will have this awesome fun fps class based shooter
Team Fortress: Global Offensive
help. i've been playing this game for 5 years and i can't stop. i have kids to feed and my family is falling apart. ¯\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯
Wow this is the best game in the world 5 star ign rating noscope mlg doge
Nice Game. I Can't Wait For More Updates!!!
"I haven't played it enough to truly give a proper review, but I think I like it."
The only game where you can stop fighting the enemy and dance together.   &lt;3
"Slap on Dr. Seuss Hat, grab rocket launcher, Rapid fire shotgun, and garden Shovel.  Smack German Doctor in the face with shovel, Blow up 17 year old boy from Boston, Fire 6 shells into a fat Russian man.  After that I went home and played Team Fortress 2.  "
"10/10 First game i ever played on steam, thanks to a friend of mine. And cant stop playing it."
"  Best free to play FPS Game on steam, and it's also on xbox 360 which is even more epic  Team Fortess 2 is like a game everyone wants and if you dont think so, try asking some youtubers they'll give you your answer, TF2 on steam has mods, more then just default guns, more maps, and loads more!  TF2 can run on any computer above windows 7 sometimes windows vista if your just doing 1v1 bot gameplays or 2v2 bot gameplays, multiplayer 8v8 or 4v4 real life players on vista is super laggy.  If you have windows vista and you wish to play TF2 but without the lag do the 2v2 or 1v1 bot gameplays that will really help  This is the best Free to Play and the best First Person Shooter on steam out there."
  My inventory now cost more then my own soul  gg 10/10
1. get game 2. play pyro 3. stop playing pyro 4. play a good class 5. get a hat 6. learn that you can right click as pyro 7. start to play pyro again and miss a bunch of reflects 8. look up reflecting tips on youtube 9. give up pyro 10. repeat from step 4
Is this a new game?
Random crits are fair and balanced :D 10/10
10/10 would buy more hats
one of the best class baced shooters ever
"Why am I even writing this?  By the time you've read this thing, you've played 2000+ hours, gotten a million hats, and gotten every taunt/cosmetic possible  You already know how good this game is, it's obvious god dammit."
It's Fun
My first tf2 game goes on ctf server plays scout to test it walks out of spwan killed by demoknight changes to soldier fires rockets randomly kills everyone but demoknight runs out of ammo use shotgun demoknight kills me with 1 hp left rage quit changes server 10/10 would rage again 
this is the best hat simulator i've ever played
"Only fun the first 800 hours, then you get bad and throw everything around the room.  9.4/10 too much skill needed"
  This game is pretty swell. I wish Engineer said more than just 'yeehaw im southern'. 3/10
its a good game
is good game (im doing this for a badge)
Shooting
"Some times when you download a game, something sparks. Maybe love for the game. Maybe. But for me and tf2, it's different. It allowed me,        To be a fat guy with a mini gun."
Well its the best hat simulator out there so why don't try it out( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
It's Team Fortress 2. Need I say more?
Best ♥♥♥♥ing game I have ever played. There is so much to do here and the community is amazingly fun. :D
If you can't STAND high voices this isn't the game for you... But this game will get all your attention and dedication I would highly recommend it!
Great game
you can wear my sweatshirt
"I like to play TF2 because it is Tf2. it is no longer TF2. Wait times, ranks, and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t no one asked for. wtf valve"
just fix it and made a couple of tweaks  make the mathmaking much more faster and try to make this popular like having it attention in the e sports scene like a tf2 majors or something.... (thx for community servers saving my feeling about this game)  more popular=more ppl will play=faster matchmaking  but in this state right now the game is almost unplayable if youre trying to play in 'casul' mode (THERS A PENALTY IF YOU LEAVE A MATCH..A PENALTY!!!) and being stuck in community servers 24/7.
i joined my first game and was called a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for stealing a 7 year olds kill. 10/10 would play again
This game is pretty good.
"not a bad game, but i'm gonna be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and NOT recommend it.            btw im gonna expose Gaben as being a pedophile on DramaAlert"
A very nice game to have fun in. 
"After you play it for a while, you'll realize, you've already put in 100 hours, then 500 hours and even 1000 HOURS! It's that addictive! The 9 classes are easy to understand and play (except the spy), but hard to master. Here's a tip, before starting your first game of TF2, do the tutorial or you'll get tons of hate from the bad side of the community.  There's also hats...but those are just there to make your 9 classes unique, that's all!"
gets a headshot on an invis spy using mic. gets called a hacker. nearly gets vac'ed        9/11 would hack again
CRITS...
"this is one of my favourite games in steam. i love all the classes it has, i love it how each class have their personality. this is just so interesting to play XD"
"Hat Simulator 2: The Taunts' Rise is a very fun game to play, though at times due to framerate issues it can make the game a little annoying to play, but that is soley dependant on the users computer  10/10, would hat again"
"Great game. Nice graphics and a 'cartoony' style to it. Great game balance without any guns that can be unlocked by level. No that doesn't happen like in COD. You just unlock weapons by time. Sure some weapons can be extremely overpowered when used correctly or extremely underpowered, but i said 'when used correctly'. This means that TF2 takes skill which makes it balanced. Yes maybe some games there are very VERY good players, but trust me... You will get used to it. Just go click on servers and search up something like a uberupgrades server or a training map. For example, 'tr_walkway_rc2'. Here you can practice backstabs, trickstabs, airshots, and much more than you can think of. Overall, TF2 is a great and balanced game that you can play for a while without getting bored. Well, maybe... Such as 'Muselk' who has over 5,000 hours on TF2 and is really good, but to him its boring. So he made a youtube channel with all the crazy vlogs, games, and actions he does in those games.(Mostly TF2) So shoutout to Muselk and have a nice day gaming! Oh! One more thing that you should know. There are still glitches in TF2 and if that happens you can either enjoy it, leave the server, or report that glitch to Valve. These glitches include having the payload off-course, having a sentry built underground, having a sentry built on the skybox, and having control point locking issues. Well, bye bye i guess C:"
"This game isn't the best shooter around. It doesn't have amazing visuals, the community is both good and bad, and some might find it a bit lacking. But the game will run on a bad computer easily and smoothly, and it's free. It may not be comparable to a game like Overwatch or CS:GO, but it's the king of both shooters that can run on potatoes and free-to-play games. There are some great members of the community, but there is a small percentage of the community that will go out of their way to complain in voice chat and ruin the game for others. Overall, this game isn't a game built to compete with games like Battlefield or Arma. It's not going to be a groundbreaking shooter. But if you're new to Steam, download it. It's a pretty fun game, and it's free!"
10/10 worth getting for the lulz
"Don't trust those negative reviews about the Meet-Your-Match Update. All, and I mean ALL of the problems Meet-Your-Match brought are patched right now. Props to the TF2 team for listening to the community Team Fortress 2 is and will be my number 1 game in my steam library, it's fun, challenging and free, so go get it now!"
"Very fun worth the 6 hour wait and endless fun with lots of maps and wepons, I blew almost $50 on this game in 1 day and do I regret it from this day? No. I give this game 11/10 much more different from basic FPS's such as CoD, MW, DOOM, etc Might be a little frustraiting at first to all you hardcore CoD fans but when you practice you get really good. I think you and your friends should get this game the best part is it's free!"
"Highly under-rated competitive game, way better than CS:GO if you're looking for a game that actually requires brain usage."
this gaem is really coool i like it a lot and i sugest it to everyone !
Im bad at it. People 5 years younger than me violated me verbably.  11/10 *clap clap clap*
"Best game evar, it taught me the true value of a hat."
Nah not my game for little 12 year olds. I never really liked it just it is super uneven out and no more updates so nope....... not for me
"That's good, amen.        Really, play it ._:"
if you get into the storyline it will keep you playing for years to come
"Team Fortress 2 in my opinion is an amazing game. The vast variety of weapons and cosmetics make it difficult for me to make a class that looks and plays well (In a good way). The characters all have their own personalities from different locations like Medic from Germany and Heavy from Russia which makes all of them unique in their own way. The multiple amount of taunts drains my wallet so fast I'll end up in a bad apartment with a laptap, mouse, and router. Unboxing items gets me so hyped to get an unusual but then getting a regular item instead. The crafting system is also unique in which I can use things to craft metal, then turn that metal into better metal, then that better metal into even better metal, and then make a hat or tons of weapons. This game hits everything I want in a good game such as this. TF2 is full of life and too many spies that I find myself going online over and over burning those silly little spies in my nice coat &gt;:D"
"Team fortress 2 is a fun fps which is free in most games you buy hats or cosmetics to get extra health/armor or any other effects, in tf2 it doesnt have any stats, weapons are accesable through trading, finding or buying and so are the hats. This is a fun game and i really enjoy it! Its awesome !"
"Team Fortress 2  WAS  a good game, before the community ruined it. Multiplayer is incredibly far from enjoyable, as everyone who plays it regularly now is really bad... making the game frustrating. Team plays are non-existent. Stay far way."
Can be enjoyable for hundreds of hours
"This is the reason I have a vitamin D deficiency and an empty steam wallet. But it's all good, because it's too good. I think I even learned something about teamwork along the way.  Overall a little ray of sunshine in our miserable lives spent in the darkness of the void. GG Valve.     "
"#1 War Themed Hat Simulator Game  You have 9 classes to choose from in this game, multiple weapons with stats, some reskinned but look cool, and hats that can express your personality. There are multiple events and game modes, capture the flag, control points, ect. There's also a Co-op gamemode that's called Mann vs Machine, there's Boot Camp where you can play with players for free, but in Mann Up Mode, you get loot everytime you complete all of the challenges in each Tour, especially Tale Of Two Cities where you get Killstreak, Specialized Killstreak Fabricators, and/or Professional Killstreak Fabricators, and a rare chance of getting an Australium Weapon"

team fortress 2 is a fantastic game 
I have been played this game for almost 2 years and i still love every second
"A fun game, and lots of hats. If ur new, there might be trouble starting out, but in the end, youll be happy."
This game is great! All of my friends love it.
 Team Fortress 2 : Hat simulator 
Best Game In The Universe! I Suggest You To Download It
10/10
10/10 Best Game I Ever Played....
"While yes, this game is quite old (not quite as old as RuneScape). It still has a pretty active community, and a reallhy nice community. 10/10 all around great game"
heeey thats pretty good
once a good game (:  not anymore :(
It's a classic FPS. Tons upon tons of replayability. But the problem is that you're going to get called a loser and autistic if you don't have non-achievement / Event cosmetics.
"TF2 is approaching its 10th birthday and its been a wild 10 years. This games development has been a rollercoaster of ups and downs and at this point for me it just isnt fun anymore. The community is a shallow husk of what it used to be, and quality community servers are very few these days. Playing tf2 is like playing call of duty, you going to play against people you've never met before and after you leave the server you'll probably never see them again. As for hats and stuff, that was a fun gambit back in the day but these days the economy has crashed hard and it is very difficult to build up a collection of valuable stuff from scratch without having to spend real money on keys or a hat first to start trading up. Some people like it but it just isn't what it used to be."
- Got rid of pubs - Only competative and less competative - No more quickplay - ♥♥♥♥ this game
Bad. New update just lets kids lobby together to guarantee easy pocket medic gameplay to steamroll servers. Tired of getting matched with noobs when I have 2k hours in this game. I don't lobby with people so I'm at an instant disadvantage.
Nice game but hard
"This game is great for your health! Just log on, and, in a few hours, you'll be hooked. After a certain amount of time, you'll find out the game GIVES you things for playing. It's good for your health because I played it for a week straight and forgot to eat. Overall, it's the 2nd best weight loss game on Steam"
I'm doing this for the badge
"10/10  I used to have a life, and disposable income. Then I found this game."
"It's pretty okay I guess. Do I really have to describe it? Pretty much everyone on steam knows what tf2 is. So like, go play it already, or don't, your choice."
"Here comes the money, here comes the money, money money money money money. Dolla dolla ching ching  In other words, ♥♥♥♥ updates, ♥♥♥♥ community"
This updata justed ruin my life ;-;
Still the best war themed hat simulator. The recent MYM update fixed a bug where players could form a community around the game and have fun. Looking to trade matchmaking ticket for pre-MYM update TF2.
"Sometimes games can be hard for you, and very hard to get a few kills but once you get used it, you will probably love it and the classes have different tactics to play with, this game has so many different game modes which is every classes are important for team."
The games amazing everone knows it. Play it now.
Great shooter with a lot of variety  Lots of weapons Lots of classes Lots of game modes Free to play - no reason not to try it
"Meet your match update... The teams are unbalanced you mostly end up with 4 players vs 10 or 12 players.Time to time this is the only thing I don't like about this update. The game is good,fun and also amazing but this update.I hope it makes some changes."
"As of writing this I only have 600 hours. However over those past 600 hours of playing I have gained quite a through knowledge of the gameplay, community, economy etc which that tf2 possesses. Whilst there have been several updates that continue to drive that decreasing community away from the game, with 'Meet your Match' only making this worse. It is impossible to deny that this games has an amazing legacy and tale that so many games can't compete with. Overall I personally continue to play this game, because of how brilliant it is to me. Either if it's the weapons, taunts, characters, HATS, comics or just the great community that has stuck around after all these years. tf2 has still been able to attract new people everyday. I hope that in return for the community that has made tf2... well tf2. Valve can start to improve some of the things that are driving people away. To some up my review I would definitely, any day tell my friends to play this game. It's a yes from me."
this is cool men
this is a fun game
This game is my favorite the end.
I could literally spend weeks playing this game. the only reason I'm writing this review is for an achievement ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"Great Game, has a few broken weapons and valve is slowly updating TF2 for the better. After many years of dark slow years of Valve not communicating with us, Valve changed there ways. Although Valve has many things on improving on it will be a great expierence in the future"
If anyone can see this the latest update has made the game a ♥♥♥♥ show and you shouldn't play this unless you like nunbalanced games unfair teams and games were you never win. I used to like this game but now it is a ♥♥♥♥ game thanks to valves update!
"tf2 is like a baby its awesome at first, but then it gets boring and more boring until you realize youre spending $300 a month on it and cant stop  i love it"
"It's alright.    I guess, i wouldn't know."
"Really, all I have to say is, Tf2 is an awesome game. If you don't like the violence, you can also take that out. This game is by far my most favorite game, ever. period."
"For the first time ever, I have been so addicted to an FPS shooter game. Yet, this game has still so much potential to proceed on. I recommend playing it, it can not limit people's skill in the game (F2Ps and Premium Members). Whether you like spending money on F2P games or not, you can still be able to be a good player (Probably not fashion wise though)."
it is extremly fun and free just get it ffs
remove that ♥♥♥♥ing deserter penalty
It's a noice game
You will cumsplode your pants off when you see this game
THIS GAME IS AWESOME BUY IT (and the millions of other hats u will cry for)
"Not sure what's worse, the 'improved' game or the playerbase."
Both the original and rip off are the same ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Best game in the world!
"This game, If not careful will steal the life right from your eyes"
TF2 Is a brilliant game. A really good first-person shooter. If you were looking for a good gun game TF2 would be the 1 for you!
"Team Fortress 2 is one of my favorite games OF ALL TIME. There are TONS of different weapons. And if you get the same weapon, you can trade it for another. No match is ever the same, and neither are the servers. Halloween events are amazing, maps and weapons are added almost monthly, and one more thing. HATS. ALL OF THE HATS. If you don't have at least a Ghostly Gibis, you don't deserve to be playing this game. I can play for hours straight and never get bored. If you are new to Steam, or an experienced gamer, I would recommend this game to everyone who enjoys a unique game, or just a good old FPS game. Valve, you've really outdone yourselves again."
"Hello fellow steam uses Killin here. team fortress 2 has what toy story 3 was missing fast action pack orgys of violence. You can also play dress-up in the middle of a intense fire fight. Team fortress 2 also has a large variety of Hats, weapons, Taunts, and cosmetic. But the best part about team fortress 2 is that its FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE SO get it now for action pack orgys ."
EGAD WHAT A FUN GAME!
Yes please.
"a game where hats are worth more than a minigun, and where you can buy a hat that costs more than an irl hat  ggnore"
The game is a little hard at first but once you get use to the basics it gets easy and fun! Trust me when I say the hats will give you more skill.
 One of the best games i ever played
This game is very interesting.I like this game
"LeMe : You think this story's gonna have a happy ending ? TF2 : Happy endings are just stories that haven't finished yet.  :feels:  Goodbye, TF2.  *heading to Overwatch*"
"Good thing it's on sale for $0.00 today, man I would have paid $19.99 on this game if it weren't for the sale, Thanks Valve!!"
What the hell is a Medi Gun ???
One of the bestest (I use bestest because it surpasses best) game I have ever played. The updates always suprise me. Don't believe me? Try for yourself. Good luck and have fun. ;)
Best Game I´ve ever played!
I love this game!
I really Like this game. It is packed with fun
"I can't guarantee this to be a good review. But I can guarantee you that this game will take all of your money the second you launch it, and this is coming from a person who hasn't spent a dime on game cosmetics until Team Fortress 2 came along. Today, I have no dimes."
"Jon Arbuckle couldn’t believe his eyes. The man who had once been his cat now stood before him, passionately eyeing his owner as he flexed his giant muscles. The operation to transform Garfield into a full blown human being had cost a lot of money, but deep down, Jon knew it was worth it. Every string he had had to pull to make this possible, every penny of loans he had taken out, every late hour spent working for the sake of a few more dollars of pay, all of those sacrifices paled in comparison to the euphoria that now coursed through his being knowing that this beautiful man was forever his. He had promised himself he’d stay composed, but even now he felt tears of joy flood his eyes and flow down his face. Jon collapsed to his knees, overcome by emotion.  “Jon,” he heard Garfield call out. “Please don’t cry, Jon.” Jon felt a firm, chiseled hand clasp his shoulder and looked up. The beaming, masculine face of his former housepet and new human companion looked back at him, seeming to radiate an amiable warmness that practically made Jon melt in contentment. Garfield’s sturdy jaw and defined cheeks created a paragon of handsomeness unlike any that Jon had ever seen before. Gone was his beer gut and gluttony, and before him was a new man, one that Jon knew he would love for the rest of his life. “I’m here now, Jon,” Garfield whispered. “I’m here all for you.”  “Oh Garfield,” Jon moaned in delight, and the two men’s lips met in a passionate kiss, the first of many more to come between the new couple."
"In a game with sentry guns, laser pistols, high-powered sniper rifles, miniguns and rocket launchers, the guy running around with a sheild, boots and a sword is the most over-powered guy in the game.   10/10"
[insert generic 'it's okay' review]  
Shopping for hats has never been easier.
"Sorry, what's a social life? Doesn't matter, I'm trying to get an unusual "
"27/10 Great game, fun mechanics, interesting community, thriving economy, free to play with no paywalls besides more inventory space and access to trading, and hats. Gibus is best hats. Hats that are on fire cost more than hats that have satanic rituals above them. Don't get scammed, kids."
"I played it for a little bit. It's ok, i guess.  By a bit i mean over 6000 hours, and by ok i mean freakin' amazing."
Played this a fair amount on another account and its decent.  1. Learn the basics of the game 2. Open cases but have no luck 3. Spend your weekly allowance on keys instead of rent 4. Save enough for a sexy flaming hat 5. Get all the e-♥♥♥♥♥es that are really just men 6. Focus the hats energy and compete in UGC Platinum 7. Win some comps but realise you have 5k hours on the game 8. Discover your name is Joe Wall  Enjoy the game.
its a good game 
Demoman takes alot of skill.
TF2 a game suited for all if ure new at this game dont worry u will get better trust me. weapons hats mannco the comics on e of the best game ive ever seen
"This game has made me waist more money than anything else I've ever owned, that includes my car."
This game is a great fashion simulator. 8/8 - IGN
"I would recomend this to anyone who loves first person shooters, but prefers a bit more comical version"
I can set people on fire and that is nice.
"I go as friendly hoovie and throw people sandviches. Noobs kill me. I rage and make their souls into sandviches.  ∞/10, would make souls into delicious sandviches again"
"I don't know why, but I just keep coming back to this game even when I say I will quit tf2."
"It truely is a great game, but it will kill your wallet if you get into the hats and other cosmetic items and don't know how to stop buying those damn hats.  8/10"
I now have a burning hate for Pink and Lime. 5/7.  (joke aside 10/10)
Best hat simulator on the market And it's FREE! There is no reason not to get this game! It is really fun and you can run it on a potato attached to a toaster!
"Basically the best hat simulator I've found so far, also with the feature to kill people who's fashion taste you don't like."
"If i could stop playing this game, i would. But i cant. Because its addicting."
Like that game modes 
Valve Logic Finds way to incorporate unusual weapons in TF2. Still hasn't released HL3.
"I have never once played a game that is so great that you can have two opposing teams of 20 people all pretending to be riding a broomstick at the same time. 10/10 would broomstick again  Pros: Hilarious gameplay Hours of entertainment Great community Multitude of classes Complex trading system Item pickup system that keeps you playing forever Easy multiplayer  Cons: Still haven't learnt Japanese I have become a myth in my household Never learnt to play the violin  basically, I reccomende this game to you, your aunt, your father, your father's aunt, your aunt's dog, your dog's father, and your second cousin twice removed."
It's kinda good I guess...
Pootis. Thats all i'm gonna say.

"so i had written a very passionate essay about this game and what the devs have done wrong in recent update but it was mysteriously deleted along with my animosity. Tough break was a ♥♥♥♥ show and we all know it; the supposed 'response update to overwatch' ripped off overwatch worse than they did to us and had none of the feautes.  but praise gaben i dont have to go over the list of issue because, get this, THEY LISTEN! good on you valve finnaly doing something right. Casual is looking better than ever and I have a lot more faith in the future of this game than i did 5 months ago.  in conclusion play this game"
pootis bird thinks you should play this game
"*every update adds cosmetics that don't even look good 90% of the time *every update completely changes weapons in odd and useless ways (Except pyro, always buff pyro) *Needlessly nerf classes that need buffs and needlessly buff pyro when pyro needs to be nerfed *keys keys keys keys keys keys keys keys keys keys keys keys keys keys *want to participate in the new cool update? Please pay us *did you like that one class that you did well in? let's update and 'balence' it *wanna try and get a cool golden gun? pay us 4$ for a chance  *looking forward to a well balenced in game economy and trade system? keep looking *at least its a free download"
"So ok tf2 is this game that a lot of cats seem hella pumped of. and this game is sitting in my library and i'm told to review it, so i'm like, yeah man ill write something.  but i dont know is this about castles or some noise? that's fine I'm sure that's like ♥♥♥♥ing dynamite in a handbag for some brosephs. but all i'm saying is when to youget to bust out some mad stunts? while your playing castle or some ♥♥♥♥ are you ever in danger of getting wheel marks on your tower walls from busting out, and I quote, 'the mad stunts all wicked up-ins'?  Know what I,m saying bro-yo ma? i didnt actually play this game but i gave it 1.5 out of 5 hats to keep it real.  At this point i,d like to give a shoutout to my boy Dennis who was over the other day. We whaere going to chill in front of the dark knight and he was so psyched of it y'all.  So this one time he was leaning against the screen door and the ♥♥♥♥ popped open and the back deck was wet and he slipped down the steps and broke his thumb on the lawn. it wasnt a long fall but hey i guess a umb bone wasnt made for supporting the brunt of a huge useless tool against wet grass. we never did watch Dark Knight on account of ron trucking his bawling candy-♥♥♥ girth to the hospital. but its cool i still got another watch in me Brotel Rawanda.  bro-notes:Dennis was so wasred man, haha. i mean damn."
"Ok let's get this straight, I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE THIS GAME, But something caught my attention, can you guess what? THE ♥♥♥♥ING PHLOG, It is so broken and it made me almost, almost quit the game when i saw it. Everytime i get dominated by someone using it, I quit the game and then i just go downstairs and smoke and live my life as i should do it but TF2 is such a big part of my life so i can't quit it. if you see this. DON'T AND I REPEAT DON'T play this game unless you are one of those who like being killed with the most op weapon in this game."
its EPIC!! definitely one of the epicest games out there!
best free to play game on steam no doubt about it.
  Would get killed by a random crit again.  10/10
Who doesn't like this game ???

"Hat sim+Counterstrike+Classes+Fun Community+Plztakemymoneygaben=tf2 .06/10 it isnt even that gud  actually is gud, but who gets the reference?"
"Team Fortress 2: a game that needs no introduction. Pretty much if FPS are your favorite kind of games, then you will absolutely enjoy this game. The hackers are annoying, but Valve does a great job preventing them. This is a game you and your friends will enjoy."
The best game I ever played.
Can annoy p2ps  10/10
Hat Fortress 2 Gun Mettle edition is a great social simulator geared towards those willing to throw their life savings at their computer screen for hats and other cosmetics. occasionally you get to shoot a gun apparently but this was nerfed in the new update to where it is changed to russian dancing in hordes in hope your foes are too confused to attack. Such tactics are adapted by each class e.g. the spy using a box to hide from enemy engineer's serverside aimbot contraptions. However there is one hat everyone in this simulator strives for known as 'The Gibus'. This Godly hat is said to have been touched by Gabe N. himself and will grant the wearer infinite fame. In fact this hat has been nerfed by Valve for being too powerful. In attempt to hide the true hat they created a bunch of fakes that they gave to all new players to cover their shiny bald heads and hoped that would cover up the one true gibus. To this day players are still searching for the Gibus and the prophecy of Dustbowl has it that one day a player known as 'The Hatborn Shpee-ahkiin' will be born into the world of Hat Fortress 2 and will posses the power to locate the ancient Gibus and unlock the potent energy within the artifact. But until that day we wait fellows and pray that the unusuals will suffice in protecting us from certain F2P doom.
"played for a couple of minutes, its ok"
"Great fastpasted FPS, although slightly unreal. Takes 3 headshots to kill an overhealed heavy with a sniper rifle! WTH!"
Amazing game offers diversity and fun!
Took all my money and my dignity. 10/10
I love this game its so funny and random and it makes you always laugh when theirs something random altogether this game is great for just messing around with friends.Also i recommened this game to all people because 1. Theirs so many choices and 2. You can still try to competive but you won't earn anything. 3. ITS FREE AND ITS DOESN'T SUCK :P So their you go thats my review
"I have proudly played 222.8 hourse of Team Fortress 2,And to be honest i don't regret a thing about it. This game is perfect if you're looking for a querky yet charming First person shooter, that will hook you in the first 20 mins of playing. Some things that this game did well, i will go into more detail near the end (This is my point of view, not every one will agree with what i have to say)    Easy to get into   Character selection and customisation   Iteam drops   crate unboxing (gilty plesure)   Trading system (sometimes goes down for mantinence)   Great community     Geting into it"
I opened the game and played as a blind WWII veteran who suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and takes his frustration out by blowing people up with an RPG and wearing sparkling hats.  Recommend.
"Funny, beautiful and good game! TF2 is nice timekiller!"
"I haven't play it that much, but its alright."
"I got humped by a sniper and insulted by a spy. 10/10 will continue playing for another 100 hours, and then another, and another.  It's addictive being a drunken scottish cyclops."
This is honestly one of the best games ever.
Ive Played This Game For So Many Hours... I Dont Think A Review Is Needed.
do it for the children  
Even better with mods...
Conga will help you through all of your problems. Lol     100/10
Great game (best review ever)
"My TF2 Story  First game= joins x10.... tells friends this is a crazy spastic game 2 years later=joins payload... tells friends best game ever Now= wasting money on hats, tuants, wepons and skins.......  I am going to die to this game.......I life dots..........lol   11/10 Gaben has done it Again"
"Great game to kill time and loose your stress. It's as good for casual players as for serious players since it has many playful and fun to play classes, which mastering requires years of your lifetime near your monitor and some good PC hardware. It's one of the most time-consuming and addictive games. Screw that boring counter-strike where you only have few weapons to use and no class to choose. The real fun is here, in Team Fortress 2."
"Hat simulator 2011 11/10, would love to wear hats again.(srsly best game ever)"
"Team fortress 2 was my number one game for me,it was the one to bring me where I am today,Thanks to valve and just keep at the good work :)"
Litterally everything in a orange box. Idk what better bargin you can find. It also has a sandwitch simulator
I only played a little bit.
If you have any doubts about it or heard anything bad about it (except for the lack of unusual drops ;-;) this game is UNDOUBTEDLY the greatest :3
"It's complete and utter trash if you put money in to this game, yet amazing if you have two wonderful misc's being the Gibus and Pyrovision Goggles."
This is a game that make me USE A LOT OF MONEY . But I still playing it .
The best things about tf2 youl proberly never get bored with it there is so many things you can practice master   for example you can be a trader : get weapones sell them for 1 scrap each like a weapone trader or be more advance   average trader : have hats or tickets or keys you can sell to people for refined and other stuff or be a full on trader like a  high tier trader : trade high tier unusuals australiums   or you could train your skills or have fun with friends there are so many random things that can happen in tf2  jumper : learn to train your rocket jumps sticky bomb jumps sentry jump and master them like many people  surfer : learn to surf and perfect the skill of strafing   there are so many other things you can do that i wont explain now so go on out play tf2  11 sandviches out of 10
Really awesome game :D
This game is very fun!!!
"The most top and well known F2P FPS games in history, with some crazy updates happening, its very fun to play with non-stop, to all haters i say one word - ♥♥♥♥ you"
"860+ hours   No hat drops No action loadout drops No life No more studies 1 Paint [Ye Olde Rustic Colour]   This game ruined me, but it was good."
um i think that they got the game name wrong it's team fortress global offensive 2 not team fortress 2 sorry gaben don't take my account D;
"+rep good game. 2 good 4 f2p, f2p-p2p-p2w omg 2 much epic kill 4 ya! so mlg np m8. p.s. this is m9 now!"
"Download the game, Get a Ghostly Gibus and pyrovision, Weapons drop, Start to pay for Stranges and Killstreak weapons, Trades everyday, Start to become rich, Get aussie weapons and unusual hat, Get onto a random pub, Show off  TF2 L i f e"
This is a state of the art and highly sophisticated hat simulator. Also there's a multiplayer first-person shooter element but I didn't pay much attention to that.
Goodbye personal life Goodbye friends Hello virtual hats
More bugs than a homeless shelter. 10/10
"I was not so sure about this game, but when i started playing it. I found it is a realy good game. it is probaly my favorite game at the moment i cant stop playing. i recomend this game if you like low violence first person shooters. the game consists of 9 classes scout, soldier, pyro, demoman, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper and spy. all the classes have their own set of weapons from long range snipers to melee knives. their are also 3 class roles which the 9 classes go into. their is Offensive, Defensive and Support. over all this is a great fun game to play"
Good game. I love hats.
Team Fortress 2 is a game for those learning to play first person shooter games or a game to just kick back and relax its not a game for people to like be try hards on because its litterly reallly hard to be a try hard on a amazing game that doesnt allow you to get tense up on i mean theres diffrent classes with diffrent personalities that will speak and act along your side 100% of the way happy blowing crap up :) :) :)

"This might be hard to believe, but this man is the leader of a group of lizards from the hyper elite. I know this first hand. I took care of this being as the mentor, as I am a hyper elite of the syntax-sector of the Illuminati. I have experimented with teleportation, Obama, and lizards shape-shifting into Secret-service agents. When the syntax-sector of the hyper elite barracks in the north pole, most experiments broke loose. This prototype, however, was smarter than most. With little to no signs of lizard-like structures when shape-shifted, he was the perfect man for our job. I once used my transformation powers, but was quickly spotted, and the extra-molecular shape-shifting superdinosaur came and saved me, with the hyperbeam harvested from Dialga in the Pokemon dimension. Yes, that show is real, made by the Ancient Gods from Sector-B//AnimationDimension//X-3, we transported the creatures into the 'intelligent' planet called Earth, in my opinion, the weakest sector of the whole Illuminati. If you want more information about these creatures first hand, contact me via Google+ or teleportating to the hyperdimension in Class-A."
"Tf2. Man where can i start. The way tf2 is created and the many characters you can pick, just makes the game very great and fun to play. The many other aspects are trading, witch can help you with bainking and employment skills. I want to say, to you all lookiin at this is to not be afraid to try it out. You may encounter better people, but whoes to stop you from getting better?  "
This game is full of action and is very entertaining
This game is really fun and great to play!  If you want a awesome game to play and you dont have money well then this is the game for you! The game has much weapons you can get without paying! Even tho you have to pay to get hats and clothing its still awesome because they dont really mean anything but looking cool!  I really recommend Team Fortress 2 for everyone!
This game is very fun! If you don't want to pay for a game you can play this! :)
"Summary: If I had to summarize Tf2 in one sentence, I'd say it's one of the most entertaining, balanced, and relaxing games to play.   Pros: From the moment I laid my eyes on this game a year ago, I literally haven't played any other game besides it. The 3 things that seprate it from all the FPS games out there are it's:  1. Great community  The Tf2 community is very friendly, and you can always find people to play with and hang out with on servers, from group hosted events to just chilling out with your friends.  2. Balanced classes  The balance between classes is another thing that makes this game the way it is. There is a counter for pretty much any weapon, so it's a battle of skill and prediction.   3. Everlasting entertainment   It's almost impossible to get bored of this game because of the hundreds of weapons and styles to play each class that exist, from trolling engies to tryhard soldiers to spawncamping demos. There's also hundreds of maps and gamemodes to play as well, so the fun never ends.  Cons: Error, not found.  Rating: All in all, hugely recommended for any experienced or new gamers. Try it out, and I guarantee you won't be dissapointed! 10/10  Edit: Hats make you a pro at this game."
"This game used to be fun. Nowadays, whenever I enter a casual game, it's a stomp. It's always one-sided with one team rolling over the other completely. Whether I'm on the winning team or not doesn't even matter, the games are way too short to be enjoyable. And Valve refuses to implement any kind of balancing system, they listened to the whiners and removed auto-balance completely instead of improving what was already there. So now we have this. A game that is simply no longer fun. I'm deleting it and I have zero intention of installing it again in the future. In fact I think I won't buy another Valve game again, period."
"To start this off, I need to find more games. I've spent now around 400 hours on TF2 finding it in August of last year. But knowing that, I play a varity of games but I play TF2 by far, the most. I would say it is a pretty good game that takes skill and timing to completely master. And to master every class might just take an eternity. I like the fact that there are community made maps, that most of the major updates are community based, and that there are different weapons relating to a range of things, from SFM's to other games."
I like this game :D  Never got bored :o
This game is unlike any FPS I have ever played. I have noticed while playing the game there is a lot of strategy in this unlike most FPS games. All classes have a weakness and there is a lot of 'teamwork' involved. You may be saying 'Teamwork! In an FPS you must be joking' see for yourself in this fantastic FPS created by none other than Valve.
"Its very nice for a free game. Because the graphics aren't insane, it can also run pretty well on older or weaker computers. Try it out."
Addicting in so many ways. Definitely reccomend checking out a prop hunt server for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles.
Played a bit. Was aight. Wish I had more time to play it though.
This game has become 50% of my free time.
I reccomend to play it....

sadly this game has gone down hill over the years its not that bad buts it sucks compared to the 2008-2012 years of it
it is a good game 
"Awwyeeaah, first place ♥♥♥♥♥es!"
Really good FPS without a doubt.
"Tf2 is the best effin game even mah duudes. I pesanally likescoot becoz he like sanik XDDDDDDDDD!!! I realy wish that Miss Pauling was a class because she is a hot effin B. In real life, i pretend im the scoot and like roleplaying as tf2 mercs. I like pretending that my friend is miss pauling and fake making out with her and saying 'oh yeah Miss Pauling'."
Great Game! 
"EDIT: So i decided to give TF2 another go, it was fine a some time ago but after the meet your match update came in place the game gotten worse and i was deeply disappointed with it, so i had to slap it a negative review, i really didn't like doing this since TF2 is one of my favorite games, but i had to, yesterday i tried it out to see if it changed and it did more or less, its not perfect but its playable again, im leaving my original review below.  *******************************  Team Fortress 2 is one of my favourite Free To Play games, it is has funny humour, very fun and engaging gameplay, really interesting characters/classes and there is a class for everyone, you want to be a heavy weapons guy? Play as the Russian Heavy. You are more of a supportive role? Then play as the German Medic or the Texas Engineer.   Team Fortress 2 was released in 2007 and it is still one of the most played games on Steam. Valve are supporting the game even up to today, with community made mods coming as a free update into the game, new weapons and hats and even cosmetics are being added into the game, except that I don’t have any since a single hat is like £5. Sorry bro, no buy for me. ;-;  Each class feels unique and very different from each other, if you’re the kind of guy that likes to run super-fast and use a shotgun up close, then the Scout is for you. If you like to take your targets from far range then the Sniper is for you. There is many gamemodes and maps. There is gamemodes like Payload (My favourite) where you push a bomb cart to the enemy base while the defending team has to well defend it, it seems simple but it is very and I mean very fun to play. There is also a gamemode called control points, where it is very similar to Payload except that you have to capture a control point in order to be able to advance, hence the name. The maps are all very unique, there is Cliff maps, Castles, Factory’s and many many more.  The characters in the game have a very good humour, there say funny lines, they comment on your kill, they comment when another player is healing you, it’s really great and it will put a smile on your face.  If you’re the kind of guy who doesn’t like to spend too much money in the Man Co Store then you can just keep playing and randomly you will eventually get an item, it will always be a weapon, it is random and it is going to be for any of the 9 classes but it’s still a free item, or you can go to the Steam market and buy the weapons cheaper and other items much cheaper.  Me and Team Fortress 2 have a very long history, it was the first multiplayer game that I was trying soooo hard to find on the PC and when I found out it was free to play on Steam I had to get it instantly, back then on my very old PC with a GTX 550 and an Intel Pentium I would play this game all day nonstop, it was the best multiplayer game I had and it still is one of my favourite games.  Download it and give it a go if you are looking for a different multiplayer game to play and have some fun."
Welp thats 2000 hours im not getting back.
"It be gr8 m8, I r8 8/8. pls no h8"
Best Free to Play game :3

its a good game m8   its free with paid addons and yea.
I just tried this game for a little while. it's ok. I guess.
"New updates for me in the game at all do not comply.The earlier version was more clearer than this new.This straight I can go play Counter Strike or Overwatch.Now, for me there are missing maps that you previously were.The game with NEW UPDATES, I do not recommend.Only when it can be back."
Nice and Fun game! You wanna play this Game! Because Its all about 2 Teams Fighting against each other! Theres different Gamemodes too! PLAY THIS GAME NOW &lt;3
This game is all what a class based shooter should be.It has costumizeable weaons gamemodes and even a comptetive scene that works even though you may have to pay for it this is one of my favorite games on steam
That the best action game ever!
"I hate this game as much as I love it, and that's a lot."
1 - Wait 15 minutes to join a game in Casual 2 - Finally join a match 3 - Wait 3 seconds to spawn 4 - End of the match 5 - Repeat XXX - Profit !
Great game and very addictive!
This game has hats! Lots of hats! HHHHNNNNGG!
New update completely ruined the game I once loved
"TF2 is really easy to understand and have fun. Within the hour, you'll be able to play it with ease. Te tutorial is very useful and the controls are simple"
Be sure not Buy alot of things from store although it is the BEST VALVE FPS EVER
'Tries to kill someone with rocket jumper' 'WHY ARNT U DED?! OMG!!!! UR USIN HACKS!!!!'  'Sees enemy Demoman sticky jump across map' '♥♥♥♥ING NOCLIP HACKER'  10/10 Would play for 1000+ hours. 
hats.
Best tf2 was 2012-2014 now it isnt what it once was.
Best hat simulator and ducks.
A really good game m8! FPS + Hat simulator = TF2
"Can't get out of the start menu, Send help."
How can you leave the server when that reserve shooter ♥♥♥♥♥ with a medic up his ♥♥♥ is still dominating you?? (The “Just 5 More Minutes” Award)
Probably one of the best games games Valve has created. Still hitbox's are broken
"Valve has outdone theirselves with this masterpeice of a game with many patches and major updates throughout the years since its initial release. I would recommend if you are looking for a game that let's you run down people, blow up people, burn people, explode people, gun down people, defend people, heal people, snipe people, or stab people."
A timeless classic.
the best game ever
it's ok
"The game isn't dead, just give it a try...  pretty fun to play with friends and have a goofy time"
"TF2 is like a bandit, it'll ask for your 'money or your life' then take both anyway."
Send hats please I need them
"Just like Hat Sim 1, but with an FPS minigame.  10/10"
great game
It's free
I just want that badge.
11/10 would not remove the news of a 'recent' update in their game's description.
"TF2 (or Team Fortress 2) is an FPS that has 9 different classes (Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy). Each of these classes has its own special weapn and/or action. For example: Pyro: Action = moves at normal speed single jump. Weapon = Flamethrower Scout: Action = moves twice as fast as normal speed and has double jump. Weabon = Scattergun As you can see these are just a couple of classes but all of them have different traits. I would highly recommend this game to people who might be new to the gaming world."
Nominated for the 'Test of Time' award :)
Still good.
Its like someone activated the Yu-Gi-Oh card 'toon town' in a counter strike game.
its ok lol
love this game one of the best get this game because if u dont you wont get your trusty steam experince
Simply the best game created. Case closed. Hail lord Gaben! It is as fun today as it was when i started playing it. I now have 1 000+ hours on the game.
gets boring after playing 100 hours c; Loveit ... just play csgo
"One of the best 'Class based FPS shooter ever,maybe one of the best since 2008'"
YOU GET AN UNUSUAL! AND YOU GET AN UNUSUAL? TAUNTS? UNUSUAL! HATS? UNUSUAL! SKINS? WHY THE F*CK NOT?
I only kill demoman.     because he's black   
"Cool, and nice."
Best war themed hat simulator i've ever played. 10/10
"This game is a true legend.  If you see, was released on Oct 2007 and so many people (including me) still play this game, because it's fun, addicting and good to invite friends to pwn the other team.  Still today I was never learned how to rocket jump, but it's just a detail.  Live long for Team Fortress 2, the game will be complete 10 years in 2017 and still playable and give lots of epic moments and fun."
"  What makes Team Fortress 2 such an addicting game?      Could it be the players? The hats? The weapons? The game modes?    The answer isn't rocket science; Team Fortress 2 lets you play what you want, when you want, and how you want. Want to play as a high-tech sniper, outfitted with machine guns and high-powered rifles? Jump right in and grab a Machina and a SMG. Prefer to go it old-style? Pick up a Huntsman or a Fortified Compound. Perhaps stealth is more your game? Spy is your class. From Scout to Spy, the possibilities are endless. In a game where team composition is key to victory, your decisions will affect how the round will go. If you think that you can sit around and do absolutely nothing, well, there are servers for that too!    But why get into Team Fortress 2? The glory days of 2007 have passed! Surely it's too old!      Am I too late to the party?    Calm down, buddy! You haven't missed a thing. The game has been tweaked and edited over the years, with Co-op gamemodes like Mann vs. Machine being added, as well as fancy new weapons and hats. By no means is the modding community done, nor is the creative community! In fact, why not try some of these activities for yourself! Want to see your items in game? Submit them to the workshop, gather support, and get famous! Add to the tide of change.    All right, but how  expensive  is it?      I don't want to spend a ton of money on items in game!    This game is absolutely free-to-play, and free-to-win. The weapons you get from the start are just as liable to win against players that have all the snazzy strange weapons. In fact, the stock weapons you have are some of the most reliable weapons you'll ever wield! You don't have to buy from the store to win (but the store does have some nice swag for your character!)  EDITOR'S NOTE: Thanks for reading my review. As you can see by my playtime, I thoroughly enjoy TF2. I have played since 2010 and have never regretted it once. I promise you that this game will not waste your time. Enjoy, everyone!"
"EDIT 11/23/2016: Voted for 'Test of Time' Award!  The simplicity of the game's design has really sparked some interest in me, not to mention tens of thousands of other people's too.   And because of this simplicity, it really gets set apart from other FPS games. Take the Medic for example:  A class with a gun that can bring back teammates from the brink of death and whose Übercharges change the flow of battle in mere seconds. The class itself is very unique and unlike anything seen before.  Another noteworthy class is the Spy: A backstabbing saboteur capable of cloaking away from enemies view and disguising as the opposing team.  The classes were given realistic personalities with a touch of humour. The community's perception of the game is very interesting.  Besides, who wouldn't want fat Russian men with burning hats eating sandwiches in the heat of battle?  As far as I know, no other video game has taken such a huge step away from the usual standards.  A remarkable game both artistically and comedically. It truly is the #1 war-themed hat simulator."
If i were write all the things i love about this game it would take me the rest of my life  If i were to write all the things i hate about this game i would only have to say 2 words:  Random Crits
"Team Fortress 2 . . . Yeah . . . Like there aren't already two thousand other recommendations, if your not sure you want it, there's very little I could say to sway you. It has tons of mods? In fact the only reason I started playing was because of a mod. That was quite a few years ago.  Game's is kinda addictive."
"After nine years of development, was it worth the weight?  Yes"
"highley addicting, once you play, you cant stop. Still better then Halo 6"
still gud another 10 years
"Welcome to Team Fortress 2, after 10,000 years in development, its still broken."
This is my favorite game of all time and i have spent way more time sucked into it trading and just dicking around with it than i should have and really the glitches and bugs are sometimes what gives this game charm and i havent just played with the playtime i have as i have at least 5 alt accounts with even more than 3000 hours on them so come on in join the community also its free so who can go wrong with that
Over 2500 hours and this game continues to be fun. If you enjoy shooting games at all and you have not tried this yet then make sure you hurry up and download this. Chances are you will not regret it.
"Tf2 is a free to play game! Until your addiction grows, and you buy hats, then strange weapons, then a new mouse, then unusuals, then a new gaming pc, then a 144Hz monitor. It's so good it'll ruin every other FPS forever for you.   10/10 Would play 2,000 hours of hat simulator again."
"The game is still extremely fun, if you can find the right match. Currently, that's a problem for me.  I really want to play this game with and against people, who know what they're doing. The problem is, Casual is just filled with players that are so new to the FPS genre in general, that it's extremely annoying, and Competitive forces specific graphics options, which lowers my FPS significantly, which makes it hard for me to even aim properly (Community servers are just cp_oranges, so no). When I try to find Casual matches, 97% of the time I get matched with some noobs and we just get utterly battered. The other 3% is either me finding a good game with good players on both team, or I just get a team who utterly stomps the other team. Also, when I try to find some CP matches, it takes aprox. 2-3 minutes just to find 1 game, and when I find one, I get put on the losing team, right at the end of the match.  The game's still fun, but this problem makes this game utterly annoying for me.    VOLVO, pls.  P.S. Payload is annoying."
Best war-themed hat simulator ever. 3/2
"I've spent all of my life on this game and keep coming back to it, 5/5 would buy more hats"
2000 hours in and still bad ;)
"This game is definitely a must-play. Very entertaining, not easy to get bored of, and not too competitive. It is also free to play, so anyone can download and play. Personally my favorite game. I recommend it."
The greatest hat simulator out there. You can even check what your hat would look like while you're dancing the conga! 10/10 would be f2p and make joke about how cool hats are
"Hats, Sandvich, cool people, craziness. Did I mention hats?  Update 2016 This game, I remember watching Team Fabulous 2 which got me into the game and made me play the actual map the video was used. Almost three years later, I've seen a lot of things. The Phlog, the Stickies, the Skins, No Halloween, Gunmettle, Tough Break, Love and War, End of the Line, and of course Meet Your Match. Though there have been good and bad times, it's always great to get back into this game and go wild."
I've played this game for over 1500 hours. It's too late to quit now.
"roses are red, random crits are lame, i have way too many hours, on this nine year old game."
"What more could you want from a game that's been going on for 8 years and running? Team Fortress 2 Is a huge place with of course lots of replayability, tons of weapons and cosmetics are right in for you to find your right loadout. Though lots of you may start as a F2P nothing is overpowered and underpowered as the TF Team keeps in check to balance all weapons out, even with just your stock weapons you can always find all the weapons while playing the game. 9 years in Development hell and it still holds pretty damn strong from the updates and additions, but if you want to be premuim just buy something very cheap from the tf store so you can trade, be premuim and etc.  I don't know if i'm crazy, but i've met veterens who has played for 5 years and only has played around 1,000 hours which i've played through 1-2 years, which tells me how much TF2 has gotten me into it.  If you need a game to play any day, Team Fortress is there for you with Diversity, style, and funny mercs."
"I don't really play this game as much as I used to, but it'll always the 'special' game to me."
Play it for the memes  11/9
"TF2 is probably one of the Best Games EVER invented. It combines your 'usual' FPS with cartoonish, highly customisable Characters. Each of the 9 Classes are evenly balanced in such a way that no class is better or worse than another. They all have Pros and Cons that cancel each other out. Along with Weapons which have additional statistics to further add to that Class' Abilities. All in all, it's a Fast-Paced, Highly Strategic FPS that is Continuously, Thouroughly Enjoyable. 10 / 10 :D"
Probably my favourite game of all-time :)
"4 words, THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!"
Top shelf
"A great and simply amazing game, if u dont have it u need to get it."
Loving the weapons. Hate that I still can't get a detonator :(
It 's a fun game with graphics encouraged besides that the items are very cool I am sure that the creators of this game have work so much.Oh and you can find maps of other players with different types of maps such as maps slender .And recently he has left the owerwatch I 'm still saying that have been copied by a little team fortress 2
"Please go to this petition and sign it, and hopefully we can fix this game.   https://www.change.org/p/valve-valve-please-fix-tf2?recruiter=289520617&amp;utm_source=share_for_starters&amp;utm_medium=copyLink "
"After for nearly 5 years worth of TF2. I've come to the conclusion, that this game is fun at points. But its now getting boring. All of these updates valve are putting out is killing the community. Not that they see its happening. But there has been so many mishaps that valve has done. Then they don't see there mistake, so they leave it in and do nothing about it. The Pyro VS. Heavy thing is very annoying and most people will only play as pyro just to destory the enemy team. With the buff received to the flame thrower, it seems valve is favoring the team Pyro. Seeing how destructive heavy is. But Pyro without the buff would of still destoryed Team heavy.  While Valve has removed Quickplay and im kinda triggered about this. I actually like the new casual system, as you get rewarded with playing the game. But there are people who get salty and leave the game. Not knowing that you won't lose XP. Why haven't Valve added back auto balancing? A butt load of people are complaining about Valve removing AutoBalancing. This has made games where it would be a 6 v 12 or 8v12. Which is way too stacked unless the players on the team of 8 people are pretty good at the game. I also hate it how they removed 3rd person spectating. But, Some good things came from this. Community servers are being more played. I, someone who always plays on a community server always had trouble trying to fill it. Now its pretty easy!  Competitive is a mess. Locked FOV at 54, People can leave and not lose any XP and get just a 30 min cool down, The people who actually win and stay in the game, don't get xp if even one person left, and the worse of all. Most people in competitive are way to low lvl'd to play as some of them are gold-plat but are still in rank one since. They derank. While there is a butt load of people actually willing to play Competitive, Most people play TF2 casually and not competitively. If Valve Released it sooner, MAYBE would it of had a impact on the community. But no, It was released along with a lot of other changes.  Valve says there listening to players. But there listening to Professionals. NOT PLAYERS. They ask the people who have way more skill than someone like me who has barely played competitive TF2 but i still know alot about the game and how it works. While Valve wants to improve there game, they just can't. You can't fix your mess up valve. While, the new maps are a good touch. I still would of perfered if Valve would not ♥♥♥♥ up every type on community. Like the casual/pub community by removing quickplay and adding casual. The Trading community by making every single bloody hat all class. Valve doesn't get there game like we do. There trying to make us all happy. But alot of people see it differently We aren't Valve, So we can't choose what we want to put in the game. Or what to fix.  Well. I'll give this game a 7/10. I've been playing it forever, and wasted countless of thousands of dollars on just this one game. I might quit one day. But today isn't that day."
The best game I've ever played you can meet great people and friedns and have a lot of fun. I recommend to play
"Epic game! Type of addicted game. A good game for a good timepass. So many game modes, fun playing, free playing. What else you need? Epic!"
"So after I've been playing this game from time to time and also made several GMod-animations over a period of 6 years, I've decided to write a review about the details you may not think too much of but which sepperates this game from the other class-based shooters and makes it much more addicting.  The first thing is that Team Fortress 2 has a lot of fun goodies implemented. These fun goodies includes; a great variety of voice-commands and voice-lines for the different classes, cosmetic items to decorate and personalize each class, and also the famous unique taunt-animations for each weapon the class posseses. Players can use these creatively to communicate and express themselves to other players in a weird funny manner, making them bond with the characters on a whole new level apart from the shooting. The gunplay is very responsive and satisfying. From each rocket you shoot with the Soldier class to every simple pistol round you fire, it feels impactful. Just making small damage to someone still feels satisfying, which in turn makes people wanna play these less bursty but still very important classes. The different mods and maps players create gives this game a whole new life. There has been times where I only played on Surf maps, balloon_race maps, Saxton Hale servers and fun-servers. However, these have lost a lot of attention since the introduction of matchmaking which has made new players unaware of their existence. But the modding community is still great and player shortage is not a problem! :)  So yeah, this sums up why I find this shooter much more addicting than other team based shooters such as Overwatch. Overwatch is still a great game of course, but I haven't found the same free expression feeling which Team Fortress 2 brings. I'd love to see that game get mod support and have some more fooling around rather than just strictly compete with others."
I LIKE IT SO MUCH.!!!!!
  would lose my sanity again 10/10
"Now able to get aliens drunk, 10/10"
Honestly this is one of the best games i have ever played in my life and i love it so much :D:D definatley recommend this game to everyone especially as it is free to play
"TF2 is an amazing game. The weapons give depth to a already devloped game. However with new games on the block, it's hard to find a good mvm server due to the decline of players. However, I will still stand by my point that this is one of my favourite games of all time.  Thank you for looking, "
"You can eat a sandwich while playing a game where you eat sandwiches 10/10 GOTY,"
"This game is awsome. From being a soldier to being a medic this game will make you want to play it more. There are many different classes to choose, two of them are what I said above. You unlock new wepons and new costumes to dress up as to be amazing. There is multiplayer so if you want to play with your friends and have a laugh go ahead. This is a review by trojansforlife."
hats
"Because of this game, I'm a decent animator, I've met the greatest girl in the world &amp; I've laughed and enjoyed so many new friends.  11/10 would play again."
10/10
10/10 This is the only game that I play right now!!!
"This is one of the best class choosing games I have played in my life. Great graphics, great system of finding weapons, and great game modes"
One of the greatest games out there. Team Fortress 2 has yet to unsatify me. There is basically anything you can do whether it be trading to competitive 6v6. 10/10 WOuld recommend
This is tha best game on this Planet yeh! you can either be freindly or blow the living turky out of F2Ps I like to do the 2nd one its fun! I recommend you play this m8 its is soo MLG yeah 
"Well personally i enjoy Playing this game but thats my opinion. Theres lots of gore, guns, taunts and hats. Its a game full of intrestiong glitchs that valve leave in for the sake of the players because the glitches are just hilarious. Due to the recent update of meet your match the new match making is fixed and now theres no auto scrambiling (THANK GOD). Definitly give this game a try. Some very odd stuff can happen but its mostly a really good game."

How to have fun on this game:  Main Soldier
"  I only started to play this game in August of 2015, and I was immediately hooked. It is appealing to wide range of gamers and skill levels, whether you are F2P or have spent 1000 dollars on the game. With hundreds of custom game modes and a million different loadout combinations, there is no way for someone to get bored.  What makes the game stand out is how team based gameplay is encouraged and how the game plays differently than every other FPS. Unlike other FPSes, when two people see each other, one of them isn't going to die within the next 0.5 seconds. You have a chance to have proper fights and exploit your strengths and the opponent's weaknesses.  I would recommend TF2 to every person reading this."
very addictive
Havent played so much but it seems good
good game i find it 1 of the best free to play games
"Just got the game yesterday, pretty decent!"
"This game is fun and a time killer after a long days work, I enjoy it very much"
A fast paced first person shooter with an array of entertaining game modes and probably the most inticate character customization market known to man. A game that has been in my library since day one and still gets a few solid hours of play every week.
My best online shooter game on steam.
"The, in my opinion, best first-person shooter, with 9 completely different classes and it's very own economy. Go ahead and give it a try, it's free-to-play!"
Best f2p game !!!
*ties to shoot a rocket at someone* *rocket bounces back instead* *gets blown up* *ragequit* 11/10 would get rekt again
"'The most fun you can have, for free.' This still holds mostly true.  Even though the developers made a few debatable decisions the past few years, the game still holds a great amount of fun.  Newcomers will be able to discover all the quirky bits of the game on the rich variety of maps and gamemodes, experimenting with all kinds of strategies, classes and subclasses, weapons and other fishes.  Veterans can still find their dose thanks to the high skill ceiling -revolving mostly around movement- or just by goofing around with friends.  The game is however aging. But it does so quite well! Like every aging thing, it changes, and it matters enough for people to complain about it!  Although gradually coming to its end, the game is still well alive and a source of fun for anybody willing to find it!"
"Played for some time, being veteran-ish (played since 2012) and still suck at the game"
"I don't think there's a way to NOT recommend Team Fortress 2. This is a prime example of Valve at it's best. Introduced back in 2007, Team Fortress 2 paved the way for many more games after it and to this day remains insanely popular, with good reason. This once-$20 title proved you could put massive personality and character into a multiplayer based shooter, combined with classic FPS mechanics that work pretty much flawlessly.  The game is expertly designed around 3 core modes - control point, king of the hill, and payload. More have been added since, including Mann vs. Machine (coop), Medieval Mode, and others. Maps in the game are fairly large and open, allowing for multiple tactics to be taken in approaching the enemy rather than funnelling all players down singular corridors or openings, with some paths being clearly defined and some less so, giving it a very natural feel. Each of the 9 characters acts as its' own class with an array of appropriate weaponry and skills that are swappable using item drops you obtain through playing the game, though no item is over or underpowered, meaning the system remains balanced even for those who use entirely stock loadouts or haven't found other weapons or items yet. Despite being free and having a store to buy things from, this is far from a pay to win game, and likely never will be. You'll never feel like you're incapable of contributing the appropriate amount to your team simply due to a lack of loadout items.  The game is also heavily community focused, with massive modding support built in. This means HUNDREDS of player made game modes and THOUSANDS of maps. On top of that, the large majority of all items in the game that are usable as cosmetics and sometimes as weapons were entirely designed by the community, meaning if you DO so choose to buy them, the creators of those items get a share of the money. Even some game modes like Medieval Mode were initially community created modes made official. You are in no way restricted to what the developers created for this game, and in fact I personally have more fun going out and finding these massively modded servers, maps, and modes. There's also a competitive system in the game now, which puts the game more in line with some of its' competitors that, keep in mind, this game directly inspired the creation of, such as Overwatch. I, however, have never used the competitive system and likely won't, but it's a fantastic addition for those who want to play with a sense of stakes and locked-down, smaller teams of 6 that are truly trying to win rather than simply there to play around.  I can't not recommend this game. It's a classic-styled class-based FPS with massive personality and a far more massive list of features and things to do. There's a reason everyone's heard of Team Fortress 2. If you haven't, just go hit that play button. You'll see."
"THIS. GAME. IS. AWESOME. Epic multiplayer and co-op experience, amazing first person gameplay, exellent comical graphics, and, as PC Gamer calls it, 'the best fun you can have online.' Enjoy!"
Best game ever love the hats and taunts  Hat simulator 2016

"Team Fortress 2, by far one of the longest lasting FPS to ever exist, is overall rather enjoyable. However, I feel there is a lack of interest in the game from the developers. With almost no valve enployees having played the game frequently, the devs are almost just adding stuff without really knowing how it will effect the game. This has caused major issues with the community, with the removal of 'Quickplay' and the introduction of 'Casual Mode' lots of people lost the feeling of the game and what it used to be and moved on to the games successor - Overwatch. Not only has casual mode scared off a chunk of TF2s player-base, its Level System is entirely cosmetic and there is no reward for playing the game except a shiny badge which eventually stops upgrading at level 150.  Casual mode was not the only thing introduced - there also was Matchmaking, or MM for short. This encluded a more competitive environment for the game and tried to get people into playing Team Fortress 2 as a serious First Person Shooter, like its cousin - Counter Strike: Global Offensive. Not only was this not needed, as websites such as TF2Center and TF2Stadium existed for that kind of thing, but i think a very tiny proportion of the player base actually bother playing MM. Im not entirely sure, but im quite certain there are more people using TF2Center than there ever are using MM. The maps Valve have tried to add to the map rotation in MM are ridiculous too, i remember a while back when they tried to add ctf_turbine to the rotation, which was absolutely god awful and i beleive was later removed due to the outcry of the community.  But let us not dwell on all the bad things about the game - the games classes and costumability is what i love about this game. People like to say Overwatch is 'TF3', but its really not. The classes in this game aren't just what they appear, the different weapons and play styles that you can adapt whilst playing defines the game and how you enjoy it, which too me is alot better than 21 heroes which i barely know all the names of in a futuristic setting. The games humour and graphics are very appealing and definetly put the game from other FPSes such as COD and CS:GO. The enormous plethera of maps to chose from in the game is absolutely incredable, with 9 total gamemodes (not encluding the variety of modes made by the community offered through the community servers list), the game is very broad in what it allows you to do. The Mann Vs. Machine PvE mode, despite being neglected in terms of content additions, is very enjoyable also, with its nice skin rewards and ability to reward killstreaks for your weapons is good way of getting nice items without having to blow a wod of cash.  In summary, i do recommend this game to anyone who likes Class Based Shooters, however I believe the devs at Valve could be doing a bit of a better job with it all. I rate 8/10. (^-^)"
love this game
YES I LIKE THIS NEW GAME
This game has been going strong for 7 years and keeps growing. It's Free To Play and a good FTP can beat a person who paid for a lot of stuff. 10/10 would play again. It's the most fun you can legally have online for free.
Good game . Should try it !
Team fortress 2 is a fun and team bazed game. You can rule what you wanna play and how you look. really fun to play and it's free
I LOVE THIS GAME :D
MEEEEEEEEEEEDIIIIIIIIIIC!!
Been playing this game for 9 years I think it's time to give it a review....  If you haven't started playing yet what the heck is wrong with you?  Anyway back to the game.....
It's self explanitory. It's just tf2. I have nothing else to say.
Game is game
"sup if you like badass trading, item and crafting and them servered games thin i highly recomend this to evreone evreware thumbs up to valve and sodahappy"
Thanks to this game I rage! ;u; Thank you for making me rage ;u;
It is a great game but it use to be better now the prices of keys are still going up and the bots are ruining trading but it is still a good game
"This game is fun and cool i love it alot i think i started playing this last year and im so used to it but theres one thing that is wrong 'kindness' many people argue &lt; don't know if i spelled it correctly but many people fight and i have experienced this i fought with a person well idk why but i don't really fight with people anymore but all i wan't is non rude people and people that are kind and awsome people are totally part of humanity :D i recommend you guys play this game but stay out of trouble there are also community servers if you don't know what it means its games that people create and its fun the games i play on community servers...deathrun,jailbreak,dodgeball and many other stuff i guess but the server is outpost my favourite server anyways play this and have fun! :D"
Really awesome game. Love it!
This game got hats ITS PERFECT!
This is a really awesome game! it has a lot of character customizations along with different maps to play on and a extreame amount of acheivements to earn. Great game.
It is unheard of to have such a remarkable folllowing and support for a free game in this throw away society we live in and i am proud to be a TF2 supporter
great game i have been playing it for a long time but i thougth it was time to leave a review. it's a great game
That game has become my life.
Game has lasted very long and still gets support off valve
Best game 8/10. Takes a while for it to start to get boring.
'The most fun you can have online' is the most appropriate comment for this AWESOME game.
The world's most popular hat simulator. ...and an awesome game as well.
"A great game based around teamwork and nine diverse classes - you've probably heard this time and time again about TF2. You've also probably noticed I like to use '-' a lot when I make reviews.  This is one of those games that'll never get old, and although many games try to take a step up from TF2, none will ever do it (looking at you Overwatch).  My only complaint is the occasional lack of attention it gets from Valve, as the Loch n Load was pure evil for a large portion of 2015. The comic that was promised 'bi-monthly' has been extremely inconsistent and is actually once every two years (or even later).  The gameplay itself makes up for the lack of frequent updates and lack of bug fixes, but I really think this game could shine if the TF2 Team invested more resources and time into its e-sports scene and just the game in general.  10/10, needs more updates."
i love it. tf2 is my life  :D best game ever
The different classes that this game has is definitely awesome.  PROS: Different classes for different playstyles.  Trading  Fun Co-Op which is Mann vs Machine  Public as well as private servers CONS: Must have premium for better crap.
"With 600 hours on TF2,i can say that this game is beautiful. It has a very special community,very good gameplay,and for the best: HATS! 9 classes with different types of gameplay. Lots of GameStyles,maps,and weapons. What's best? It is NOT pay to win. Every weapon that you see,you can get it dropped or crafting it. Very good game if you like to play with your team.  Yes,for expert players,600 is not a big number,but i've learned a lot in the past hours with this game. But there is something that still makes me  think..Why?   Lots of new players can't play the game normally because of some other players that can't accept them in the game. Same as a ''gameplay style'' for the class called ''Pyro'' that is the action to run forward to the enemy and at the same time,clicking Mouse1. This is normally called ''w+m1'' for the community. But i'll tell you something. Play the game normally. Enjoy it. Don't mind other players if they insult you or other bad things.  There are videos on youtube for the 9 classes at ''Meet the ----'',showing them on the game.  Enjoy the game!"
bad game cant find run button
"Do you like taunting people? like laughing at the occasional CoD player? enjoy an economy? do you like blowing things up and make people flip? Well then play this, it contains all that and more!  Update: The game has been really buggy for a while (bad hit detection it seems) and I really hope it gets fixed because I truly do love playing this game when it wants to cooperate."
"I realy love this game, will play it for a VERY long time"
"I hat to say it, but this game's lost it's original charm with me. I used to love it before it hat got all these new weapons and unlocks. Now it's all about cosmetics and who can get the fanciest hats. The gameplay's alot messier than it hat used to be, with so much visual clutter going on, all the weapons and hats clogging up your view, I really hat it. As if it hatn't been enough to introduce hats to begin with, soon the hat entire thing just became about hats. Hats hats hats, that's all people care about anymore, not hat good the game is, just hats. Hats hats hats. I don't hat get it hat. It's like some hat kind of hat epidemic or somehat. When hat will hat end hat??? When Hat stop hat hat hat hat?! HAT!? Hat hat hat!! HAT HAT. Hat hat hat. Hat... Just Hat... Hat hat hat? Hat hat.  Pros +Hat +Hat hat hat +Hats +Hats for hats +Good hat +Hat +Hat hats +Hat +Hat Life 3 +Burning hat??? +Hats!  Cons -Hat -Hat hat... Really hat? -Robohat -Hat hat -Very poor hat -Very VERY hat  TL;DHat Hat/Hat"
One of the best games out there!
Great game very addictive
"This is the best game ever i would recommend this game to any one who like's fps's.   Edit After over a 1,000 Hours in TF2 all i can say is it's been that long?  Edit for the steam awards  I nominate this game for the The “Test of Time” Award. Reason It's been 9 years and let's just say it's been woth the weight wtih over 1,000 hours into this game i can say I'll never get tired if this game &lt;3"
"For about six years now, I've been a long-time collector of items in Team Fortress 2, trying to stay on top of new stuff when it comes out. And as frustratingly hard as both being halfway decent at this game, and collecting those items sometimes is, I wouldn't trade a minute of it for the world.  I say that because Team Fortress 2 is genuinely one of the most fun experiences I've ever had with a video game, multiplayer or otherwise. I'm utterly terrible at most video games, and that's no exception here, but the fun I've had with TF2 in those sparse instances where I'm okay at it makes me forget all of that, and just have fun with it. At its core, the game has a charm to me that's never even come close to dying out.  A lot of people say this game jumped the shark when they added weapon skins, or when they added Casual Mode and Competitive Mode. And while I agree that matchmaking in general could be vastly improved, and has been a source of my anger for a few months now, I still love the game at its core, for MVM (which is my mainstay) and a little bit of PVP every now and again. I genuinely don't think it's just buyer's remorse -- there IS fun to be had with TF2 even to this day, and I really am having fun with it.  I've met so many good friends and have so many accomplishments thanks to Team Fortress 2 that this one game has practically changed my entire life. And I'll love every minute of its past, present and future until the time the servers shut down; at which point, I will frame my collection as several large pictures, on each wall of my house, as a memento of time well spent."
"This game is slowly breaking me. My addiction is coming to an all-time high. Get away while you still can.  Nah, seriously. It's great."
"Not a whole lot has to be said about TF2. It's a team arena shooter with a focus on casual gameplay, as opposed to most other multiplayer titles with a focus on competitve formats. As most people know, TF2 has had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ year in 2016 due to both major patches being borked on launch, however that does not mean it's a bad game itself. TF2 may not be a great game for people who enjoy MOBAs and games like CSGO or OW, but it fills a niche not many games have, can, or want to realize. Obviously, any game that has been out as long as TF2 has will have a lot of community content, but TF2 has garnished so much, some people will expressly play TF2 for modes like Saxton Hale, Randomizer, Deathrun, etc. Of course, the actual game of TF2 is also well realized and offers both what you'd expect from a multiplayer title, and then some more unique ones like Player Destruction or Special Delivery. It's hard to summarize everything that makes TF2 great, and it will vary person-to-person, but TF2 is a great game that is worth trying for anyone, though at its point, almost everyone has probably played the game."
"TF2 is one of my favorite game is the game that i spend alot of time and enjoy the most. but one thing that is realy anoying on this game is the majors updates. those update can change the game so much(meet your match,gun mettle) and that cause many TF2 players to quit the game. but the game is realy fun so i recommend this game"
"Good times, worth every single hour"
Good game to play with friends!
It's like overwatch but from 2007
"Hidden beneath the best hat simulator ever is a shooter, I swear."
5/5 needs more hats
"Still in love one year, and one thousand hours, later. &lt;3"
"Welp, I'm late to the party so here goes. Short, sweet, and positive, right?  Well to be honest, the game does have its flaws. (Maybe too many now compared to its release.) However, from my experience, the biggest difference between this game and others is the randomness. That randomness is what makes this game so much fun to play and to waste all your time and money in. 'XD  I love this game, and I hope you (or other new people) will give this game a chance and have some fun.   All I can say in warning is to expect the unexpected."
@ ^@
what can i say about this game that hasn't been said  this game is my life now  no escape...  Edit: It's starting to slow a bit updates are mostly disapointing sucks but i'm still a fan of this wonderfull game. This game should get the test of time award for it's support and player base over the many years
thanks for game :)
"This game is amazing. It is the best FPS that I have played in all my gaming years 5 Stars: ***** This game is for those FPS players who just want some hilarious gameplay. This game has many easter eggs and has may in game rewards. You should all go out and play this funny and wierd game, full of crap from another universe. Not to mention it has stood the test of time. Gotta love 2007 ;)"
"it never occurred to me that i never did recommend this. but then again did i really have to in the first place? one of the best Free to play games out there, it never was pay to win. it was pay to look Rad!!!"
This game is always full of fun moments when you play with friends. One of those few games i will keep coming back to play.
This game is like a Delivery room. Full of babies that you want to kick so bad.
"Team Fortress 2 is what got me into playing computer games.  Prior to Team Fortress 2, I had primarily played Nintendo video games-- that is, I was always playing my Wii or Nintendo DS whenever possible. However, when I first downloaded TF2 and started playing during the Scream Fortress 2013 update, I was hooked. I started to play the game religiously, and would continue to for about 2 more years.  What truly keeps the game running is how much support Valve is willing to contribute to a free to play 9+ years old game. Thanks to updates like Gun Mettle, Tough Break, and the constant Scream Fortresses and Smissmasses, Team Fortress has stayed as relevant as ever in terms of content like new maps, weapons, and cosmetics.  This isn't to say there are bad sides to this game. For starters, TF2 is running off an old game engine, and thus is starting to chug on systems that are too new for it. FPS drops are common, for instance. Adding on, some updates Valve has added have not been very quality, and thus have not been well recieved by the community, like the End of the Line update.  So, why am I recommending this game? Because of how much fun it was, and how much fun it still is today. Despite games like Paladins, Battleborn, and Overwatch existing, I still come back to TF2 every now and then. Team Fortress 2 is what inspired me to build my own PC and escape the hell that was 10 FPS gaming on a laptop, transitioning to 120+ FPS on my 'new' desktop. In addition, I have met so many wonderful people in my 1900+ hours that have influenced how I play and how I interact ingame. Without these people, I'm sure my life on Steam would be a little less fun."
Epic.  Edit: its pretty mediocre tbh
"This game has almost 10 years of maps, weapons, cosmetics and more. There's so many ways to play with all the combinations of maps, game modes, classes, weapons that you'll always have something new to try out."
"meh, its a good game, i like it. re-read the top I guess"
"This game is very fun and if you haven't already, you should try it out!"
"The game is fast paced. Each class having their own speed, hp, each class having strong and weak points against each other class. With lots of colourfull game modes, hats, personalities, weapons, classes and ways to play each of them. A game where payment is truely optional. Being a f2p doesn't necesarilly mean you're any worse than a p2p, it just means you can only have 10 hats at most."
"A quest for hats, a timeless mission - comes with objectives and time limits."
Quite the classic... and it isn't even Team Fortress Classic xD
Met a lot of my best friends on this game. Had some great times and fond memories. Don't know what I'd do without it.
After playing this game for a while I have come to a conclusion about this game.  PROS:almost everything  CONS:waiting time can be a bit sluggish at times  But all in all it is one of the best games I have played on steam! Good Job and take my money Gaben! XD
"This is a great game although hats and cool stuff like that are hard to get, the gmae is alot of fun to play when bored and angry and happy. I just have never gotten a cool weapon that i love or a really cool hat.... PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!"
"This is the best free game on steam, and the awesome thing is that it is actually free. I just hope valve releases Team Fortress 3 in my lifetime."
I haven't played enough to say too much but this is a good game...
very good game for people that don't have money. 
"great gameplay, great people, great fun"
This game is good
Wow what an amazing game with all my accounts I've spent 1800 hours on it and I haven't Nearly done everything in the game!
Better Dress-Up game than Super Mega Dreamhouse Barbie Prom 2015. 11/10 
Lots of Fun &amp; Hats!
Awesome and fun game!
BEST GAME EVER MADE!
"'Now, I had a review for this game for quite a long time. Years in fact, and it never really had much content or wording to it. So, I think TF2 is that kind of game to recieve an updated review from me'  What can I say about this game? There's just too much to summarise, such as the gamemodes, variety of gameplay styles, weapon and player customisation. And most importantly, the Community.  The community is the strongest part to this brilliant game, as not only do the workers at Valve generate the freedom and excitement to such a unique stature of gaming. The Community also work themselves to keep this game thriving to achieve at staying on top, and being the best of the best.  SFM Videos, Gmod Skits/Animations, Awards, Community maps &amp; models, the workshop. You name it. The Community has the game's side at staying at the top."
"It seems simplistic, but this game can give you hundreds of hours of entertainment"
"this game is so awsome,baby! "
If you havent played this game there is something wrong with you.
"Such a fun game, couldn't resist investing money!!!!!"
"i'm 100% addicted to this game, its a really fun game with many ways to play it. its unlike most games in terms of its game play yet probably better than any other game ive ever played, you are able to customize your character loadout (and theres 9 different characters/classes you can choose from to start) tons of game modes and maps plus its free! ive meet many people and made many friends by playing this game, and i know you will too. id rate this game 11/10 and id recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a new amazing game to play, and a new addiction."
THATS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
11/10 would play again
"I have played many games in my life, and I can say with confidence after playing this game consistently every day (ha, loser) for over a year.... THIS IS THE GREATEST GAME EVER. Also, best hat simulator imaginable."
Is very cool play
"This game is... it's... it's too great to be described with mere adjectives! This game is absolutely with out a doubt one of the best games out there! It was indeed 'Worth the Weight'. It's art style is amazing because it is so unique and different from anything I've ever seen, this goes for both the characters, items, and enviorment. I find the game's visual appearence breathtaking. For the small amount of soundtracks this game consists of, they are amazing. This game is great because it seemingly never gets old, with dozens of different gamemodes, exciting new content updates, and its annual Scream Fortress, Smissmas, and other events. Yet, the best thing about the game (at least to me it is) is the nine classes that the game consists of. Each class is full of personality and dialogue, whether its insulting taunts or hillarious cathphrases. All of the classes are very different from each other with weapons, dialogue, attitude, style, and the way you play as them. First off you have your Offensive category, consisting of the Scout, Soldier, and Pyro. The Scout is a fast, smart-mouthed, 'all bark and no bite' kind of kid with weapons that are most effective at close range, requiring a hit-and-run sort of tactic. The Soldier is a dedicated American with a strong passion to fight. Possessing a Rocket Launcher as his primary weapon, the soldier is a powerful threat to his opponents, but all that power leaves him with a slow speed, requiring him to use a maneuver known as the 'Rocket Jump' to travel faster in exchange for some health. The Pyro is a mumbling lunatic, whose history is a mystery to just about everyone, he (or possibly she) wields a Flamethrower as his/her main weapon which makes him/her lack a lot of range, but gives a lot of potential power if used correctly. He/she is best used for ambushing enemies and his/her Compresion Blast (Airblast) can be used to reflect many projectiles back at opponents. Next is the Deffensive category, the Demoman, Heavy, and Engineer. The Demoman is a one-eyed, drunk Scottish man who has no bullet-based weapons and fights instead with 2 explosive weapons. He can take out enemies that he can't see with his Grenade Launcher or lay traps with his Sticky Launcher. The Heavy is a large, strong, Russian beast that uses his beloved Minigun. His immense power and large size leaves him with a very slow speed but with very strong fire power. He may be considered an easy target due to his size, but as long as he has his Minigun he should be treated as a threat just like all the other classes. The Engineer is a intelligent Texan that relies mainly on his buildings to fight. His Sentry Gun is generally a threat to any enemy within it's range, he can build a Dispenser to heal him and his teammates as well as refill there ammo, and he can also build teleporters so his team can access areas faster. The last category is the Supportive classes, consisting of the Medic, Sniper, and Spy. The Medic is a German doctor with amazing medical technology at his disposal. He is not one known for attacking but instead he is known for healing. Using his Medi-gun, he can quickly heal his teammates. Once charged enough, he can deploy what is known as an 'Ubercharge', making him and whoever he is healing temporarily invincible to any damage from enemy weapons. The Sniper is an Austrailian outdoorsman who, as his name suggests, uses a Sniper Rifle as his main weapon. He can do extreme ammounts of damage at long range, making him a valueble teammate when used correctly. At short range though, he is more vulnerable and can easily be overwhelmed by enemies. Lastly, we have the Spy, a French trickster who can disguise himself as his opponents and quietly sneak behind enemy lines. He can perform a 'Backstab', resulting in an instant kill, use his Sapper to destroy enemy buildings such as Sentries, and use his Cloaking Device to become temporarily invisible to sneak around danger. Playing as a Spy requires stealth and smarts to succeed. The best thing about all these characters is the fact that, other than the Heavy being the games main Icon, none of the classes seem to be better than the rest. They all have their own special weaknesses and none of them are generally favored over the others. The game is a masterpiece and that's all I can say."
i love this game to much to not set it down lol
A great game for casual and competitive players that is based heavily on teamwork. I give it 9 out of 10 due to some steam cloud errors on occasion but otherwise this is a great game!

most addicting game ever #1 best cartoon first person shooter EVER!!! 
"Team Fortress 2 is an FPS game with a singleplayer and multiplayer servers. I think that this game is awesome, but they need to upgrade the weapon/item drop system, it needs to give new players a few more items than people who have been playing the game more often. The textures are somewhat realistic with a sort of 'cartoony' feel to them. The player models are good but could use a little more detail, even if it's a 'cartoony' game. Basic plot: Mann CO. a company run by the tough Saxton Hale who had 3 sons, Red, Blu, and Grey. Red and Blu exiled Grey and fought with eachother like maniacs. Grey came back with replicas of Red and Blus armies, Robots. Classes: Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demo, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy."
best game ever made that i had ever played
"This game is definitely part of my 'top 5 best games vis' In this game you have 9 classes with different features, personalities, stories and of course weapons. Hats plays a big role in the game, but it is completely illogical because no other FPS does not have any hats :3 Hats are awesome as well."
I want all people to try this game.This game is great
Too many teams games? Your fortress getting to lonely? Need a number 2?  Gaben's got you covered   -Dramaic music- Staring:  Bruce willis and Bruce wayne   In Bruce I've gotta bruce 2! From the directors of 'Gaben! wheres my car!'
This is the best FTP game I have ever played and would recommend this to anyone looking to have fun without spending money!
Awsome!
this game is awsome
"Friends don't let friends not play TF2. If you have not played yet, I hope you are downloading TF2 as you read this."
"I was going to make a joke about hats but nah. Team Fortress 2 is a fun game. You could spend hours and hours on this game without getting tired of it. Unlike oh-so-srs games it gives you a fun cartoony feel. Like Happy Tree Friends (if you don't know what that is don't google it). TF2 caters to all sorts of people. For hoarders you have hats n ♥♥♥♥, for achievement hunters there's a whole crap ton I can't be bothered to do, for people who like shooting things then TF2 won't dissapoint. Also it's free...FREE. As in not a single cent. 11/10 would play for another 374 hours"
"Addicting DO NOT PLAY YOU WILL GET HOOKED IN SO MUCH, IT WILL KILL YOU. LIKE FLAPPY BIRD BUT WORSE."
hats hats baby
"This is the best hat simulator in existence. This sounds silly and it is... until you've played it. It won't be long before you find yourself involved in the meta trading game crafting weapons and on the quest for ever cooler hats to replace your Ghastly GIbus and prove you are no longer a noob. You will finally give in on microtransactions and be glad you did. As far as gameplay goes... well, it's probably the best class based shooter out there. The game works and is always kept polished and regularly updated and supported by the community and Valve. With the 9 different classes, there are many more ways to play just based on what your item loadout is, but nothing is really overpowered, just situational in it's advantage. The competative scene is real and there is an incredibly high skill cap within that; time and experience in the game to the tune of thousands of hours actually mean something in terms of your ability to be good at it. And probably the thing that's better than any of this: It's freaking FUN."
Its a nice game that can get very addictive.
"This game can ruin lives and ruin friendships, at the same time collect hats and guns. 10/10"
"One of the best free 2 play first person shooter's out there, just cant be beaten."
"This is a good game, especially because it's free! It's great fun but not like other shooting games. Try it and you won't be dissapointed! 5* fun"
Really good game!
goodgame. ~ Lobster 17/4   Hattrader Simulator 2014
TF2 is nice game.
Spending my time on this game. I love it.
Just plain awsome 
plz join my TF2 Server If you like to subscribe
Such a fun game. Takes time to get used to but lots of fun!
"Hours and hours of fun, most enjoyable game I've played so far! =))"
"good game, i just want the badge"
"Lot's of fun, definitly something that should be tried atleast once"
the best of the best
Fun fun fun what can u wish more than fun?
This Game Changed My Life In Many Ways :)
"Best FPS ever! I was once an unbeliever, but it didn't take long for me to get addicted. The only thing I wish this game had is a built-in homework-doer and outside-life-liver. Otherwise, I'd be playing it all the time. My advice to anyone who values their current social life: Don't play this game too much if you don't have good real-life friends who also play. And remember, kids, TF2 is not real life. I'm generally considered a noob at this game, but I still have plenty of fun being killed, or if I'm lucky, finding someone else I can kill. Let me repeat myself: don't take this game too seriously. It's a lot of fun until you forget it's a game."
Best f2p FPS out there.
Best game i ever played. I will play it for the rest of my life
Best Free To Play game i have ever played
by far the MOST fun i've ever had. (P.S.: HATS!!!)
It is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!
"There is really no game alike, you will get dragged into a world of hats and stranges before you know it. Addiction to rare items guaranteed.   Best. Game. Ever."
THOU GAME IS THE best game I have probably played in my life :D ILOVEIT
Awesome game and now free to play. ;)
Things that i like about this game: -Hats (gonna waste my money again 10/10) -not a bad community  -Taunts ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) -Gud classes Things i hate: -random crits  -Pyros  -brainless F2P that dont know how to shoot (yes they exit among us ;_;) -MLG Snipars :&lt;  But overall gud gam 10/10 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
"This hat-trade-simulation game is very good, and when you're bored of it, it also comes with a balanced team based competitive shooting multiplayer."
"I loved this game until the most recent update. Basically they have made Team Fortress 2 more competitive than it really should be; using things like ranks and a competitive mode. Another thing is that with the new UI everything is more confusing. For example, if you only want to join a certain game mode you have to untick every box apart from that one.  Team Fortress 2 is about having fun not competitions, if you want a competitive FPS go play CS:GO not TF2."
I recommend this game to people who like hats
More fun than expected!
♥♥♥♥♥♥
I love the game &lt;33333333333
"Absolutley brilliant! You can't beat a bit of TF2. It has its own quirks and a massive, friendly and helpful community! If you're reading this then I command you to get this game! NOW!"
it is a cool game
i reccomend this game because it has all diffrent featurs from diffrent games like the fortfield compound from the new game thief! 
"If this game were a potato, it would be a good potato."
What do you think you're doing not playing this I mean come on
Nice and Fun
this game is really fun once you get the hang of what you're doing
This Is A Great Game I Meet alot of people on TF2
The best modern FPS Strategy game out there :D It might take a while before you get the hang of it... you really need a friend that know what they are doing. Over all 10/10
GOTTA MOVE THAT GEAR UP
Da best free to play. PERIOD
"Played the game for 2 years now and at almost 900 hours on record,the game still didnt get old and it's still as fun as 2 years ago.  Really great game!"
Got hats? GET MORE HATS!  11/10 - IGN 10/10 - JonTron 10/√9 - Guess Who
"This game isn't old-school or classic, but i'm sure this FPS going to be a Good-Old-Game. Why? Here's the receipt for this: -Take a good FPS game. [check] -Take a wise idea and give the game for no-price. [check] -Take a good community. [check] Mix it up and voila! Now you have a legendary game. So what can you do now? Here is my advice for ya step by step: 1st step: Download it! 2nd step: Install it! 3rd step: Play and enjoy it! 4th step: Take some brake! 5th step: Repeate from the 3rd step!"
"This Game is Awesome, You get hats, Throw ♥♥♥♥ (something i've always wanted to do) eat sandwichs, and blow dudes up"
"This game... many nerds, 10/10 would kill nerds again"
"In my opinion, THE BEST free to play game on Steam available from what I've seen. If you love FPS's, you will love TF2. If you love a mix of strategy and classed-based combat, you'll love TF2. If you like comedy and goofiness influenced in gameplay, you'll love TF2. And if you like hats, well, you get the point.   But truthfully, this is an amazing game. I honestly don't know why it's free, because it deserves to be a pay-to-play game. And another thing, my laptop is probably around 5 or 6 years old, and I'll be honest, not the best. But when I first launched it, it acted like it was nothing...high quality, too. So you really don't have to worry about it lagging so much, at least from your computer. Still depends on your connection to play multiplayer, of course. And if it is laggy on your computer, it was free anyways, all you have to do is delete it. But that should'nt be necessary.   I'd actually play this game instead of any Call of Duty game anyday. Really you have to at least give it a try. My personal rating, 10/10. Hope you guys enjoy the game as much as I am!!  "
"Team Fortress 2 is an amazing game downloaded it a while ago and never got round to playing it due to school exams, love the graphics, content and items. Would recommend to anyone to try out and have some fun."
If you want some fun play this ;)
"This is awesome.. just awesome...  First of all, it's f2p and many awesome and unique servers, like deathrun, freak fortress, slender fortress, parkour and many others. Just try it and you won't regret it!"
"What a good game, I played it and I like the gibus"
&gt;be on trade server &gt;10 year olds arguing over who has better inventory  &gt;argue for 3 hours &gt;good luagh  10/10 good times
Free fun time. And worth investing a few bucks for new weapons :D
Awsome
"Arguably the best game online, free, most played game on steam and it has a great community. What is there not to like. Well, the whiny kids are pretty annoying I guess xD"
"'free'    I'm just joking, but seriously. If you really want to enjoy this game on the fullest you have to buy ingame items to actually get into this game. Overall the gameplay is great, also the characters have their own story to tell. If there is a character that you like to play, then Team Fortress is just the game for you! Hop in and choose a character of your liking, sadly as I said in the previous lines.. The cosmetic items are sometimes really expensive, so loosen up your wallet a bit!  Good points:  -Dynamic gameplay -Easy going and fast learning -Fun with friends -a wild variation of weapons to choose of!  Meh points: -Not as free as they telling you -A very annoying kick-system -Alot of trade requests"
"Awesome game if you can shoot peoples heads off, i recommend this game"
I totally recommend this game it has gotta be the most fun game ive ever played 
My friends and I call this game our 'diamond in the ruff' because dog.
I don't know what there is to say about this game other then HATS!
Almost 600 hours on this.... omg
team fortrees 2 is awesome
Its ok
No doubt this is the gratest game ever made.TF2=Steam economy
this game's pretty tight.
I feel this game would be far greater if we could have some sort of headwear we could change out depending on how we feel.
"That game is SO FREAKING AWESOME. You can ♥♥♥♥ off people (literally), backstab, burn, shoot and almost anything else. And! This is only modern game, where rocketjumping is fun and useful. Definitely must have.  Two things that game lacks: chainsaw and Molotov. There still katana and minigun though."
Wasted All my Money 11/10
"Ive played the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game but for some people 500 hours is nothing. TF2 is a awesome FPS that is very different from most, for the reason of it being pretty comical and a cartoony style which makes it so great. Why i love this game so much is the community of all the weapons you can collect and the hats you get to show whos inventory as the most vaule. The maps people create are amazing when i comes to achievement idle or trading maps or just plain goofing off in a mingame based TF2 Ware this game never gets old. Hell the real best part is ITS FREE! so no reason not to get it."
"Rich, gorgeous and endlessly fun."
"I love this game, it is so much fun, when I watch the Trailer at I thought the game was Third Person view. This game is so much fun, I found lots of item and more."
"This is certainly the billionth recommendation for TF2 ever made, most likely. If you need one word to sum up the game: Hats. Need another? Fun.  This certainly is a top favorite game of mine for a good reason, and that it's just too much fun. Really, I can say it's one of the best, if not the best, free-to-play game out there, and that's not doing the game much justice. The game has multiple objective-based modes inplemented into a truckload of maps that have been either made by Valve or the community, and contains a pretty deep metagame thanks to the amount of weapons placed in the game and the varying ways that people play each class. Each match may play differently from the last, considering that everyone's going to play differently, which requires you and your team to adapt to survive.  Oh, I mentioned it has hats, didn't I? Yeah, think of this as Valve's way of earning money, along with some of the community members who contribute to the game. i really like this system, as you can customize each class however you want to, and it's a way to give back to the community.  I could go on about how this is one of the greatest games ever made, but you're probably sick of me rambling on about this game, by this point. And of course, you're already playing this game on some sort of time basis if you're on my friends list, so I guess I'm just talking to myself. I'll shut up and let you get back to playing now XD"
Great game 10/10 would almost always recommend
"Preety awesome game , developing lots of reflexes! A must for a Steam Player!"
This game may be free to play. But it does free to play right. No gems or time limits on guns or classes. every single item is possible to obtain without a special currency. And most of all you NEVER need to buy anything. You can buy things if you are impatiant to find a weapon but you never NEED to. I would rate thise game easily a 10/10 it is an amazing shooter. And teamwork is actually in this fun class based FPS. Looking at you Battle *COUGH* field. Anyway if you are looking for some fast paced action and buckets of fun. This is the game for you my friend.
I recommend that you should install and play this game :) Just don't play too much. :D
one of the best FPS games i've ever palyed
Spent 12 matches only trading hats  1337/10
"Is good, am play a lot, and is good fun time play it."
"Team Fortress Two Is a very Addicting FPS that will have you playing the game untill your power runs out/ internet cuts or fall asleep, endless fun. The Taunts and additional cosmetics makes your character unuiqe (can't spell). I recommend this game to those who need to waste time fast or play with ya' mates"
"Alright, listen up. I may be a conjurer of evil moons and spawner of children's nightmares, but I have something to say. This game is a good game in general. You know, violence, murder, hat simulation... wait, what? I'll get to that later. Anyway, ever since the game became Free-to-Play (which I shouldn't be saying this because thats how i got into the game), little children and C.O.D Fanboys/Fangirls came in and ruined the game as we knew it. Those who already own the game, think about it. Whining 7 year olds, tryhards, servers dedicated... DEDICATED... to idling and getting pointless (and sometimes not so pointless) items... are you KIDDING ME? Valve has made a huge mistake here. Stupidity at its finest, people. Now, don't get me wrong. I like this game, not just because of the hat simulation. The 9 classes all have unique personalities witha variety of weapons, which the collection of the weapons is slowly building up. The End of the Line update is coming soon, and I hope to Talos that they don't ♥♥♥♥ up this one. After the Love and War Update, the game's tables have been turned. Remember the whole hat simulation thing? Yeah. They added 40 new hats and other cosmetics in this update, along with only 5 weapons. Also, about 14 taunts. Valve, I just hpe you can get rid of all of these little kids begging for Keys, because everyone is tired of them. Now, about the actual gameplay. The gameplay itself is pretty nice, but some of the people playing are not. There are tryhards, whining kids and just plain idiots who join some servers. But if you like competitive play, then you'll like it. The 9 classes have a variety of tools in their arsenal to bring your team to victory.  I like this game. Nuff said. Feel free to dislike this, for it turned out to be a humongous rant about little children. Thank you for your consideration."
An incredibly balanced FPS with absolutely tons of replayability. It's a great game to play!
TO ADDICTIVE TO STOP!!!
A pretty rad game.
"Don't ask, just play it. Awesome!"
Team Fortress 2 is good and nice  he game suport on togethere   Thank you All!
"This game is an average shoot-em-up. However, the cartoony style, ragdolls, and gibs give it a funny atmosphere. 10/10"
I like this game for not being just a basic FPS (First Person Shooter) like COD (Call of Duty) its more of a puzzle shooter. Why I think it is more of a puzzle shooter is because each class has its weakness and the other class help their weaknesses.
This game is dank :^)
This game took my life away.   Thanks Gaben.   110000000/10
"Team Fortress 2 is a team based game that focuses around 9 different classes working together to fight against another team. For a free to play game, it is quite good as you can customise your characters and get new weapons. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes to do something fun. :)"
best free to play game
"Team Fortress 2, or TF2, has truly earned it's way into my top 5 games list. With it's imaginitive characters, setting, gameplay, and features, make this game an absolute must-have for any fan of FPS games or steam members. The game has many game modes that never get old or boring. Along with the games array of classes, the game is always fresh and fun. Problems I encountered in other FPS games like Call of Duty are they never involve strategy or team building. In TF2 however, teamwork must be used in order to win, making it extremly fun and imersing to play with friends. Every class has a weaknes and strength, along with imitations and constrictions, that allow you to become accustomed to your own class and playing stradegy. This overall allows for a extremely fun gaming experience."
"This game isnt like COD or MW but its a team game (like in the game) and it is a verry big MMO that has many achivements, so many differnt items, countless mutiplayer servers, even a mode that allows you to play against robots. In all i highly recommend thid game"
Tf2 is easily the best online team based game I have ever played. I recomend this game to ALL players. It's a great game and you can have tons of fun staying up late with friends playing on this game.
I've had a lot of fun with this game
"Let me get this clear: THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!  As TFQW was the first one I played, that game showed me what multiplayer PC gaming was about, but when I was told about this; my life changed.  Permantly.  The audience that this game shows to shocked me, with its unique art style, modding community, competitive leagues, and a wide range of background story, and things to discover,  like idle servers.  I can truely say that this game is for everyone. Its great fun to play every once in a while, but if you get addicted, youll still have twice the fun you had a couple of months ago. This game offers so much at your disposal, including whacky items from other games, hats, and tools, you can make any kind of style you want.  Final verdict?  GET THIS GAME NOW IMMEDIATELY "
The best hat simulator around.
Wow. Only thing i can say about it!!!!!!!!!!
Gr8 Game Id r8 this an 8.8/8
Team fortress 2 is by far one of the best games i have ver played. although the game is free i have spent so much money on it buying weapons and other things like that. this game is very easy to get into and i hope you enjoy it as much as i do.
"Simply the most addictive and funniest free-to-play multiplayer title out there. The great community-made gamemodes as well as the regular updates and additions make sure that you'll never want to stop playing. Furthermore, its F2P-model is very interesting, because people get the possibility to share their handcrafted work for a fair amount of money. All in all, it's a game by players for the players."
"Not saying that this game isn't a money trap for anyone with a penny to spend, but this game is a money trap for anyone with a penny to spend. Instead of looking bland while you get killed, drop a good 400 dollars and you might have a few hats to wear while you get killed. I recommend."
I like this game. This game is good.
The best war-themed hat simulator I have ever played!
"Sick game, you definately want to play this, scratch that, you HAVE to."
best game ever  could improve the lag pervention though

hats and fun
I love this game!
"This game is SO ♥♥♥♥ING BAD.  ♥♥♥♥ FORTRESS OF POO. I bought this game fair and square, i want my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ money back, not a peice'a ♥♥♥♥ hat.  ♥♥♥♥in' ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥."
"Hand built a $950 computer to play this game with friends. Steam suckered me with its sweet sweet sales, and now I have 50 games, but this is why I came and where I stay."
"Truely an amazing game. Full of action, never gets old!"
"I'm just gonna make a short list to make things clear:  Pros: + It's not pay-to-win (unlockable weapons are sidegrades but almost no upgrades) + 9 very unique classes with extreme up- and downsides (if you wanna win, you need teamwork) + Since there are almost only sidegrades, they offer different playstyles to discover + Fast gameplay + Overall nice balance (Nothing is too overpowered) + A fun Coop-Mode ('Mann vs. Machine' - 6 players against waves of robot enemies) + Unique 60's comic-like style (Watch the trailers to get an idea of the games style) + Great humor (Character's voice lines, in-game news, item descriptions, ...) + A nice way to individualize your characters with cosmetic items (they dont affect the gameplay) + Still a lot of updates which include bugfixes, new cosmetic items, maps and weapons + Steam Workshop implementation (community items are actually often put into the game) + Nice competitive scene + Much game modification possible (custom skins, custom sounds, custom HUD... you know the drill, it's source engine) + Premium-Accounts don't bring any gameplay advantages + Long-time fun since theres much to discover  Cons: - Some unlocks are rather annoying - Some classes need much practice until you become effective for your team - Content upgrades often only bring new cosmetics, less maps and rarely weapons - Still lots of minor bugs which need to be fixed - Workshop is only for items but not maps   Some facts you should also know when you want to try specific weapons: * You gain items randomly when playing. It's a random amount which resets every Thursday. You usually 'find' weapons (you can also find cosmetic items, but only when you're premium). * If you wan't to try a specific weapon, try the the ingame shop and look out for a 'Test'-Button. Usually, you are able to test the weapon for some days. * If you want to have the weapon as your own item, play the game until you gain some random drops and use the trading system to trade for items with other people (People usually trade 2 random weapons with 1 specific weapon). * Don't buy weapons from the shop, it's horribly overpriced.   That's about it. If you like a fast teamwork-based online shooter, you will also like Team Fortress 2. Give it a shot and download it."
If this game dosn't define 'good' gaming then I don't know what does.
By far the best game i have ever played i love the detil on some of the guns and hats
The best free to play game out there
This game is amaizing! I need to buy it for all feautures.
"Great game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of fun in it. I've played TF2 for over 1,4k hours already, traded a lot in it (i've over 3k trades already) and i can tell u that this game is great. Now i don't play it at all but it simply got boring to me because i've played it exclusively for long time and any game gets boring when u play it and noting else. I score TF2 for 10/10 and recommend it to everybody."
It's amazing best multiplayer game!
Click here to write a recommendation to all your friends
"This game is the best free-to-play game I have played on PC ever, great graphics, clever maps and decent players, although there are a few squeaker brats that do tend to get annoying. It is free-to-play, and although there are in game transactions, you can run through 90 hours of gametime and not have to pay a single cent to have a lot of fun. The only real problems are the occasional few squeaker brats and the power of the computer your using."
It has hats. What more do you need?
in my opinion one of the best shooter game there is out there simply for the fact that it's wacky and fun and mostly filled with nonsense...an amazing game defenetely recommended for those searching for a challange or just for those searching for a fun game
its ok
  HATS! #hatsfordays   
This game is the greatest thing you will ever play in your life! Really good! 0/10
"Really amazing fun game. A great game for anyone to play, and not to mention its free!"

This game is super good and its free so have at it.
Team fortress 2 is a fun free to play game. I simply love it for all the unigue classes.
1800 Hours... Speaks for itself.
Team Fortress 2 is one of Valve's most successful games ever made. You can customize classes. It has alot of sick but hilarious humor to it. It has all kinds of gamemodes as well. Used to be $20 but now it's F2P A very fun game you should get.
"This game is like a leech. It slowly sucks the life-juice out of your body with every passing minute. Your funds will drop and you will be forced to eat soggy pieces of bread off of the ground as a source of nutrition. You will lose your religion, GabeN will become your love and your savior. Hats will become your only friends, as your real friends matter not.  Overall, I rate Hat Simulator 2 a 10/10, would waste life to ValvE again."
Tee ef too is da best hat trading simolator in da whorld
Everytime I boot this game up I play one game.  If i do not receive a hat in the time it takes to play one game I quit. One day the hat fairy will bestow her gifts upon me. One Day.
awsom game its my liffe
"Gr8 FPS if u discount the insolent children, brony sprays and brazillians"
"If you´re looking out for a funny war game. Team Fortress 2 is the right game for you! Everything in Team Fortress 2 is made out of fun! It´s a war game and you can craft weapons, and trade them. Veryyy funny!"
"Anyone looking for hours of fun your at the right place tf2 is a blast, meet new people get new weapons and also hats!!!! show of your awesomness with a hat or 2 or 5"

Terrific community game with plenty of opportunities to meet new people and have a great time. I recommend this game to almost everyone.  Is gud.
One of the most addictive games on Steam.
"This game has taken litterally 536+ Hours of my life, And i still want more. Awsome twist on the fps genre, I sinserly recommend to anyone looking for a good fps game outside of the norm. 11/10"
Unique game with 9 very different but essential classes
this game is so much fun and i will always give it a thumbs up!
"Team Fortress 2, after 7 years of its lifetime, still hosts a great community(Mostly) The grand feature of this game, is the classes. They all have something unique about them, comparing spy and sniper. Spy is more relaxed, mischivous(Is this how you spell it?) and a guy likes to **** with your head. Sniper is rude, curses WAY more than spy(Spy does say **** you occasionally) and even likes to mock the dead, charming. But theres more, their isn't just 'Pick sniper cause 360 No scopes(although a new weapon allows for this)' they all are handy in different situations, spy is great for sapping and destroying strong enemies behind enemy lines. Sniper is great for picking off the medic and engineers(Weirdly, sniper is a counter to engineer) Theres all unique playstyles in the game. But some might not be your cup of tea. Scout is fast moving. Soldier is strong and has high mobility. Pyro burns ****. Demoman blows up whatever the **** he sees. Heavy is tank nuff said. Engineer is the high intelligence defence builder. Medic is that most is the most helpful class on the front lines. Sniper stays back and shoots peoples heads off. Spy is the chaser or the chased. 9 different playstyles, but none of them might fit you. But we have someone to spice up the playstyles. Some weapons in TF2 can COMPLETELY change your playstyle. E.G the Air Strike encourgages you to rocket jump for that extra firing speed that is fast as Usain Bolt. Another E.G the B.A.S.E jumper encourages you to put on the Air Strike for soldier for extra damage and mobility.  Overall a 10/10 but does lack in major updates, but that dosen't matter as they change up the game most of the minor ones."
"boring as ♥♥♥♥, useless updates (like asteroid map), community in ruins"
the best free game i have played 
Nice game (Y)
"tf2 a great first person multiplayer shooter with unlockable weapons 9 classes scout,medic,engineer,demoman,spy,pyro,solider,heavy,sniper good game unlockables for each character also miscs and other cool stuff such as hats so yeah i recomend tf2 its free to play on the steam store..."
This game is AWESOME!!! I can play it for hours!!! Thanks to Valve
Do I really need to say anything?
"As a person who enjoys hats, this is the game for me. 10/10 hat connoisseurs would play."
One of the best free games I've ever played because its fun and online xD
"Exciting, Fun to play with friends, and mostly Addicting. New updates to keep you coming back for more every single day. Hundreds of items to collect including hats, new weapons to use, and clothes for your characters. Enormous community with fluent and fun gameplay."
its awesome
"'Gentlemen?'  Team Fortress 2 is a fast-paced skill-based first person shooter with team oriented objectives and nine classes to choose from, which each has their own up- and downsides.  The Gameplay is fluent and full of action. It has been long since i did not find at least one server with up to twenty people on it. And because TF2 is Free-To-Play, new players join the forces of the greatest game of all time every day :).  Although there are some points which can really be said are not that inviting about TF2. It is not your typical US-Army shooter where enemies die in one hit. There are instances where this might happen (F.e. Crits), but it generally takes at least two hits, giving everyone a fair chance to react. And the more experienced players, though most of them are pretty funny, tend to abuse the lack of knowledge from newcomers. I found myself raging over a Scout killing me as a Heavy without getting damaged by me at all. But as time went on, I figured out how to really play the game and to enjoy it.  And TF2 really is a game, its competetive aspects aside, that is mostly to be played just to have a good time. (Example: Some 'Pro' Players might stop shooting you if you use the right voice command or something like that. I have made many 'Friendships over Games' by that ;P)  So, all in all, Team Fortress is a tough game to get to know and play, to learn the mechanics of all classes, gamemodes and such. But my advice is, that skill comes from practice. If you train hard and never give up, then you are granted access to the most fun game where you shoot people in the face :D  That said, you should immediately download it. It will be absolutely 'Worth the weight.'"
This game is basically the best FPS game i have ever played.
"TEAM FORTRESS 2- The best team-based multiplayer ever, that has diffrent classes to choose from, very fun and addicting, the best part is that you play a multiplayer mode call SURF only can be find on a dedicated server, very fun and you will love surf maps a lot more :)"
I love this game 
"if you like FPS, and are not a CoD fanboy, than this is the Game for you. This game has creative and funny characters/classes. this game also has a lot weapons, hats, gamemodes, ect. I suggest you play this game, this review is really crappy, but it will do."
Awesomeness in a nutshell
"Ever look up in the sky and think, ' God, why haven't humans made a game where you can be a all American, kinda dull, hat hoading, rocketlauncher toting, roomates with a wizard kind of guy, and many more, swimming in a pool of slightly sharp metal and his own hats?' Well, you can stop praying now, because of this rock paper scizzors playing, conga line dancing, sometimes shooting game! THIS IS....... HAT SIMULATOR 2007-2014!!!!"
"HOLY ♥♥♥♥ IT'S TEAM FORTRESS LOOK AT THIS ♥♥♥♥ SCOUTS AND HEAVIES AND SNIPERS AND ALL THAT STUFF GUNS? WE HAVE GUNS. BASEBALLS? THOSE TOO. YOU WANT SOME STUPID ♥♥♥♥ING PREDATOR MISSILES? ♥♥♥♥ OFF AND GO PLAY YOUR LITTLE BROTHER'S CALL OF DUTY, YOU LUMP OF CRAB FECES. THIS GAME IS SO FUN YOU'LL BE ERECTING A DISPENSER; IN YOUR PANTS"
Team Fortress 2  1. Download it 2. play it 3. enjoy it 4. say goodbye to your life  11/10 
Perfectly Game based on fast pace action :) Recommended for everyone 10/10 (except 4 year old toddlers xD) 
THE BEST GAME EVER
How can such a game not be liked? It is an inhuman feat to turn down such a marvel. (That's Free!)
Fun and Addictive
"We all know how reviews turn out to be in Team Fortress 2. Well, if I have to be honest from my experience, It was a great game back in the days... Do not get me wrong, it is still a great game though.  But after how things have changed throughout the years, Team Fortress 2 is all about hats and economy.  Any public servers are not always fun to play on your own when you have to carry your team all the time. Plus, do not expect to see any Medics on your team either as there will be more Snipers, Spies and Scouts. (May the luck be with you~)  And then there is random crits... Ugh...  This is just what I dislike but if you only care about having fun playing the game then do not let this bother you. But still, I will recommend to play Team Fortress 2 with your friends as it will make your gaming experience much more enjoyable."
An awesome game with an awesome economy. A bit too adictive :D
"It's a really really REALLY fun and adictive game, highly recommend it. 10/10 -_-"
Very good game and it is a good game that is easy to get used to when you first start and then the more you play the more the game changes.
Is good. Very fun.
Just play the game and you'll get used to it.
"Ah TF2, what can I really say? It's un-calm atmosphere, variety of characters, and it's crazy references.I really like the spy class and I get better at it every day. One of the only things I truly dislike about this game, is the Mann Co. Prices. Its like 7$ for a hat. A HAT! But overall the gameplay, music, weapons, is great. 9/10 game."
Very good game. Free.
"This game is great for if you are looking for a team based game. From Medics that can heal your team, to spies that can cloak and disguise as a member of the oppisite team, to the wacky and wide variety of weapons you have at your disposal, this game never gets old. On top of that, there is a large community behind this. An, although broken, economy, and much more. Also, hats. If you are worried about if your computer can't handle this, my 1 year old windows laptop can handle this game on the highest graphics with more then playable frames per second. This game is also not very serious, which, depending on your taste, is a great way of bringing humor to this game. This game gets constant updates with new weapons, features, cosmetics, and sometimes maps. On top of this, you can play this game free of charge!  However, the downsides are that this game requires you to buy something off of the in game store in order to expand your storage, you also can't trade until you buy something off the store. This may be a problem for some people that are having a hard time with their money at the moment. This game isn't the most balanced, either. This is mostly due to the wide variety of weapons that are avaliable. Overall, this game is the best FPS i have played in a while, and the only game i have been playing for some time. I highly reccomend this to anyone that is a fan of FPS games."
=i was 9 years old =its funny =its a hobby(to have hats:D) =and a very nice game~
This game is awesome and its free to play. that is all
Play so much I play it in my sleep...10/10 FUN!!!!
"I recommend this game,is very good ..."
best game (in my opinion) ever!!!
"Some features I like in this game are how the game can be played in an either independent or team dependent base way and/or team base with unlock able weapons, taunts, cosmetics,items, among other things. Though people joke about this game and how 'op' some set ups are or how 'meta' some items are or how much their hat is worth(#HatFortress2) in the end of the day it's all up to how you play and if you had fun."
"Team Fortress 2 a wonderful game of fashon and bloody merder also its multiplayer. Do you like gore or death ,violence, then this is the game for you. It has death, dominations, merder, gore, mini guns, rocket launchers, flame throwers, and much more exiting features for you to explor. Now it is a kiling/fashon game but who cares right its a brilient game! If you like exploding people, first person shooter, sneaking dodging being nice or just the top guy then i recomend this game to THE WHOLE INTERNET!"
"An amazing game, me and my friends cant stop playing it."
"Yes I do recommend this game. So fun, everytime I play it, im rminded how funny, fun and serious it can be. Its amazing. Definitely i'd recommend. At start you'll suck... Most of the time. With time you'll be a machine to be reckoned with. There are also the hats to show of how much you've wasted time trading or playing TF2. Teamwork is an important part. Sometimes I wonder will it ever die. I always convince myself it wont die down till some more years to come bieng supported by the tf2 community."
team fortress 2 is my life i play it 24/7 best game you can play some bad mostly good! try playing it its free - PMCsmoker
1. Download Tf2 2. Instantly spend $50 on mann. co store 3. Realise i could have got those same hats for 50 cents 4. Go on trade server 5. 4 year olds screaming hentai at each other 6. ??? 7. Overused joke is overused 8. Profit 9. Get free items for having a girly username again.  girl/10 would girl again
I really like the fact that there are 9 different classes to play. each one is unique and has a different personality. One thing is lag though it will lag sometimes but it happens rarely. overall its a 10/10!
"Can't stop, won't stop. I am addicted to this game!!"
This game is very nice!
This game is awesome. It has a good community with little to no scammers. People will help you out if your having trouble. This game is funny too.
"Tl:Dr- Great game that has little to no downsides, not Pay to Win/Play and it's free.   As a Member who has spent over 1100Hours, (Removed account so I Made this one) I can say this is one of the Greatest games out there! It's so addictive to buy things from the Store. For example. You just got that new unusual hat from your Mann Co. Crate which you bought with a Mann Co. key and now your the top of the line, high end, MLG swagmaster, All the 6-15 Year old F2P's will bow to you asking in chat to stop, as you dominate them into abliteration with your New Factory New Gun Mettel Sniper Rifle which you had unboxed during the Gun Mettle Update (Or bought from the Market). For over 200 different weapons in the game (Not including Skins) I would have to say this is one of the best game ever, To an addition gameplay is amazing and very balanced as said before, and It's by Valve! Lord Gaben gives you a free game! Price of nothing and it's the best one out there. And who doesn't love Steam/Valve?   The only problem that I have seen so far about this game is in MvM most people are really Rude, which isn't normal for the TF2 community. But they want you to do certain things even if you arn't a F2P. (Pro Tip: F2P's get picked on a Lot, Cheapest item in game is around .99 Cents USD, Use a website thats able to track how much an item is worth in Refined metal buy it on Mann Co. Store and sell it for Refined Metal, Or Keys if its worth that much.) But besides these issues I would Rate it a 10/10. Thanks for such a Great game Valve.  -Amethyst"
THIS GAME IS AWSOME ♥♥♥♥♥ES
it is great and includes great team tactics
hats
"Where do I start on this game? I've spent around 900 hours on it and still feel like I'm barely started. By far, it's the best FPS I've ever played, from gameplay to community. Would definitely reccomend it to literally anybody - it's hard to NOT enjoy it."
Badass game that's ruining peoples lives..... Murica.
I enjoy a game that allows me to sit in one spot and kill 10 people without dying and doing a perfect 450 dmg on any shot.
"amazing game, oasama bin liftin approves 99/10 NGI - not bad"
"GAH!! This game is total GARBAGE! I mean jeez, sucking away 1500 hours of my life?! UGH! IVE ONLY MADE AWESOME FRIENDS FROM IT I MEAN, COME ON!  oh, by the way, play it. You WILL enjoy it."
BEST MULTY/COOP GAME FOR THE PC OF ALL TIMES!!!!! :3
"Personally I love the things you can do in this game. There are no set rules. You can do whatever you want, whenever you want, for any reason you want. It can go from a gut-busting time of being goofy, to a serious mow down of everybody that gets in your way. That's personally why I love this game. I can have a good time ith my friends, or work on my skills alone. I don't plan to go anywhere, and am already looking forward to the next update."
Nicely balanced fps game. I cant stop playing!
"This game is one of my favorite games in Steam. Because it's easy to learn, and is very fun. The classes are also a great part of TF2 because it adds lots of variety. Which makes this game so fun. If you have't yet played it ,I recommend playing it. :D"
Great Game
hat simulator is best simulator
"The game is really good , played tf2 for a while now ,"
"i love this game this is truly a game of art it's one of the most creative games I've played in a long time creative players, different aspects, different weps, and you can customize your character this is the best game ever please don't take this game down EVER!!!"
Ignore this :3
this is a really fun game. i dont know why cod players dislike this game 
"This is how Free to Play should be judged, Valve has perfected Free to Play as a model without trying. A superb shooter, it was worth every penny before the change to free to play and now it is: It deserves your time."
"Trust me, you can't resist it! It's the best game I have ever played. I really like because of it's colorful style, funny voices and classes and the BEAUTIFUL HATS! I play it LITERALLY everyday but it is so worth it! I really recommend you playing this game if you like colorful and funny games like this! I'll sure give it 10/10!"
This Is 1 of the most fav game that i played during this whole life!
"All I can say is: Get it, get it now! This class based game is my favourite game and I believe nothing will top this. This game is one of the most balanced games in the gaming industry. I've got to give valve some credit for this since there are over 50 weapons and keeping them all balanced takes effort. All nine classes in this game have their own little quirky personalities and thier own purpose on the battlefield of Dustbowl. This game will never cease to amaze you. Oh, and also, HATS!"
its a good game that is all
"Fun Games, You Should Play This Games"
A Great Game to play!!!!! I rly like it ! everyone should play it c:
"It is a very fun arcade shooter, didn't think i'd like it at first but now i love it."
Addicting
i like team Fortress 2 because all the hats and weapons and more.
"Fun, addicting game for many people. From pushing carts to stealing intelligences, try to be the best of your team. Also includes custom servers people make today, that you can join with your friends. I recommend this game for people who love FPS!"
"This is without a doubt the best game Valve has ever done, F**K Half Life and Counter Strike THIS IS THE S**T!(before you ask i do like Half Life and Counter Strike).  Do you like First Person Shotters? GET IT! Are you tired of the all the mediocre 'Military Shotters' like Call of Duty`? GET IT! Looking for a Good Game that will suck your life away?! GET IT! ???????? GET IT!  EDIT: Oh yeah and its free to play! This is definently a game worth your time!"
"Simply the greatest F2P game ever made. The gameplay is intense &amp; awesome fun, the class balance is impeccable &amp; the items give you infinite replayability. Prime example of easy to learn, hard to master."
ITS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great game very great game. 
10/10 would hat simulate again
"I have played TF2 for about 13 hrs so far and honestly it is a cool game, but sometimes you meet the spawncampers and the people who make the game SUCK. But as long as you don't have to deal with those I bet that you will enjoy the game Best class to start out with?, depends on what you like to do, can you be sneaky, then be a spy, do you like healing, then be a medic. Just warning you, if you think you saw someone else with the same name as the guy next to you most likely you have a spy on ur hands"
I LOVE THIS GAME!
team fortress 2 is the best muitiplayer game that valve made
"I think everything positive about this game that needs to be said, has been said. Regardless, I feel a need to upvote it for all the good times it's given me. It's one of those games you should probably play at least once in your life."
"A game that is worth downloading is defenatley this one. Normally I would expect a game like this to have a pricey cost but this is free to play. This game is a stardigizing, sort of fast, contains some comedy, don't rage quit, and be epic. There is alot of basics and theries to over view but it is fun. This game consists of in-game purchases and nine classes. Offense - Scout Soldier Pyro | Defense - Demoman Heavy Engineer | Support - Sniper Medic Spy Some Classes are difficult to get started with, but soon you'll thank Valve for creating all of this. Thanks for Reading This.  I highly recomend this game."
The perfect shooter its balanced(mostly) fun and not pay to win. Team fortress 2 is just a game I can't quit and no matter what it never gets boring. And its free why would you not get it.
this game is awesome
A very funny online shooter
I love this game recomend this to everyone best free to play game ive ever played
Almost everyone on steam has this game and for good reason its realy fun and free.
tf2 is epic you should get it there is so many modes that provide lots of fun you can kill anyone 
"Team Fortress 2, lovingly referred to as 'Hat Fortress 2', is the definitive MMOFPS. If you don't know about it, you must have been living under a rock AND a hard place at the same time. I have a hard time writing reviews about games that mean something to me. It's not too complicated that you can't learn it in a few hours, but it isn't self-explanatory either. All in all, TF2 is probably my all-time favorite Steam game in existence. The community is also amazing and very active in the game. Valve themselves takes some of the top-rated Workshop items and adds them in occasionally. It isn't played like the traditional FPS, however. Most FPS games put you in the role of 'Expendable Scrub #2258,' but in TF2, you take the role of one of NINE Expendable Scrubs! Each one drastically different from the last. From the fleet-footed Scout, to the walking Russian tank, the Heavy, to the Not-a-Nazi mad German doctor, the Medic, to the ♥♥♥♥-lobbing Sniper. Your years of CoD and Halo won't help you here, friend. I gladly give this game a 10/10. A massively enjoyable experience for the most hardcore and adaptable FPS players out there! But wait, I'm not done yet! It... has hats. Yeah, that's right. HATS! Possibly the greatest addition to a game ever, and until you have one, you will NEVER understand! And with that, I give it a final score of 10/10, and a personal score of 11/10 because hats push it one step further."
Tf2 i think is so COOL
"This War Themed Hat Simulator is A fun, fast paced, objective based game. push a payload, capture a briefcase, hold a point, or derp around. in Team Fortress 2 there are 9 classes, the scout, the soldier, the pyro, the demoman, the heavy, the engineer, the medic, the sniper, and the spy. Run around, and shoot everything that moves. oh yeah, there's also hats.  Rating 10/10 perfect game."
Team Fortress 2 is undoubtedly the best online hat simulator in the world.
"Possibly one of the best Valve games of all time in my opinion. Considering I've played 11, (Portal, Portal 2, TF2, Half Life, Half Life 2, Half Life 2 Episode 1, Half Life Deathmatch Source, Half Life 2 Deathmatch, Half Life 2 Lost Coast, Left 4 Dead 2, Dota 2) my opinion is probably fairly trustworthy."
Oh my god....... 500+ hours spent on this game....... WORTH IT.
This is definitely my favorite out of all video games out there...the fun....the moments....and of course the awesome and hilarious things u can see and experience on this game....I love everything on this game! Keep the awesome updates going!
this is the funist game in the world...
Very fun game and it's free so why not :)
great game online has much more than offline practice mode and even has slender for those who enjoy horror aspects of games
"This game is amazing! The graphics are good, and amazing for playing with your friends. Best 1st person shooter game ever!"
"This game is sick, because, its a FPS and its cartoon aspect makes it even more fun, with a large community and easy controlls, this game can't get better."
never knew how arousing hats could be until i played this game.
i would never know this game without Ezar
Most AWEOSME GAME SO ADDICTED LOVE TF2
Lots of acheivements and stuff that is fun simple :D 
"It's free, has a lot of content, funny community and packs a ton of fun! What's not to like?"
Get it. Now. Don't ask questions just do it. What's that? You don't want it? Get it anyway. Everyone else on steam does. Don't be a loner. It's free. What are you waiting for? Get it right now and give me a hat.
"Ok, here is a more suitable rating.   I give this game Five stars (going with star rating system as I'm not very familiar with any other ones lol)  Variety: There's pleanty of classes, maps, weapons, modes -heck, there's even plenty hats to choose from. One thing I can state is that this game has variety, the games popularity shouldn't be a mystery to any of the players.   Simplicity: The characters are full of personality, though some players not be quite sure of the plot as there really isn't one we all know our objective as when we select a match we are told what map and such we'll be joining when it is loading (even if it is the random choice that you selected). Interface is pretty direct, and takes minutes to get used to. HUD is also pretty polished, you don't have to keep your eyes at the bottom of the screen anymore with tf2, unlike most games in which your health bar is at the bottom. The reason as to why I feel the TF2 health bar is neat is because it's easy to tell whether or not you're low on health as the square will turn red, also that it is within your peripheral vision (which means yes you don't have to look at the bottom of the screen as previously stated) Every class has 3 weapons (engineer/spy are exceptional as they only have 2-3 weapons with 5 slots) primary/secondary/melee, a simple set up we can all get used to pretty quick.  This might sound a bit silly, but even the names are simple. They range from 1-3 syllables and are fairly short, so it's easier to describe say you saw a few sticky bombs in base in CTF you could simply type 'demo in base' rather than 'xxxxxxxxxx in yyyyy' in which is a problem in some games because some people are slow typers, but well knowing the average steam user you're probably going to be a fast typer so that's not going to be a problem for you.  Other: Modding is available, it's a bit more complicated than going to workshop and clicking 'subscribe' on any item you see as appealing, for modifications you have to go to a third party site- however, installing them even on a third party site is pretty simple. you just drag and drop them into a folder and I guess you could say thats another thumbs up seeing as lots of people like to personalize their stuff (me personally I don't do this with TF2 but others might).   Community: You're alright. I've chuckled at the banter over hats, even though you all made fun of my gibus when I first started playing.   I would add more at the moment, I sure think there's more to mention but I can't think of anything. I spent most of this year playing this game (I've played more on my alternate account than this one) and I don't regret it either. I've also spent a bit more than time on this game... lmao"
Great Game! Free to play and super addicting. More fun with friends. And the drop system is well put together were you dont get too much or too little.
"A great game, if not for its general replay value, then for the exciting personalities and circumstances afforded to each character. As opposed to simply playing 'Soldier X' or 'Survivor Y', you're controlling a specialized class complete with an identifiable appearance and unique characterized voice casting. I purchased this game a few years ago, unfortunately a very short time before it went free-to-play, but I do not remotely regret having paid for such an entertaining game.  Aside from some revised classic FPS game modes, the modding/hosting communities present about the game offer a large range of alternative modes (Survival, Versus Saxton Hale and WarioWare to name a few) that bring an expansive, ever-growing catalogue of play styles to your game.  The commercial aspect of the game is primarily aesthetic (you've probably heard the hat jokes), and is in no way necessary to augment your ground against other players. There are numerous weapons with traits that will allow you to customize the way you play your classes, but even the base weapons can achieve great things when weilded by an experienced player.  There are also back-stories via comics, cinematic videos and seasonal events for people who are into that sort of thing.  Overall, a fantastic game. I can only advise you use the official servers primarily for practice and explore others as you progress, since the quality of people you tend to find (F2P etc.) can become daunting.  "
Love this game 
this game awsome!
This game is so addicting and it is very fun if you are into (sometimes) intense offensive battles or defensive battles. The spy can be very useful if you need to get behind enemy lines.
"this game is possibly the most addicting free game that ever existed. there are 9 different classes (scout,soldier,engineer,spy,sniper,heavy,demoman,pyro, and medic.) in this game you have to find the one your best at and... KILL EVERY DAMN PERSON YOU SEE!!!!!! HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  this is my review,  ~The Ambassador"
This game Ruined my Life. Awesome game.
I've played different versions of Team fortress for over a decade now. Still love it
The most addictive hat simulator I've ever played. The shooting can be fun too.
hi this is my review on team for- PHLOG FORCE OF NATURE RESERVE SHOOTER MACHINA STICKYSPAM HEAVY MINI SENTRY ENFORCER DIRECT CRIT bye
Its a good game:D
"Man, this could be renamed Hat Simulator and it would be the same thing.  Even though I don't play it much and I'm not even skilled at it, I love this game. You can get killed by being slapped with a fish. You can waste 100 dollars on a digital ring. You can kill robots that run on money. But most importantly, hats.  10/10 hats."
"Best game on steam, and its free!"
really great game i love it never could ask for more!!! thanks Gabe newell
If you like fast pased fps this is the game for you &lt;3
worst game i've ever played and i've played super monkey balls
Veri nice free to play game
Good and nice game=3! 
Well i do recommend this game to everyone. Well to ages to 16 and older im guessing 
Pretty hillarious gameplay. Many hats and accessories to aqquire! Not pay-to win which is fantastic. Free to plays have the same chance of doing well as paid players. Loads of game-modes and different servers to choose from. Takes about an hour to learn how to use all the characters but months of practice to master them. It's not my favorite game but for those who love FPS match-games totally go for it. 8/10
"Great game, it happens to turn into a fps, hat simulator, but besides that, it's a great game with somewhat balanced mechanisms."
"This Game is such a great Online game and Co-op when you want to play with friends. Plus this game is free to play, I recommend this game because it's fun and you can trade with other people and cool items and use them in-game."
i luv this game its my bae in the 411 dank in the bank with my homies sittin on our bottoms because that is how humans evolved
I love this game...
This game is badass 
"Great game, highly addictive. Offers many servers and quite a few different gameplay options. Their way of making sure both teams are fair is remarkable, and allows for players to vote on certain things which gives players some control. Not really any hackers. This game is super fun and it's worth it to download and give it a try."
"It can be a really fun game, despite the fact that it can be a pay-to-win game. Also, it has some language, but excluding that, I think it is a great game!"
fun werid fps crazy fp2 game just so fun mmo lots of good stuff just try it
why is this the best game on steam and free.
Great game.
This game is most epic game ever... U must try this
good game and good friends and good time thx tf2
"It's TF2, I'm pretty sure everyone has heard of this legend of a game by now. 600 hours in and I've not been bored once. 9 different gamemodes, hundreds of hats and weapons, countless maps, extremely community based, and has an open workshop where players can create items to have a chance to have them in the game. This game has it all, and to top it off, it's free to play."
O my god!!! Super-Duper Game!!!!
This game makes me happy................................. fin
"Do you like spending over 100 dollars on a virtual ring you can't even wear? Or 10,000 dollars on a stupid hat with a newspaper in it that was lit on fire? Or 3,500 dollars on a dead person inside of a coffin that you used to get out of a small, 4x4 compact crate that comes with a skull from Five Nights at Freddy's following you around? Or 2,000 dollars for a haircut that makes you look like a crazy, sadistic punk rocker that recently came from Chernobyl? Or 5,500 dollars for the fire hazard named the Sorting Hat from Harry Potter with a demonic face that got lit on fire? Or 928 dollars for a gigantic, burning fish that does nothing but leech off of your brain tissue while you mindlessly slaughter others? Or 200 dollars for a satanic Christmas tree that you can wear? Or maybe even the grandest deal of them all, a Frying Pan or a Wrench painted in pure gold in exchange for your house, your car, and your virginity? This is for you! I still reccomend buying spinach with the money instead."
"I have played over 450+ hours of TF2. I have had so much fun, My friends are awesome. There will be the noobs that want to ask for stranges then pay in reg weps. The scammers, but no hackers. I think if you have not downloaded this, you should do i right now."
"A really great fps game, fun and interesting"
"It's TF2, enough said."
only game that rewards players for being bad at it
"Just as good as Gmod, if you dont have it, GET IT. "
Play if you like some hats
i was offered a hat with bread on it for a shovel bread/10 would bread again
"A comical First-Person Shooter, Team Fortress 2 comes right into the top few games in anyone's library. Shoot stuff. Blow up stuff. Sometimes even burn stuff - and progressively get better at it all.   If you're the sort of person who likes to shoot other people online, then I see no viable reason that this could NOT be a perfect game for you.  If you're a clever tactician, several in-game gimmicks and combos exist to aid you into better combat. That's what I enjoy the most myself...  And even if you're a concientious objector, there's a peaceful protest sign with your name on it - literally. Uh... maybe the rest is better left unsaid...   All in all, a good and timelessly entertaining game - bring a friend or two along!"
"This is the best FTP game i have ever played! There is so much to do, no need to buy anything with real money if you dont want to. Everything can be crafted! All 9 classes are awesome. I never feel that one of them is too OP because you can always counter them. Once you mastered one class there is always more! If you master Scout, you can then start to master some else class or just dont master anything and still have a good time wiht this game. PvP mode works like it should, nothing special, just 7 differend game modes and some beta gamemodes, lots of maps and everyone is fun to play. there is also an PvE mode called MvM. Its supper fun with firends and some of them are hard.  To top it off, i like this game :)"
im doing this for the achievement
Amazing. Love this game. &lt;3
u click on people with hats
This is the most fun you can have in your life and i highly recommend it to anybody.
Circle of TF2:  Think you're good --&gt; see people with hats better than yours  /|\ |  | \|/  | Spend $money$ on better hats &lt;-- Think you're bad
Don't play this game unless you have a lot of money to burn.
Really good  it is practically a time killer. when you are bored you can play it
It's an awesome game
Its awesome

Good game to play but there will be annoying people on there
This game is Addictive   This game made me a Premium and Non-Limited Acc On Steam by Trading Started from Gifted Crates to Keys
"if you want to play games, play this game. it is best game"
Good Game!!! thx
This game is so fun.I been playing for 1 year now and I have many items.Look at my inventory.
it is one of the best games
^
I love it very much :-)
this is probs going to be a short review but i thing this game is worth playing if you put the time and efort into finding a server that you rather enjoy and are willing to put countlis hours on this game and just have fun with it im sure you'll like itand this is my point of view on the matter you may have your opinion but if you value mine but hate the game just give it time im sure it'll grow on you who knows?
"Very good game 10/10. I recommend this game it is very fun when playing with friends, you can still have fun by yourself though."
"You are good son. Real good, maybe even the best.     - Soldier"
This is a great hat simulator. With billions of hats to choose from u will never run out of possibility's. Having nine dress up dolls and so many combinations this will make u feel like ur actually wearing these hats. Theres also a shooting mini game but its very small and has barley any effort in it.
"Though TF2 has fame beyond many shooters, I still would give it a little praise here in this little review. Now you have to know that I am not a first person shooter type of gamer. Outside of TF2 my only other experiences are Wolfenstein 3D and Unreal Tournament, which I never even played multiplayer. However, TF2 has become my most played game ever, eating over 3000 hrs. of my life. It may be a bit on the downhill for me now, but it was a solid pick during my PhD.  The game's cartoonesque style and class based system make it so that even non-veterans can jump in and have enjoyment. I even managed to climb up the ranks a bit in competitive. What if you don't like to fight other people and just want to have some fun with friends? Jump into the game mode Man vs. Machine to have a unique 'tower defense' - like game. In short it has many different skill level and playstyle type of game modes to entertain a wide variety of players.  Besides, it is free to play and if you do not pay you get nearly the full game. What you get extra if you pay - even just a nickel is enough to get upgraded to 'premium' status - are nice extra's like trading. This is not necessary to play, however, and rarely are the first weapons you receive (or 'stock' weapons) downright outclassed by others - others weapons tend to have their own niches. Furthermore the community in general is friendly, so why don't you give it a try?"
"Is there really any reason you aren't playing this? You're on Steam, this game is basically a requirement to own. Just make sure to buy an item in the shop to become a premium member."
Keep calm &amp; trade hats!  When i've start playing this game - it was a funny cooperative-fps. Today it's just a free2play  wardrobe simulator 
"Ah, team fortress 2.   who couldnt love this title after all the content added and popularity it has across the globe. its fast paced and is so much fun to play with friends at almost any time.  over all, a great expeariance."
"Great, fun exciting game, where you have a variety of classes you can try from! Geat game overall and with friends!"
This is best game evar. I love this game&lt;3
"i recommend this game but, don't play it if you're 5 for the love of god T_T messes with my sleep BUT IDC I HAT SLEEP WOOHOO!!"
Very good! and for free
"The void for your wallet, saving up? Not anymore you need to open all thoes crates you have! Remember kids in the end Gabe always wins."
hdfbgiuaysgfiaysfhgusaiirgby ok thats good
This game is turning out to be one of the best Free-To-Play games I have ever played. The updates are amazing and so are the festive add-ons you get for Free! I would recommend this game to all who love FPS'
"Some say that the graphics are from comics, I think their great. So come on! It's one of the best multiplayer games ever and it's free!  Valve is the best!"
"Brotha Strika was on! Folks was friekin, tite me?  Translation: this game is really nice"
W + M1 = Quality entertainment
This Is The Best Trade Game Ever I Saw
"If you like a FPS that you can explode, burn, chop off heads or just fill some random body with bullets in a comical universe, Team Fortress II is a must play. If bored, you just sit, open this game and stay minutes or even hours and hours playing this."
I'd give the keys to my house for some keys to a box
"this game is fun and awesome , play this game!! its free!"
love this game! 
"OH MY GOD WHERE DO I START??? Well, let's just leave it at.... beats any call of duty or battlefield game. Its really really fun and I can bet you money that every single BarnBlitz game you play, you will not ee the same sandwich eating Heavy eapons Russian with a fedora or Scottish black guy holding up a beer! If you haven't already, you should pick up TeamFortress2!   Thanks for reading and if ou found this review helpful, please let me know!"
"awesome game I recromend for all players looking for a good first person shooter. Lots of different game modes like man vs machine, capture the falg to name a few. also there is a wide variety of hats and weapons for all clasees making it by far my favourite first person shooter so far, "
spend real money on virtual items conga conga conga  'maybe you should buy a better weapon at mann co'  -Saxton Hale
420/420
After so many years it is still addictive and fun to play
+10/10 Best game every good for trading just sitting there or just wanting to murder people this would be the game for you. :)
Its fun I Like collecting Guns And i like the commuuntiy its polite and not dirty 
"If you don't have TF2, then......*sigh*..... I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR WAITING FOR!!!!! Get TF2, it true, the hype. This is a must have for any PC gamer!"
Fun fps online game. If your looking to make money on a game this is a game for you. You can get items and you can either sell it or keep it. Valve always updates the game even with the special events!
"If you can't afford games like Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Or Counter Strike: Global Offesive, then this game is for you! Why you ask? Well its a great game overall, because its a cartoony shooter what more can ask? it's not like those games with fancy graphics like Tomb Raider, COD: Advanced warfare, Bioshock2, Portal2, Etc.  So I suggest you add this game to your library and give it a try :)"
"It's good or something, I don't know, haven't played much~"
"Hats, I got addicted to hats, I wanted more hats, but hats were never enough, I sell hats after long time playing, hats go to other person, I no hats. I buy games. I happy and not addicted to hats anymore."
Tf2 is a game that would make my top 20 best games of all times list it only has minor flaws but mostly amazing in terms of gameplay and its growing community and tons of weapons and especially 'HATS'.
My first game so many feelings :D TF2 is the reason why I joined Steam
This game came out of my dream

"team fort. has 9 different classes to choose from, all with there own special abilities. "
I really like dis game TRY IT I RECIMEND IT
This is a very good game.
"When you want to look nice, wear a hat. If you want to push in dustbowl, use the side tunnel. If you wanna blow up robots and save Mann Co., play some Mann Vs. Machine with friends. And if you wanna be in space, play some Asteroid."
Great
"Very good FPS game, every has their pros cons. You can 'get job' by trading stuff with other players, like in CSGO or DOTA2. I recommend to download it to everyone, and, if you can, buy the premium. It will be worth alll your spent money for it, trust me. :)"
Simply awesome...
Really awesome game!!!
i love this game.
one time i almost bought a weapo ammo   
by far this is one of the most thrilling and exciting games I have played keep up the good work
for over 600 hours i've played on this games it's pretty fun
very great and very fun! it's very amazing for a valve game!
Free to play yet i would still buy it if it wasnt. This is a must have!
"One of the most coolest F2P game i ever played it accepts low graphic card drivers,moddable"
without this my life is ruin        10/10
This game is so ♥♥♥♥ing nice!!!!
"Because of the game's unique classes and a multitude of different weapons available to each of them, there is a nice variety of ways to play TF2. You can definitely find a loadout that works for you and your play style. Hats are nice too!"
If you like fast paceed action and shooting people in the face this is the game for you. With a vareity of of different modes and intresting classes so far i havent gotten bored with collecting new weapons and sometimes frustratingly get the same weapon twice and a whole bunch of weird and fun servers you will enjoy TF2 alot
"For me, this game is fun, but I guess it didn't catch me like it did to some others. Maybe that'll change though idk. Good shooter: hats/10, oh did I mention there's hats? yeah there's hats"
If You Like Costumization and Guns Play this game I Love The Pyro And The Scout
Team Fortress 2 is relly a fun game to play so i recomend it. Trust me it's worth it!
this game must be the best ever
It's a nice game.The characters are good and the gameplay.AAnd you also can customize your characters with weapons and hats.I like this game

"If you have Steam and don't have this, you are literally silly."
game is fun but people are not
Great game 10/10 always great to play with your friends and even alone!
"This game, is one of my favorite games, and for a good reason. The game has so much variety, from being a little guy annoying people, to an undercover agent that can disguise as other people and the Fat guy who eats sandwiches and steaks while calling everyone babies."
10/10 best hat simulator out there
I did a 360° steam-check quickscope headshot. 420/69
Remember when you could just hop in in a server and have some good ol' fun? Yeah me too
Team Fortress 2 is better then both Call of Duty And Battlefield Combined
"This game is probably the best game I've ever played. It's confusing once you first play it, but it's very easy to learn. I guarantee you'll be hooked if you play this game for a little while."
It is a awsome game
"10/10 has hats, hackers, and little kids to troll around every corner. Well worth the $19.95 my friend sold it to me for ;D"
This game is so much fun and is really addicting! Try it out! Its probably the most fun you can have on Steam
Team Fortress 2 is a great co-op and multiplayer game. Its basically Cod but animated.
"Alota People think Overwatch is gonna make a ton of TF2 players switch, But in my opinion. Overwatch will most likely become boring in a matter of time after release..."
"The best game. the creativity, the hats, the weapons, or even the taunts. also thanks toplayers that also create new hats from the workshop. I must say, It is worth a wait after 9 years of development."
Awesome and fun game to play !
Very Fun Game to sum it up. Action is found everywhere.
"Probably my favorite game of all time, bunch of endless hours of shooting and fun :) it has an awesome trading and competitive community also :)  Best F2P Ever"
"Tf2 is a fun game to play with friends. I reccomend it to anybody who is just starting out on steam, because the only thing you have to pay for is trading. Ish gud gaem"
teamfortress 2 is about the most fun game ive played yet it comes in second after gmod
One of my favorite games of all time. I definently recommend this game.
"Ahhh, Team Fortess Duex; the famous game where you run around shooting at people and they shoot back. But the question is, who will survive?"
I love this game so much because It's so cool for my liking! I would recommend that lower than 7 or 6 years old should not play this as It has blood and all that. I would recommend people over 6 or 7 should really play this.
"The best hats simulator of world Oh, also a shooter mini game"
It's ok.
"Well yeah, Hat Fortress 2. Hats. Keys. Hats. Great game, great community just buy iy already. Oh wait, you don't have to. Completely Free to Play and you can enjoy the entire game without paying a cent."
great game
love this game
I mean come on! It's tf2! How can anybody not like this?! It's like an unserious better version of Call Of Duty(with CARTOON graphics!).
ive played this game for a combined total of 16 days.2 weeks.1 life wasted
I really love this game would never live without it.
The best
I like this game for what it is! Team based multi cast FPS strat game. I am Partial to the sniper as i am a fan of the long range kill. have been since team fortress 1. I would definantly recommend this game to all others.
It is fun. Yes.
This game is the best in my Steam list and I love it!
"If you are stupid, you will love this game. If you are mildly stupid, you will love this game. If you are normal, you will love this game. If you are slightly intelligent, you will love this game. If you are Einstein, you will love this game. If you hate this game, you cannot be described with words as such scum is highly undesired. Apart from that, you will love this game."
"Eh, it's ok."
"Aside from the fact that Tf2 is known as the hat simulator of the century, it truly is at heart a very fun first person shooter, weather your stomping pubs, messing around with a few good friends or just being an idiot in general, Tf2 really is a game that is worth your time and disk space"
Words can't describe how perfect this game is. 10/10
"This game can be an annoying mess at times, but it's mostly genuine fun. Lots of weapons to experiment with, maps, and gets updated alot. Plus, hats, aliens, gold weapons, robots, and tons more of wacky insane things. It's a good game, just play it."
"One of the best fighting games, I've ever played! It's like a cartoonish version of Counter Strike! And I love cartoonism, so this game is almost perfect for me! I love the cartoonish characters, the crazy cartoonish weapons, the maps, and even the storyline! I'm making a lot of friends in multiplayer mode!"
The only game were you can have fully grown men working as mercenaries; killing each other without end; dress like fairies and pink bunny rabbits.
Love this game! &lt;3  and there are hats!!! *-*
"This game is the best f2p first person shooter in my opinion. Almost all these years i've been playing this awesome game. First of all valve is growing super fast and they are getting peoples attention lately. I just hope Valve can grow even faster and spread across the world. Also Team Fortress 2 isn't just a war Blue team vs Red team.... You can taunt, play dodgeball, play deathrun and many more gamemodes that doesn't relate to war. Well that's all for now folks and have a good day :)  (Love this Game) :3  "
"This game is a very fun one. I have been playing for about a year and I have seen no problems with it, except for the excessive amount of hats. Other than that, it is a very good game, has a good economy, and sometimes I play for many hours because it is so fun. I hope others will enjoy as well."
"This is an AMAZING game! With the 9 very different classes and the millions of loadouts and new content like new maps and weapons it makes TF2 have endless amounts of fun! Not to mention, it's free!"
"People voting this game down doesn't have logic, basically if they play on valve server their problems are gone. (f2p scum, griefing, lag, etc...)  No one cares if you are f2p or not in a valve server.   "
"Best Game Ever, Nothing Else To Say!"
Nice game! 
" Team Fortress 2 is, at heart, a gloriously simple game that's been created with style, panache and an undeniable love of gaming. It's the kind of game that you want to show to people who don't play games so that they understand and then either get involved or go away. There is life before Team Fortress 2, and there is life after. After is better. "
Best way to waste your money on imaginary hats! 10/10
I like all of the action that is happening in this game. I would recomend this game because it is very fun and addicting 
"if you love a good laugh and a first person shooter, get tf2 it is now free on steam it is action packed whith 9 classes that will blow your mind !!!!!!"
This game is a very good game with funny moments and mass opertunities to have fun. If you are looking for a more serious game i reccomend playing a game like Counter Strike: Global Offensive
"This is the only FPS I own and, even if I get more, this will be my favourite and will always remain in the highest ranks of my favourite games of all time list. My one complaint is that it seems to be crashing more often than it should. I never had this problem until about a month ago, but it has gotten worse. I don't know if it's a problem with my computer, but it is annoying me now. Valve, please fix."
"Really funny game, with too many weapons, hats, and other..."
Shooting fun for everyone! Buy yours today! But wait! There's more! Get it now ABSOLUTELY FREE!
Great game. I spend lots of hours playing this game with my friends. And i must say: it´s one of the most funniest multiplayer games i´ve ever played. I recommend this game!
must play awesome game 
"TF2 is a hat-simulator-FPS what else do you need to describe? its awesome that one day your owning n00bs at one server and get shrekt at another.Well if you don't like pwning n00bs at one server there's a ALOT of modded servers that you can play on, like Idle Achivements,Slenderfortress,VS Saxton Hale hell even a Tf2 version of Prop Hunt and ALOT more.I only mentioned popular ones,Well if you don't want to kill humans with blood and organs going all over the place but you still want to kill, go to Mann vs Machine (MvM for short).There are no other team than red for you to join there all the players work together to defeat the robot army with a few upgrades which you can take from the upgrade station but you need  money.How?  kill robots get their money DONE.and the devs keep on upgrading the game the latest big update was more weapons and an introduction to beta maps(this was big cause it was rare for the devs to bring new weapons.).Now why are you still looking at other reviews download this game NOW! Trust me look how many hours ive played this (tip:does the enemy/teamate have better stuff or especially HATS than you? they mean NOTHING AT ALL NO SIDE EFFECTS AT ALL)"
Really Fun and Really Silly Game
Best game ever! :D I highly recommend it
Cause Virtual Dressup that cost in-game currency as you fight your way through exploding bodies is a normal match
This is game is AWESOME! You can get hats and some achievement hats and some weapons to help in fight and training to get used to the game.
it alsome
ENTIRE TEAM IS BABIES
Amazing game really recomended sorry about spellings but is really a good game
"Probably in the Top 10 for my favorite games of all time easily. So many modes, some fun mods... Well structured classes with their own deep backstories. Humorous. Not to mention that the balance and diversity of weapons is great. No overpowered weapons. Trading in this game adds a whole new dimension for some people. I don't trade for profit anymore. Why not give it a shot? It's free. If you take a liking to it I would highly reccommend going premium. I didn't go premium until I hit 200 hours though. It was definetly worth the 49 cent investment. DEFINETLY. I later went on to play competitive tf2, which I found increasingly fun compared to the pubs in which I was dominating the rest of the server. I think valve should add a match making/ rank system in tf2. It would really help the game garner more attention as an e-sport. I think the problem is that with out these built in features, few people know about competitive at all. PLZ VALVE PLZ  Now that valve has announced matchmaking for tf2, I like it even more. But I ask them humbly, please don't kill off direct x 8 support! The majority of the competitive community uses it and it would be appreciated if you would allow it in matchmaking. Or, alternatively you could optimize dx9 to give people better fps.  Thanks"
"Well... hmmm..... I like it.  There are too many good things about this game for just a review. Pick it up for yourself, seeing how its free nothing bad can happen~!"
"CANT, STOP, PLAYING, THIS, GAME! "
This game is amazing
One of the BEST and FUNNIEST games that I HAVE EVER PLAYED!
By far the most fun game I've ever played in my entire career of gaming. Other famous games don't even come close to the immense competition and free to play steam apps. Highly recommended.
This game is the best!
hat
"Tf2 is one of the best free-to-play games out there,there is so much things you can do like trading hats and would rate it 10/10 &lt;3"
"After wasting 1500+ hours of my life on it, I can tell that I have definately enjoyed every second. Meeting good people, trading, trolling with friends, getting banned from server for no reason and just having fun with friends in general.  The community is great. But a few things to remember: Dont cry on mic, people call you 5 yr olds Dont beg for free items, you might be reported Dont respond to people discouraging you from palying Dont scam new people to trading.  Dont call people scammers for asking more prices than 'backpack.tf' or paying less for your items And please dont be a spy/sniper when u alreasdy have 2 spies/snipers you will be the reason of your team loosing (Why did I waste 10 mins more of my life instead of just typping 'Great Game' ? I just dont know)"
It has hats... 10/10
This is bye far the most balanced and fare first person shooter I've ever played but does that really matter? No what matters is that its the most FUN first person shooter I've ever played! Long live TF2!
"This game is fun, Action packed and full of friend and real people to talk with and trade with, Youre charachter is virtually unlimited in terms of customization, Prices are expensive but the game is worth it, Play it now, It changes youre life!"
"Really fun, recommended to all users."
"Very fun game, once you start you won't leave it! There's a lot of variety, guns, hats and they aspects. Great to spend time with friends. Totally recomended."
"1 out of 10, not enough bread."
"Team Fortress 2 is an awesome, funny, cool and free game. I thought I'll play it about a month but I haven't stopped yet! I play for half an year and I've never disliked something!"
"This game is awesome, it has a very nice features and it allows me to stop working and comeback running back home to start playing this more than 16 hours :)"
previously my account got vac banned for cheating and now i made a new account. i have to rate vac a 9/10 for its amazing work.
Good game :) Try it out if u want to :D
"The Best FPS hat simulator to date and homicidal fun with friends at its finest.  If your tired of taking yourself seriously while murdering your friends and looking for something a bit different from the usual call of duty modern warfare simulator gameplay look no further.  Pros -------- One of the few FPS games that even a beginner to the genre can find something usefull to do; be it pushing the bomb cart, healing the team, setting up teleporters etc.  Valve Servers are and remain suprisingly non toxic community wise. Gameplay trolling is limited as its mostly part of normal legitimate gameplay design to be doing something insane in fact its practically mandatory.  Its free to play - all maps, modes and with all players and maintains a busy playerbase as a result.  There are no game breaking DLC's, in game items, levels or skill systems, no pay or grind to win options at all in fact... Only cosmetic items and sidegrade weapons; its all practice and skill.  Quake style physics and gameplay, Rocket/Grenade jumping, health packs, no ironsight headshots or KDR  Mann Vs Machine mode - team up with friends and take on waves of robots.  Cons ------- Its a mature game; probably now drawing towards the end of its development lifespan, so new significant content updates are few and far between its mainly community designed cosmetic items now.  The number of weapons and what they do can be a little bit overwhelming to the new player at the start as can the classes and what each one is capable of, although later this unpredictability becomes a core part of its replayability.  The mann vs machine (mann up) servers are generally not beginner friendly and the mode difficulties in general combined with the matchmaking system could have done with more thought to help smooth this out a bit."
It's free. Why not?
)))
Best place to carry out your sexual hat fantasies 10/10
best free game ever made it all ways will be thank you valve for making this 
Hat Fortress 2! Awsome game
its cool butt yah
I really recommend this game as it is f2p but it is a really good game :)
"An AMAZING fun game, a lot of fun and team based, The community is awesome and friendly and ive recomended this game to many of my friends :)"
I can wear hats. 10/10
Obviously the best Free-to-play game in Steam History.
Absolutely an amazing frist person shooter with great weapons and updates more fun than others and its free to play so etget i!
"Team Fortress 2 has changed the way I shop for games. Instead of those single player games that I will usually play, I look for games that thrive off of multiplayer. I look for games that rely on team work, like Counter Strike: Global Offensive and Left 4 Dead 2. This game has taught me team work. Team Fortress 2 is fun and the fun won't die out because Valve gives the game their unending support. They update it so it won't be stale, they update it so the community is involved, and they update it because Team Fortress 2 is Team Fortress 2. Plus don't you DARE forget about those mods and the custom servers!  This game doesn't even deserve a rating in my eyes. It's way too good for a rating.  I recommend this to anyone who can tolerate the cartoony graphics and for anyone who likes multiplayer games and working as a team.  Plus I just typed up whatever came to mind. I can probably type up something way better if I actually put my mind to it. But you know, there's the doctor assisted homicide!  HOORAH!"
Great game!
I'm writting this review for the badge
It's Free
this game IS AWSIME U AWDA DW
"Team Fortress has almost endless amount of enjoyment. The featured 9 classes differ just enough to keep the game surprising, but not overpowered for certain classes. Hats are awesome. Gaming depends purely on skill, expirience and reactions, so no one can buy handicaps. Game is FREE!  Note: The game must not be taken too seriously. If you keep getting killed by a same person, do not ruin the game of others. Just change the server or swap teams.   PS. Don't kill frendly heavies. Thats work against the law. You are also going to get killed that way. :)   Bladehero4 "
"I know there are a lot of good reviews for this game but hey make it another. I really do like no LIKE this game.It maybe hard at first but trust me i have been there too u get the hang of it.But anyway back to point,the main reason i recommend this game that is wacky and fun which suits me and everytime im down it always cheers me up.Also its action packed and intense(and rage inducing trust me). Once you get used to it can be a one FOKN hell of ride.And i hope you can join on this wild ride Enjoy!!!!!!"
"Its Free. Shut up, and Get it.   ...And Yeah its a good Game"
'probably one of the deepest and most spiritually humbling experiences of our generation'
I love this game its a great FPSs I recomend it to all out there who play FPSs games
This game Is The most played Game on my Libary (shared libary) I Love this game and im sure you will too! :D
ive spent over 2700 hours in this game and im still bad at it   10/10
Played this for 5years. Never had so much fun in my life. 5/5 would waste 5 years again.
Team Fortress 2 is AWESOME
"This games is the first FPS I ever played and it has something, mostly visible, that others don't have. TF2 shows that it doesn't need to be serious all the time by having silly taunts and hats and that you can have fun in a lot more ways than the game itself presents you. I'm talking about the awesome community that helps it out by creating content for the game ranging from hats and weapons to even gamemodes that have a load of potential and can be a lot of fun too."
it is such a great game that i always enjoy playing.
one of the best games i ever played including non free games definently get it whether u r new to games or experienced
your life can't be completed without this game
I very well recomend this game :D
This is a good game if you are like me and you like games that are good.
"An interesting and wonderful game, Best game for Free ever   My Rating : 10/10"
"Absolutely one of the best games I've ever played. There's so much diversity and randomness that playing never gets old. Every class has its role and when played correctly, they fit together perfectly. Even new players should have no trouble getting the hang of any given class, and because of weapon balance, no player has an unfair advantage over another. Sure, scouts will almost always win a 1v1 with a sniper at close range, but a sniper will almost always win a 1v1 with a heavy at a distance. No unlock is objectively better than what you start out with, but promote different playstyles.  A Dear Ringer spy doesn't have to be as careful as a Cloak and Dagger spy. Gunslinger engineer won't usually be in one spot for too long. Overall, 10/10. I wholeheartedly recommend this game. And if you have no idea what I was saying in this review, then play the game!   It's free."
Awesome game. Cartoonic game style. It'll take over your life.
there should be a way to give a wrap gift to at friend with out trading
It is THE most unrealistic war game known to man... witch makes it the best war game known to man. please get this game &lt;:-) thank you.
Best Point and Click Adventure game since COD:4 Modern Warfare
Best game I ever played it is a team oriented game and DEFAULFT IS THE BEST WEAPONS IN THE GAME OK every other weapon is a sidegrade I have foundnearly a hundred friends here if you need help tell me on my profile I will try my best but this game is also how you play so dont worry about it. And Dont listen to people who think you always need to get that headshot they are just idiots who think they are pro at the game killed hundreds ♥♥♥♥♥♥ them all off and had fun doing it and remember play every class that will help yo out with several of the classes other than that try your best and have fun talk to yall later.
thumbs up
"Tf2 is probably one of the best game I've ever played. The variety of classes, the way every single one is different from one another and the fast-paced action combined with the cartoonish look makes this game different from any other game out there. And HATS!!"
Awesome game that definitely should be played by everyone
"This game is amazing because you get to have a first person shooter experience,trade items,and get better equipment and also when you get some nice gear everyone will think your not f2p &lt;------- New People To Tf2 (Free To Play) but anyway if you buy something from the steam store you wont be f2p you will be p2p (Pay To Play) and you can get strange weaopns genuine festive unusual and all diffrent kinds of things but if your friend tells you to play this game you should."
One of the best games ever made... The best game ever made
This game is the most unique fps game i have ever played. 10/10 would use my moneh on useless dlcs that come out.
best game on p.ci have plus its a great game just to chill and relax while playing with a couple mates
I enjoy the team play and the ability to craft items to different weapons. I would recommend this game to any friend.
Good for f2ps and premium accounts. Has lots of taunts and a lot of fun to go along. It helps when you need something to play and are really bored.
the best
THIS IS AWESOME 
Hadoukened an enemy with my pyro.  11/10
Great game. Highly addictive!
i love this game so much but there a few bugs and glitches that need to be fixed
blew my ♥♥♥♥ing mind
Oh my god I love it 
I so dearly love this game! It's a huge community and even full commerce on items from the game of all sorts.  There are so many mods that really enhance the game. New updates that add some great features like beta maps that can be played on which features a new game mode name 'Robot Destruction' with a new way to score.  That and so much more!
This game has made me waste over 2k on hats. GG
"Even though it's really old, it's still very fun and everyone should play this game. If you don't like blood then there's something called 'Pyrovision goggles' that dont show blood or bullets, but instead it shows rainbows."
"I love the game, personally and I recommend it to new gamers to steam because its a simple game of capture points, capture the flag, attack/defend and...well violence"
Just a ripoff of overwatch Kappa
so its a really good game but i cant et it 2 open it says the scripts dont work 
"Hours of fun to be had, and plenty of skill to be learned! You can never be too good at this game."
the best fun you can have online and its free so shut up and play it
its a great game with a better folowing that most fps's today
best hat simulator i have played in my entire life. would r8 8/8 m8
"This simple game is addictive as hell. Even if you like realistics games, you will like it. Nine classes, every class has other skills, other weapons. Comic graphics, unrealistic combat system (when you play as a heavy 3 rockets shooted from a rocket launcher won't kill you), it makes that you'll be spending time with this game even better. You can buy premium, but it doesn't make this game 'pay to win'. Premium gives you a possibility of trading. You can trade hats (you'll love them), miscs, weapons ant other stuff. I recommend Team Fortress 2 for everyone who likes having fun playing games. This game ruined 2000 hours of my life :D."
"Love TF2 free to play and a blast, can't really go wrong with this one!"
The best game I ever had in my life
One of the best games I have ever played it has bots to practice on training and even.... HATS!  Hats is one of the most important things in tf2 also pootis thanks for listening &lt;3
"It is an excellent, fun and a wacky experience that I believe most people will love. Even though it is difficult in the beginning keep playing and everything will be easier."
Best damn game for free on steam BY FAR
Strap on your pyrovision goggles and gibuses its gonna be a bumpy ride
"Team Fortress 2 is well created. It captures the 'cartoon' like appearance, as well as stays with the first person shooter style. The one thing that really stands out in Team Fortress 2 is the variety of items. It goes from a shotgun (default engineer main weapon and soldier's secondary) to a highly advanced laser gun (Pomson 6000). Classes. Team Fortress 2 has them. The classes have variety too. All of the nine classes are unique in many ways. The spy can backstab, cloak, and disguise. The engineer can build and upgrade buildings which include: sentry guns, dispensers, and teleporters! Another thing that stands out to me, is the storyline. How could a first person shooter have an amazing storyline? I have no idea. But the hard workers at Valve saw an oppurtunity to make a good storyline when the game progressed, or at least that is what I understand. I wont spoil the storyine, but wow it is amazing. That's really all I have to say about this fantastically created game.    Whiplash  "
"It's a really great game for people who like FPS, I enjoyed this game alot but sadly, there were quite alot bugs in this game. Thats right Gaben, 9 years of development, HOPEFULLY it'll worth the weight. :D But seriously, this game is epic! 9.99 / 10 for me"
One of the best fps and mmo
"Personally my favorite video game of all time. Full of hilarious kills, one liners, overpowered weapons, and of course hats. Also great with friends"
Its an extremely enjoyable game whether your playing it for the enjoyment or the items! Its amazing that its free!
"Great game, includes hats, 9 cent premium, more hats, gibus snipers.   Remember, shooters are not for everyone, this game can cause: Vomiting, compulsive vomiting, diahrrea, explosive diahrrea, implosive diahrrea, death, super-death, convulsions, epilepsia, undeath,etc.  Speak to your local gun toating madman for further info."
i acually got this game because my friends keeps telling me to try it out Qwerty also told me so when i tried i cant belieave that it was so addictive 
very good must play
Best PC Shooting Game EVER!!
"I spent so much money on this game. My friends ask me why I have such little money, and I just say one word: HATS"
th best
"'Awesome game would definately reccomend' says me in January 2013.  This game is a solid mix of intense gameplay, pure unadulterated fun, and is overall a great shooter.  The dynamic gameplay and variety amongst classes leads to a different experience every time, single plays expertly pulled off change the flow of the match to where a game is never decided by a team just being better.  The community is alive and thriving, the varying skill levels meaning you're never at the bottom of the barrel, and nigh-on every game you can come away saying 'That kill was amazing!'.  It's free! You may as well give it a chance, and if you don't like it then that's fine! No £40 wasted, no Steam refunds ticking over, you just know that you didn't enjoy it. I must say that this is an awesome game, would definately reccomend."
"This game is Fun!, soldier is my character, and his Cool!"
10/10
"Team Fortress 2 to me is the epitome of FPS's, sure you get some gems, such as Bioshock or Borderlands, but TF2 will always be there to surprise you. My most heartfelt recommendation."
Amazing all kinds of fun and they are always adding something new. Come check it out.
Slightly improved my hand-eye coordination while greatly developing my economic intuition.
A hell of a time waits for you when you play Team Fortress 2!
I love this game its super fun!
This game is g8 m9 give 8/8 all you cheeky scrubs
A very solid first person shooter with different ways to play every time
"Great game! Fun and free, AND the economy is amazing!"
"This game can even be your only reason to have a Steam account and has over 500 achievements that you could earn. It also never gets boring, because of the active community and the updates of the developers! You want a cool hat? Buy it! You want a cool weapon? Buy it! Support TF2? Buy it! Wouldn't rate any game higher than this."
amazing never had more fun one of the best games ive ever played!
Team Fortress 2 caters for all types of gameplay. Solid game through and through.
"Amazing game to play with friends online! Also a great first game to have. With its bouncy, cartoony style its a great game to enjoy and have fun with."
I just.. I can't stop playing..  A mixture between the gameplay and the people are what sets this game differently from the rest.   Find some nice people on a nice server and spend 2k+ hours of your time there.
"Has Changed My Life In Many Ways From Getting Myself In Trouble For Playing Untill 4 AM To Making New Friends, This Game Is At It's Finest When There Are No Kids Around And Everyone Has Cosmetics :D 10/10 Would Play Again"
"Really fun game, but be warned it is addictive!"
10/10 i love this game it is so intertaning especily when you find those custo servers the only annoying thing about it is finding the class that fits you also if you get it go onto assyrians custom server for saxton hale it is alot of fun and the peopl are really ar intertaning now get going and have some fun
Best free to play shooter 11/10 Great work!
"TF2 , A great multiplayer game , it's my childhood game , if you haven't played it yet , try it and you may like it , you've got a lot of random weapons , 9 classes and a realy fuzzy gameplay ! I recomand you to play it because it's fun , but more with friends so try it too and then you choose !"
A great game i love the art style and gameplay a great game for people who like cartoon styled First Person Shooter's.
-gaben can we have new weapons pls? PLS?  -yeah  *skins added* outsmarted
This Game is The Best.
this is a really fun game with differnet weapons and items and physics and the overall quality of the game is fantastic. it the type of gameplay for people tha play something like CoD but at a little faster pace. i recommend getting this game and trying it out
Certainly one of the best first person shooters of all time.
cool game 
"The Scout: all people from Boston or Massachusetts in general are loudmouthed and whiny little arrogant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s The Soldier: all people from the American military are dumbasses with a superiority complex The Pyro: who knows The Demoman: all scots are drunk off their asses 24/7 on cheap whiskey and use explosive weapons because why not The Heavy: all russians are slow and fat and somewhat dense human tanks with over-attachment to their large weapons The Engineer: apparently all people from texas are smart but I doubt that somehow The Medic: all germans are mad scientists with heads and hearts in their fridges who use fire hoses to make things invincible etc The Sniper: all australians are lunatics who throw urine at their enemies and use large knives, and also just happen to have guns with extreme range The Spy: all french people are cowards who hide in the dark and kill people with lies and subterfuge  It is literally a game where you play the personification of a stereotype and proceed to kill other personifications of stereotypes in a land where your skill is measured by your commitment to buying your virtual stereotypes burning/electrified/fly-infested headwear, because two old people got mad over who owns a bunch of gravel  there is bread  there are bombs on railroad carts  there are maps where you deliver a monkey that is contained in a suitcase probably full of really horrible undergarments  there are titanium-strength lollipops, swords/shields, lasers that make it more difficult for you to use a fire hose to make things invincible, jars of non-milk substances, you get the point  there are frying pans  made of not even gold, although maybe, I don't actually know  that people have paid five and a half freaking GRAND for  this is, by far, the most perfect game that is or ever will be  11/10 would spend every shekel"
"My first steam game with almost 500 hours , i feel i have invested many enjoyable hours with friends, strangers and BOTS. In a way, these people help you get better as you help them. i have enjoyed over 9 classes and i havnt looked back"
"This game should be the first game you should ever play....its free and its awesome.I will declare this game the king of all games.For all of those new gamers,this is it for you.By far addictive,awesome,and a customizable place lies the so forth Team Fortress 2."
"The game is really fun! All the classes take time to get used to, but after you get used to them, its really, really fun! Perfect for friends to have 1v1 matches or have 20v20 matches with everybody. Only bad thing is that it does however take a few minutes to start, but thats for almost every game out there now. Overall, it is amazing."
"Its TF2.  Really, its kinda imposible not to know what this game is.  You know, the game Valve made and then realized 'Hay, we dont need to make games anymore, we can just let people make stuff for us and we can just sit and make money off em! This is as easy as 1 2.... um, nothing after 2.'"
free game and very fun. although warning- this game wants your money so be careful.
I love this game. trading is awesome and cooll!!!! 
"Team fortress 2 (TF2) Is My Favourite Game of all time, this is because how funny this game is and how much competitive effects it. I highly reccomend everyone to play this game. :D"
5/7
Fast paced and fun with a steepish learning curve. Totally recommend if you enjoy goofy games and/or shooters.
Best Game in the whole fricking world!! Like gmod
the best multiplayer fun! and its free to play!
this is a amazing game
"The most craziest game and fun friendly game, When friendlies are about tryhards come about ~or dics instead~"
"love the game, 5 stars!!!"
"Good game, addicting af"
This is a really awesome game
cool game
its so cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!         
"This game is just epic , the best F2P game I ever played ."
i reccomend a moderate-beefy pc for this 
I want my life back
This has to be one of the best games on computer i would definately recommend if your coming from consoles for the first time  
"Play this game, this are a awesome game inztall this game :) "
"The new feature adding the ability to pick up weapons has ruined the game, by adding several glitches. Removing this feature or narrowing it down to a specific gamemode would improve the game loads.."
Very fun and interesting game that can be played for hours on end.  The perfect free to play to get started with first person shooters.
Awesome game. Recommend it to people who play really aggressive in games or want to start a friendship with other people. The game also has many irresistible skins and new cosmetics every 2 or 3 months.
"First time i played i dint know NOTHING but my fried gave me some tutorials and i turned into a master and m favorite mode is mvm because you can have extremly good upgrades like more magazine size,but i will like it even more if it have mvm survival that you need to survive until the time ends "
"This is an amazing game! I always love playing it and get great joy from doing well in it... The games never get old and newer updates are never too far away, so there are new items all the time. "
Idk what to say. Just wanted to write a review for ruffis.
"This game has better team work encouragement than ANY other game I've seen to date, great job valve! anybody scouting this game should definitely buy, its free! "
Play this game. Now.
"This is the greatest game ever! The updates, everything is balanced perfectly its just perfect 11/10"
This game is for everyone. Play and enjoy.
"Great game, it stays true to the classic while improving a lot of things."
i have over 1000 hours in this game and if i were to say myslef i absolutley love this game i think its one of the best free to play games ive ever played heck its even better then some of the games i bought with real money so i recomend this to anyone who loves fps.
What can i say? Its TF2. It speaks for itself at this point.
this game i awesome if u like action or comedy then this is the game for you mate!
this game is 7 years old and still better than 80% of all shooters out there 10/10
"I honestly didn't play the game long enough to ask people for help.   This is one of the best free to play fps I have ever played. The graphics and the classes have been well made and the gameplay is great. Stock weapons are great but better to get modified versions for example strange weapons that count total kills, killstreaks, specialized, proffesional etc. There are also some designs for weapons like Australium which are rare and can be earned in Mann vs Machine and festive weapons which are also cool and I forgot to mention about golden weapons like the golden frying pan and the golden wrench which turn enemies into gold on kill.  The workshop weapons and the unlockables provided are great too but some of them of course are pure garbage but are modifiable to be strange weapons or killstreaks etc.    But it's not just about the weapons, it's also about the cosmetic items and taunts. There are clothes for each class so that they look badass and hats or hairstyles. There are taunts provided for the weapons you use and there are awesome taunts which you either buy or trade like conga!  When I was an f2p it sucked for me especially when I was a gibus. I am thankful right now though because I bought the giftapult a few months before it became an item that could be crafted in the Christmas update.    I personally don't take the game too serious like some others that were well experienced and some that aren't even experienced enough to experienced players noobs and then goes a scandal between the 2 people in the chat or microphone and others are hoping for someone to stop them or they would call a vote to kick them.   But apart from that I think this is a great game and for those that are reading it and are thinking of playing this game go install it now!  Rating: 10/10"
It's a really fun game. especially when you find a good team to play with.
"Meh, it's decent but it get borings after 3 hours."
After past 900 hours on it I can only tell it's a nice game
Why dont you have this?
One of the best multiplayer games that's feauteres many classes you can choose from A huge workshop that's feauteres many amazing items you will enjoy this game so much with your friends
"If you have steam, what are you doing not playing this game?"
"When I'm depressed, I look at my soldier with the executioner, marxman, and Viking braider. I fall out of my chair laughing. When I fell, I hit my head on a toy train and had to go to the ER. Thanks tf2"
"TF2 is slowly dying on it's own. Valve is just trying to get the last bit of the juice drops from the box before it's empty. The game itself is really good and if you haven't ever played it, you should try it since it doesn't look like there's much time for it. My personal experience with this game is great. I made so many friends thanks to it and got so much fun from it in my darker days. Always when coming back from school I just got on the computer and played it, ignoring all of my responsibilities. I loved it. The game was great and had a lovely community always willing to help. Both the game and the community changed. The updates Valve kept making just made people more upset, not thankful for giving their beloved game attention, and that's for a reason - each and every update was worse and worse. Some people still have faith in Valve, some, like me, just lost it and quit the game. It's just so painful to realize that your favorite game is dying really slowly. It's like cancer. All of the positive memories gone because the developers just don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the game they made anymore. They're just trying to get money off of it for as long as they can. To summarize it all it's pretty much a great game you should try, it's free after all, but the game is losing it's fans and for good reason. I'm going to leave a negative reccomendation because of it's current state. Cheers."
I've spent too much time trading my head hurts
*sigh* Why dont you have this game yet?  Team fortress 2 in my opinion anyways is one of the best FPS games in the world FOR FREE!
This game is freaking awesome Texture is normal its for free items drop pay low This game is Such Awesome i cant say more than this
would r8 m8 8 outta 8
"The core gameplay is addicting as hell, the hats are extremely diverse, and it's one of the most well thought-out games I've seen. My hours of playing is equal to 50 days, which makes up about 11% of what I've done since I began playing, and that's a lot. It's too good to stop playing."
IT IS AMAZING!!!
10/10 Would play until I die
its a great game i liek it u should try it xdddddddd
Let me tell u...this is the best game ever...y? cuz it keeps 1.getting new..it will never bore u..it keeps adding new stuff. 2.great characters. 3.gameplay is very nicely balanced. 4.extremely fun.  Cant believe a game so amazing is free to play
"I really like this game. There are a lot of cosmetics and classes to choose from, and I like the graphics. There's a lot of maps, and gamemodes. It's really fun."
"an overall brillant game with good gameplay classes and modes to choose from but some of the weapons are just either too overpowered or just too weak,but most are very balanced.Another complaint is that when i try to trade it says i must get steam guard from the settings but i lack the knowlegde of where it is in the settings,i do not dislike this too much though because i dont realy need to trade much.I also suggest a new class as it slowly gets boring if you use the classes too much.But my complaints dont realy bother me much and i still find myself coming over to my laptop to play it.You did good valve, you did good.Anyone who hasent played this,go search it up and start the download."
" Suprisingly, this is my opinion. Don't get your jimmies in a twist. If you're viewing this on my profile, please click leave a comment so you can see the formatting    Abstract"
10/10 IGN   'like skyrim but with mini-crits'
"Addictive, competitive but full of hats"
Best Free-2-Play game ever made.
This game is One Of The Best Games Ive Ever Played I Highly Recemend It
"This game WAS the greatest multiplayer FPS ever. But now Valve has turned it into their money printing machine, squeezing an insane amount of bucks out of people for useless or game disturbing items. DO NOT buy this game, you will end up spending nights on tradeservers and writing recommendations to get virtual items :oP."
Terrible. Wouldn't reccomend it for anyone. Met some really autistic people here.
"Graet game, cant play it enough!"
Nice game
I love this game
Overall a great and balanced FPS. 10/10 would eat sandvich again
"1000/10 - Made from a free item drop to a 100$ inventry , amazing gameplay!!!"
This is the best game ever!
just a game that all love
Love playing this game with friends ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
Best FPS free to play on this planet if you haven't tried this game I strongly recommend you do 100/100
"This game is great for me. it's not only a typical shooter (doesn't matter it's class playing type). It's game that lets you meet with other people. In TF2 you don't have to kill or complete goals. You can just be friendly, dance with others or have a taunt party (wich is the best part of game to me). You can collect items and combine them in many different ways. Cosmetic items let you be original and have your own style. Some items aren't even made to kill, but only to have fun. There are so many glitches, deploits and easter eggs in tf2 that you may never find them all. That's what you can do during normal match too, same as I do sometimes. Anyways, there's a plenty of ways to play TF2 that everybody can play."
It's a great game and I want to all people to try it.
"What can be said about Team Fortress 2 which hasn't been said?   This game is game is fun. A lot of fun. Whether you want push a bomb to an enemy base, steal a briefcase, or capture some control points, this game is accessable and fun to anyone.  This game is NOT like other shooters. There is no minimap, no helicopters, and no killstreaks. This game has hats.  And it's free - that's the best part, absolutely free."
"this is pretty good. no, it won't die"
Best conga simulator i have ever played. 10/10 would conga again.
One of my favourite games of all time 
This is great game!
I recommend this game its fun i always play it i understand that everyone says that the 'Meet your match' update ruined the game but i still play it and enjoy it.
Team building fun game.
This game is amazing and it's fun to play with it
"Although I do not care for fps styled games, TF2 is awesome and a recommended download."
this is a very good game and i would recommend this to anybody who likes cartoon like shoo  ters
I like this game. It is a good game. It is a fantastic game. It is an amazing game. It is a cool game. It is a Valve game. It is a shooting game. It is a diverse game. It is a balanced game. It is not a F2P game. It is a hat simulator. I like this game.
Good Free-to-Play game.
"This game is something you cannot get bored over. The humor, the style, the uniqueness is something that will last a lifetime, forever even! And there are plenty of whacky game mechanics that ensure you come back for more!"
"When you can't decide what to play, you play TF2."
best game ever if you like shoot em up games and a pro with mouse control
Best taunt and hat simulator of 2016 by far.
Review  This is an excellent FPS. It has alot of charm. Excellent balance. And looks amazing. And one of the best features is Free to play. You do not need to pay to play. You can get weapons without money. Or you can buy them. And the community. OMG I could not even describe it. You just have to play for your slef. I would give it an 10 out of 10
this game is just auseome no matter what for me
"This game is great. But it has problems, the people who work on this game obviously havent ever played the game (Buffing stuff that doesnt need buffing and nerfing stuff that oesnt need nerfing) And they dont interact with the community. Everyone knows the Meet your match update was absolute garbage, I feel that there is no real motivation to make matchmaking fun to play and rewarding I think they should give you IDK a trophy or maybe a badge that you can level up like the dueling badge. Casual is good though better than people say its waiting times arent as bad now but they will take a second and the problem with waiting a long time to get into a game that will only last a minute or two is just sad I dont think casual should have a leveling system, because that means everyone is going to tryhard and not have fun like people did in when pubs were a thing. Valve you have community updates that you can use and we have the pyro update to look forward to just please do the right thing and make this game great again."
Good game lots of random stuff and overall fun
"TF2 is what i do almost every day even though there are a few bugs, I recommend it for you guys!"
Tf2 is better then COD
So far one of the most fun game that i have ever played
The game is too good. Had loads of fun but the new update and the searching time for a casual match makes it really annoying.
The Reason why i love TF2 is because it has a lively community with great workshop items a good economy and dedicated fans who want to make guides to new players that's why i reccomend TF2 although it has its problems I still strongly reccomend it so i suggest you check it out if your new.
Amazing!!!! much better then console version!
I love this game
This game is good in so many ways ill just shut up and click the yes button.
Nice Game I Love this Game :D &lt;3
remember to stay sun safe
"Played it for a while, it's okay I guess."
"The team-based shooter to which all others aspire. This game provided me many years of both joy and profound frustration. Bought it before it was free, and have no regrets having paid for it. An absolute delight."
Pretty awesome!
eum its pretty fun but sometimes youg et sick and tired playing TF2
Amazing! 10/10 Recommend to everyone!
"Its a great Game. Better then cod, Its a hat simulator game, And the best game ive evered played.."

"FPS Shooter games have been spread out around the world becoming popular, but when it comes to TF2 it's like no other. It's simply made and easy to play just like the way it's made, it's different every day with new thing's to do with new updates, including taunts, cosmetics, and loads more, building up the game. What makes TF2 a unique game apart from COD and BF is that it's not as big as those games, well ofcourse it has loads of stuff, but not as sophisticated as the other FPS shooters. It does not have singleplayer, not that (extreme) graphics and including other more features that other games have and not TF2. But not having features like COD or BF makes it better and unique not worse and more repetitive, therefore when COD or BF players try TF2 for the first time they don't really understand the concept of the game, which explains the game is unique. Overall TF2 is an addictive and unique Game with lots to discover, hoping the game get's better. 10/10"
hat simulator 2016 i love the part where you conga and ignore the objective. but srs tho nice game just nerf the phlog m80s

"You know, while I wasn't a part of the community for this game for the most part, the fact that Valve allowed TF2 to become what it has is disappointing, not just for me, but for the diehard fans as well. TF2 has had a strong run up to this point, but valve has really messed this game up with it's most recent update. The competitive system they implemented is highly flawed, even more so than Overwatch, the closest competitor that TF2 has in terms of gameplay. Something I liked about TF2 was its quick play system, which allowed for some great casual FPS. With the new system it's purely matchmaking, even in casual mode, which makes the game feel much more serious then it should. I have friends who lived, breathed, and bleed TF2, who were so excited for this update, only to be disappointed by its poor implementation. It's pretty much to the point where they've basically gave up on TF2 and migrated to Overwatch, which also feeling serious at times as well, but is much more polished and allows for us to have an enjoyable gameplay experience. Eventually Valve may fix TF2, but considering they're more focused On VR right now, face stiff competition from Overwatch, and make more money from CS:GO and Dota 2 anyways, I doubt that'll be the case."
its good

"2/10 After many, many updates the game is unplayable."
The game is incredibly awesome one of the best hat based shooters out there haaaaats 
Very nice game. The new updates kinda screwed it up but im still having fun on community servers.
10/10 best Valve game I've played
"Well. I've played this game quite a bit. Not nearly as much as many others have but it is my most played game by far. I hopped aboard when it went f2p and slowly but steadily fell in love with it. A class-based shooter that encourages teamwork and includes many quirks and fun things you just don't see elsewhere.  I decided to finally write a review of TF2 since many things have changed recently. With the release of Overwatch, we've seen a decline in player numbers with some people even completely jumping ship and cutting all ties with TF2. I mean... I plan to get Overwatch myself but overreacting like that is just nonsense. So Valve decided to do something drastic and add a competitive mode as well as removing pubs completely, replacing them with casual matchmaking. The shock was real for me. I had taken a hiatus from the game and came back to a different world.  Now, there are some issues in both competitive and casual matchmaking. It seems Valve really just rushed them in. Full panic mode. The wait times were very long first, but that seems to be mostly solved. But gone are the times when you just hopped into a Valve server, played a few maps with the same people, making new friends and having a good, relaxed time. I really do hope that we get an option to extend casual matches to avoid constant queuing. Other than that, I have no major complaints about casual.   I've also tried competitive a bit and the ranking system is a complete trainwreck. No placement matches so a total noob can be matched with a veteran of 5000 hours in their first competitive games. That doesn't make any bloody sense. Also, matches are rendered null and void if anyone leaves. This is incredibly frustrating. I have so far only recorded losses because I've been unlucky enough to have someone on the opposing team quit when my team is winning. This is a serious problem for me. It takes out a lot of fun and satisfaction to see my efforts turned into dust just because someone decided to ragequit. Either make the punishments much more severe or give the winners the rank improvements and statistics of a match won, even if someone leaves. Just don't punish the losing team if someone there decides to drop out.  Basically, TF2 is still a great game despite some balancing issues and the problems of matchmaking systems. Don't give up on this grand old lady. Valve seems to be listening to TF2 players more, with all the complaints coming in and players leaving. They just have to get their ♥♥♥♥ together and fix the problems that are giving players headaches right now."
It's still a great game. Don't fear change.
Awesome game love it!!!!! 
"This game is awesome, it's a first person shooter with multiple classes to play and master, playing this game will reward you with cool class items and hundreds of achievements. This game is my favourite game for two reasons.   1. Hours of fun  2. ITS FREE  Download and Enjoy"
  Amazing game for those shooter fans strategy included in download
"First steam game. Funny, tactical , social and topped off with slightly cartoonic highly graphic exploding spleens and internal'toys' A must play for everyone, yeah it's free go on try it. Plus No scoping is way easier"
I have put a lot of time into this game and I love it. I am a big tf2 fan and will love this game forever even when it is in rough times. If you love customization of play style this game has much of it as well as game does like death run on community servers. Overall i highly reccomendation this. 
"fun first person shooter that isnt all run around shoot this grab that. Instead it has teamwork (sometimes) and game changing items (banners, crits, JAARATEH!) that i havent seen in any other first person shooter. All thats bad is... uhh.... NAHZING!!! is perfekt awesome contents downlod nao pls"
Its alright I guess
"It may be an old game, but don't let that fool you; it's continualy updated with new stuff!  Plus it is free, why not give it a try?"
♥♥♥♥ this game it ruined my life
if you're bored
"So... TF2 has been killed with the Meet Your Match update, and seeing/hearing everything that is up with it, I'd say its time for my opinion.  From what I noticed, Quickplay is gone, completely, bye bye. This had been a big part ever since TF2, removing it changed TF2 greatly, and replacing it with Casual Mode isn't helping one bit.  Competitive, now, people was hoping for this to be added to TF2 like it was in CS:GO. But from the things I seen, its becoming more toxic than what Quickplay was (Opinion taken from Youtube video, I never play competitive). And seeing hackers like LAMO box users are entering it and the vote kick feature removed from that mode and leaving mid-game will give you a short temp ban from it, its not helping it much.  Casual. Now I know what you are thinking, 'But you already talked about Casual.' No, that was me talking about Quickplay being removed. For Casual, its similar to Competitive, without that much hackers, able to leave mid-game without the temp ban, and able to vote kick people. And being able to not pick whatever map you wanna play on (Which was a big part of Quickplay) is bugging a lot of people out. People had been noticing this long queue time with this mode, and Valve already said it was, to quote, 'a bug, not a feature' which was last month ago. I have no clue if this was fixed or not, cause I hadn't played TF2 since last month, when the update released.  All in all, my final opinion is that TF2 has its kinks here and there thats need a fixing, but IT IS NOT DEAD. Valve just failed to take notice on this and causing people to quit and giving it a bad review. I am not quitting TF2 unless Valve somehow manages to pull off 3 horrid updates in a row. This update is strike 1 for me.  Just give the game a chance, and if Valve doesn't fix this, then just quit."
OMG VALVE YOU DID IT AGAIN YOU DESTROYED TEAM FORTRES 2 WITH MEET YOUR MATCH UPDATE
"If you like headwear, guns, and magic, this is the game for you. Its not all about hats, its about killing the other team. (And merazmus) You can collect weapons and level them up, giving them ranks. Headwear is a rare drop, but it can also be crafted. over all I'd rate this game 11/10 "
"I am Heavy weapons guy, and this, is my pawn shop. I work here with my old spy, and my partner, Medic. Everything here has a bullet, and a weapon. And after 9 years in development, you never know WHAT new weapon will come next. "
Best Free To Play Game Ever!!! Honestly some of the best steam game
"A massive thrilling game that is perfect for any LAN parties, would tap 11/10."
Great game
This game is amazing and i cant believe that it is still so good having it come out 7 years ago.
"Awesome game! Lots of hats and weapons, this game is perfect for any person who likes first-person shooters, strategy, collecting items and simply towering lots of plain fun!"
"Awesome class based chaos, perhaps the fairest and best free to play shooter out there and a refreshing change from call of duty , battlefield and other realistic fps games"
Funny game and alot of action
Good game has been out for some time but is very fun when you could get in to it. I have friends that play this game a lot I mean a lot. Game has good classes and plenty of items and game modes. but I would get this 100% if your new to steam since it's a real good game! You might not be able to get in to it but that's cool many other games out there.
"This game is so good I don't even need to write a review persuading you to get it... WAIT, THEN WHAT AM I DOING RIGHT NOW? REVIEWCEPTION? OH F*CK IT, I CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO CONTINUE THIS REVIEW. JUST GET THIS GAME."

Ben is getting me to download this BECAUSE ITS ALL HE WILL PLAY! JESUS CHRIST YOU ♥♥♥ ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?!
amazing game i recommend this game
swag game ze soldier is a pinges in side of a ♥♥♥♥ of a merazmus
This is fun ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Awesome game for new players.
All I haft to say is that the game is a well balanced shooter
10/10 would hat again
  Great game for people ho just got steam!
Great Game! 8/10
"Hat, wallet vacum and pootis simulator 10/10 i recommend this too everyone (it has wallet vacum and pootis simulator on one pack ;) )"
"First off, I am going to say that this is one of the best games I have ever played. But there are some problems with it, a while ago valve stopped giving tf2 major updates, and if we want tf2 to keep living and thriving we will need to do something about it. Second off, is pubs and comp. The skill leap from pubs to a comp level is insane and I do not reccomend trying to do lobbies until you have 100 hours in your main class. Other than that it is a great game and I hope you enjoy playing. ;)"
"This game is really fun to play with friends and just others people. It is constantly being updated and the comunity makes maps weapons and more. However it is prone to people being trolls, mean and just spamers. But get past that and it is a decient game other than the complete money grab *cough cough* mann co. store *cough cough*. I would sugest this to be a game that you put a little money into. This is my recomendation and others might tell you otherwise but it is a really good game with the odd nice player. So play it with whoever you want and keep on it untill you are the best or just sick of it. Than just keep playin."
"Good game, especially for free. Multiple classes to choose from, and this game doesn't get boring easily. Even if you're already almost the best you can get, it's still fun to unlock achievements, and much more!"
"WOW. This game impressed as soon as I 'hit play'. It has timeless cartoon-ish graphics that fall right in the boundary line between too animated and too realistic. It has a wide variety of characters, and a lot of items to find, so there will always be a reason to keep playing! Most of the characters are easy to play, but hard to master, so it wont be too difficult to switch characters and play as that one. I reccomend this game to anyone 10 and up. You can turn of the blood, and as long as a kid understands that it's not ok to do any of this in real life, and to keep a positive attitude, he/she should be find. See you in Pyroland!"
Digital Crack that runs on your grandma's 2005 dell pc
This game is the best game ever
LOVE IT
"People say the game is dying... I'm willing to say 'It isn't.' I believe in Valve, I believe they can just go through this low point. Others think this low in TF2 is the game dying... I think it's a phase, or better yet... 'The Test of Time'. If Valve tried, they can guide TF2 out of this troublesome phase. If we can make it out, the community might see some gains in terms of active members. I'm willing to play and pay for this game. This game is one of the only games I have ever paid for anything in.... This game is too hard to put down in my case. I want TF2 to live on until it's sequel comes out, what ever name it may be.  Until the phase ends, I wait across mirroring ponds... Silently Biding My Time. - TheGenericGamer"
it is good game
it has hats. best game ever.
By far the best first person shooter I ever laid my hands on.
"  I really love the game. I don't have a lot of hours on it compared to some people, but it is still very enjoyable. The hats, weapons, and overall diversity make this game great. Although if you are I don't recommend it if you have played CoD because tf2 is not as realistic if you like that type of thing."
Tf2 is a very cool game where you have many different possibilities to give your own character the weapons and items you want. The multiplayer in this game is fantastic and auto balanced.  9/10
"Best game ever. It can be silly and fun if you want it to, or it can be a try hard war game with cartoon graphics, highly recommend."
"The community is great, except some squeakers. Some weapon nerfs and buffs are annoying but overall the game is fun to play with friends."
"Even though many teamfortress's games were made, I think this was the best made version of Teamfortress because I love the 3d cartoon look, and it has more of a bright color feeling to the game then just a dark glooming war between two teams."
"There's nothing to say, the game says for itself .. still updated, its from Valve and its really fun beside I didn't like when they changed the game to free version. Worth it!"
"TF2 is a great game. It's vast amount of weapons and classes, combined with different tactics allow everyone to have a lot of fun in this game. Sadly, the recent updates had not given us any new weapons to play around with, hence, game burnout is setting in for me. Still, I recommend people to play tf2. =D"
"unusuals are for people who didn't get enough love from their parents and now seek attention  but yeah pyros and spies aside, good game"
"Overall, 9/10.  TL:DR Enjoyable game, fun economy and generally nice players.  Let's get started; The playerbase mainly consists of younger Gamers, but also includes a variety of people. You have the pure Trader with all their play-time on trade-servers, the F2P that has no idea how to trade and mainly plays for fun, the mixed player, who trades and plays for fun and the annoying trolls that attempt to ♥♥♥♥ up every single second of your gameplay.   The Squeakers; Yes, this is an issue. A squeaker is a younger player of the gaming community, that has a higher-pitched or an annoying voice that many players find highly irritating. Squeakers are not only found in TF2, but in the majority of online-gaming. There is an in-built mute system in Team Fortress 2 that some-what eliminates the Squeakers.   The 'Rich Kids'; Usually the 'Rich Kids' are found on Spycrabbing servers, Unusual Trade-Servers and gambling servers in general, they thrive by showing off their riches that they won purely from luck or purchased with real-world currency. Do not communicate with these players, they will toss you aside like trash on a side-walk.   The Pure Traders; These players love to trade. They spend all of their play-time on trading servers and websites. They don't care about the TF2 gameplay, they purely care about how much their Backpack is worth and how fast they can trade up to an unusual from a scrap.. These players are nicer than the 'Rich Kids' but still annoying. They hate F2P Members with a passion and take up any opportunity to ♥♥♥♥-talk them.   The F2P Players; They are the most innocent of the playerbase, they are usually new players that have just downloaded the game and want to hop into a match, only to get ♥♥♥♥-talked by every paid player they talk to. They take time to become a paid player, not realizing you have to spend real money to upgrade, or pain-stakenly trade up to a Premium Upgrade. If you see a F2P player, give them a weapon. It'll mean the world to them.  The Trolls; The amount of trolls on Team Fortress 2 is immense, they are everywhere, no-matter where you go. They enjoy ♥♥♥♥ing with F2P Players and Premium Players alike. They are annoying, under 11 and they usually have a foul-mouth. I am not going to go in detail on what trolls do to troll you, but feel free to search around on YouTube.  ~This Review is W.I.P~"
"Team Fortress 2 is without a doubt one of the greatest games I have ever played. Fantastic class balance, enjoyable gameplay, and a wide variety of strategies. 10/10 would most definitely reccomend"
The words I have for this game are not enough to describe how good this game is.
I like this game because of the quality and fun when playing it.
"Team Fortress 2, where do I even start... THIS GAME IS FREAKING AWESOME! I have played Team Fortress 2 for 2 years now (love the irony), and I have just yet to stop loving this game. It is constantly updated with new gamemodes, weapons, maps, and of course HATS! This game has got to be one of the finest free to play First Person Shooters out there, and heck it might be one of the best first person shooters out there period. It has nine different classes to choose from all with unique weapons, abilities, and playstyles (my personal favorite is the soldier). It is wonderfully balanced and takes a lot of skill to master many of the classes. It has random drops so if you don't want to pay to get new things you can just have items drop (I suggest spending money on something say for example a hat because it then allows you to trade).  Overall, Team Fortress 2 is probally my favorite game of all time so far and gets my first 10 out of 10 on any of my reviews."
a simply good game.
"Very good game.  Before I started playing this game, I though it was horrible. Cartoony, simple and easy and just plain boring. But with all the talking about how good this game is, I realize I was wrong all along, as the 'cartoons' are the fun of it. And it being easy, I wouldn't say so :P  Also it's got prices on the items you get so you can sell them for metal which then you can buy other things, to become richer and richer! I really love that mechanic. Would really recommend this game!  11/10 IGN"
"yummy, best game. bye"
"Great game, love it, no bugs. :)"
"Considering the fact that I've played this game since 2009, I have seen things come and go. I name TF2 a wonderful casual FPS that has many quirks and fun things to do."
"This is my favourite game for the past few yrs, I have met many different fds from different countries. Buz of trading stuffs(?) btw It's a very interesting game, the characters are very lovely, I love pyro! xD I'll play this game everyday if I hv time. You should really try to play this game too!"
Hat simulator. Needs More hats
ITS A GREAT GAME!!
I like the way they created this game
i really like this game. 100% just a few problems that arent that big If you want a f2p game that is easy to play but hard to master here it is
"Great Game, ! Strongly recommend to steam users"
"Very fun first person shooter. I reccomend this to anyone who likes a fun, funny, and somewhat violent games."
"-download tf2 -start it -join a valve server -get free hats by palying -equip them -join another valve server -see everyone else is wearing the same hats as you -no problem,try to kill people -see it is hard so change class to pyro -hold mouse1 and 'w' -kill someone -press 'G' after the kill -repeat -see everyone is writing: 'f2p w+1 noob' -give then no answer -continue killing -see everyone is rage quiting. -repeat this again and again -now you are getting close to victory! -get killed by a random crit -get autobalanced to the other team -loose -rage quit yourself too  11/10 best money-wasting hat simulator ever made!"
"One of my favourite games, but the latest update did decrease the quaity of gameplay. I would like to see more option to play with people in other countries ping doesn't matter people just want to play in America. Thanks."
 I love and hate Team Fortress 2 at the same time
It is a very bad game now. it used to be a very good game but now ether i can't get it to conect to steam and the servers have not updated. whaght a month and then get it
"Hmm, you want a review eh? Here's one.  If you own a computer, theres no reason that you shouldn't have this game downloaded. TF2, the game with titles such as barbie simulator, is one of valve's mod games. As its in valve's family of games, it has learnt its money sucking ability from it's older brother CS:GO by adding the recent 'gun-mettle' update. Its also a game where re-skins and hats decides the status you have in this game. Its not a game for the casuals, oh no, for when they come in they are called the Free-to-plays. This game is infested with these things. But, from this pit of F2Ps there rises up a champion, a victor who knows what its like to be a f2p, a legend that will destroy the pubs it encounters, a god among the Pay to plays. Like how you work hard to achieve goals he has worked hard. Mastering the things that are offered in this game. This person possess things far greater than the most expensive re-skin or hat that Gaben has generated. This person has skill. It won't be easy for any ordinary person to acheive such success,   But this person can be you.   What are you waiting for, play it champ. 11/10 would enjoy again."
"cool and perfect game for people who like teamwork, and theres alot of characters to play with and every character has his own way of playing plus every character has his own weakness, like spy weakness is pyro and sniper weakness is spy, very good game and perfect to me :D"
This game is awesome
Everything about this game is awesome. I highly recommend it.
i really really like this game and i would like moar items in it but one thing closed captions do not work in this game why?
we all know TF2 is a great game.we all praise volvo and gaben
Team Fortress 2... Sometimes I love you and sometimes I hate you. Good game with funny classes. :)  8/10
"This game is amazing. I haven't played any other game like it. If you download it, it will be a wild ride and a great fun game."
if you like funny shooters this is PERFECT and thats all i have to say this game is 10/10!!!
Ooooooooooh...Sexy sniper rifle in that heavys head :) 
"Awesome game! Just got an unusual, the whole thing is just amazing!"
"Hey, thats pretty good!"
"Ok, TF2 still uses Quicktime for windows for Replays, So Valve needs to fix it."
"the new TF2 format ♥♥♥♥ing sucks.   wait at every load screen for an eternity, play 1 match get kicked back out and have to wait all over again.   Valve, please go back to pre-tournament mode, this just isn't fun anymore!"
Absolutely incredible shooter. One of a kind. No-one can beat TF2
plz fix the bug
"This game is amazingly detailed and fun. Better yet, it's free! Would highly recommend this game! :)"
"My, my. I have got to say. This game is my favorite game of all time. It has no goal and is completely based off of skill which I LOVE. It's not like those other video games that has a goal that makes you wanting to 'need' to play more to grind out things. Instead in TF2 you can 'find' weapons. You will just receive different weapons randomly, though, some weapons will need you to unlock achievments to get. When I first got this game, I was intrigued in spy. A class that can disguise, cloak, and kill people with ease. Though, he requires a lot of mastering. He's hard to play as so I recommend mastering some other class before you go all willy-nilly playing spy for his intriguing factors that make him so interesting. After all, I AM a spy main and I highly recommend it. At first, the game may seem frustarating but after hours and hours spent into the game, it will make you a better player, kinda like me but I still kinda suck after almost 700 hours of playing the game. I used to be very neutral with game and now it's my favorite game. I can just play hours every day. Welp, thanks for reading my review! Also, the latest update had its pros and cons, I liked the xp system. :P"
this is the best game for free
great game
Some people need to $$$$ING apreciate what they have i HATE the haters and if you dont like the update deel with it.
when i strated playing tf2 i was soo happy and i liked valve and the community was soo nice that some of them helped me when i started the game and and the new updates and weapones and hats and many other things but in some updates i got disappointed like tough break and competitive matchmaking distroyed me from the inside but i still have faith in valve i am still playing the game for todday and i had 5 users or steam accounts one of them bieng playing tf2 for about 3000 hours !! i enjoyed the game and it game modes but today things changed see in the last update i get in tf2 waiting 1 min or 3 at least to get into a server and i see 1 or 2 hackers in the servers but not in every one but quite alot and they get all the kills or you lose the game and win some xp i have seen at least 4-5 hackers in the last game i played the past week dont get me wrong i love tf2 more than any other game but valve doesnt appreciate thier community and its love to the game soo i am asking valve and every one about this will valve ruturn to make tf2 alive again ? only god knows
"This game is just amazing, and who cares it's free!"
This is a good game nice stuff like Cosmetics and classes
I CAN TELL IM GOING TO WASTE MY LIFE AWAY ON THIS POORLY DESIGNED HAT SIMULATOR OH WELL GG
"The game is recommended. But it has fatal flaws.    The latest update was great...but what is an update without critisism. First and foremost, the lobby is just terrible. The statistics that tell you about the server/player count are useless. It reads 1077 servers nearby and I join a server with 500 ping? Next, it is downright unoriginal and it is copied off of MvM lobby style. The only new thing is the background. And when you finally join a   competitve   server, most of your fellow comrades are laggy and ragequit, some argue and few are downright terrible. I joined a competitive game   somehow, it was the same server/map.   and I thought it was a simple 6v6 but towards the end, it had become a 3v3.   The teamwork found in the so-called 'competitive' is much worse than the teamwork found in casual...or maybe it's just me. Disorginized and not so great. In fact, competitive felt alot like the casual   or vice versa     Casual is not casual. I am not having fun evrytime I play this 'Casual'. In fact, I have an adrenaline rush equal to when I play competitive.   minus the rage   I trying to keep this as short as possible but the update is not overall bad. Nor is it great.   So Valve, I beg of you, please fix the problems I have and please keep casual casual and competitive fun/thrilling. Much love...a tf2 mediocore."
"This is a good game when you're in one of those 'I have all these games but I've played them all too much' moment. It's really good for a quick bit of fun and has all sorts of things to keep you entertained without having to put much thought into the game. I personally don't see the game as a game I'd play much alone and try to progress, but many do play the game as a primary game. I think it's more for messing around with your friends on a game marathon to waste time, or hop into a match and play for an hour you have to kill. This game is extremly good for a free title and it doesn't have that horrible 'free-to-play' feeling to it that ruins most free games for me.  I don't see any reason not to have this game in your library, it won't take up to much space and you are sure to get some play out of it."
"Now, this game has changed so much over the past 8 years, but I have to say it is still my favorite FPS. I bought this game back in 2008 with Orange Box off the shelves and I have a TON of memories and friends I have met via this game, A few of my closest friends I met on here. But, I haven't seen an update this terrible, well... ever on this game. I do have a lot of faith for valve as I enjoy almost every game they had released to fix this horrible nonsense so It still gets my up vote."
i like this game a lot it is really cool  also: bunny hats
I just want the achievment
"World's 1# Hat and Clothes Simulator.  It was a great game once, full of possibilities, but it has been slowly eliminated and is nothing but a shadow of it's former self as of now. I still 'recommend' it, but it's nothing compared to what it was."
Just play it
"TF2 is the best thing I have ever played. The balance of all nine classes is just amazing, and I have never ever seen something like this. TF2 was alive for nine years. I hope that it will last longer. MUCH longer. Let's have an in-depth review: Team Fortress 2 is a free-to-play game. It has 9 classes and a pretty big loan of game modes. Each class has a plenty of weapons, which have different characteristics. Stock weapons are the most reliable ones, but others are more situational. I would recommend people to play with stock first, and after understanding the game mechanics and basics of playing each class switch to other weapons, which are most useful to you and style you are playing. TF2 also has cosmetic system. It allows players to make THEIR class look as THEY want. Not for free, though. Talking about community, I'd like to say that community is kinda friendly (most players). TF2 has a great life even beyond the gameplay: it has it's own economy with currency, changing prices and all other stuff. Overwatch was released kinda recently, and people instantly called it 'TF2 killer'. Overwatch did almost nothing to tf2, though. The main problem of TF2 is its publisher and developer - Valve. They can ruin all the fun in the game in few hours. The last update, Meet your Match, did COLOSSAL damage to TF2. Valve. Removed. Pubs. That's everything I have to say. Valve removed pubs, a.k.a. fun in TF2, a.k.a. reason TF2 lived 9 years. Community called 'Meet your Match' 'Go competetive or f*ck you' update. That describes it very nicely. The spirit of the game became more competetive-ish. Colors in the menus, design of all that stuff - everything wants to make you COMPETE with other players. TF2 is now all about competition.  Looks like Valve just don't know why people play Overwatch, and try to make TF2 a clone of Overwatch (I just don't understand why, people were playing TF2 since 2007(!), and Overwatch didn't really do any harm to Team Fortress. And now Valve try to turn an older game into a clone of a new game. Wow. Just wow.). Valve removed pubs and made 'Casual' instead of them. They don't know that Team Fortress is all about casuality. In pubs, there were plenty of players, you could always choose mode, map, and all that stuff. Sorry for returning to Overwatch once again, but let's just take a view into an average game: how much people are fooling around in Overwatch? One or two. How much people are fooling around in TF2? Like half of server. Extreme Rancho Relaxo, Box trot spies blocking the cart, friendlies, gibuses that kill friendlies because they don't know a lot about TF2 - it was AWESOME. It was the reason TF2 was played 9 years straight. Right now pubs are removed and I don't think Valve would bring it back. I wish I could go back in time to the day TF2 was released and play it non-stop, 24 hours every day and 7 days every week. Play it non-stop until it dies. Right now, TF2 is on the brink of death. People quit Team Fortress two.I think we need to do EVERYTHING WE CAN, to revive TF2. Call your friends to play, do anything you want, but please, help TF2 live.  I played a bit on skial. I don't regret. It was so refreshing. I recommend you to play Skial too, it gives us the experience that pubs gave us. That's all I can say.    UPD: There are two petitions on the internet, one about returning pubs:  https://www.change.org/p/valve-bring-back-old-casual-tf2?recruiter=565803233&amp;utm_source=petitions_show_components_action_panel_wrapper&amp;utm_medium=copylink  And one about making Valve listen to the community:  https://www.change.org/p/gabe-newell-help-us-make-valve-think-about-tf2-updates-before-they-release-them?recruiter=565803233&amp;utm_source=share_for_starters&amp;utm_medium=copyLink "
I love this game
"TF2 is a fun game however the amount of vulgarity expressed in its chat is appalling. Realistically, some profanity now and then is understandable and expected however the vulagarity is often at an X-rated level. Obviously done for pointless, empty shock-value and when you consider the possibility of young players this becomes a real problem and a distraction to the overall gameplay. Unfortunately, the biggest problem is that Valve does virtually nothing about this.   Fortunately, Overwatch by Bliizzard doesn't have this problem and is techically a superior game anyhow. Sure its price is steep but in the long-run well worth it. I guess you get what you pay for with TF2."
Game is A pain at first due to everyone picking on you because you're a noob but it pays off once you played for awhile
Am I the only one who has noticed that there are a ♥♥♥♥♥on of bot postive reviews? Funny how they only started to show up after this update.
Uninstalled after Meet Your Match
"3000 hours and this game is still as good as when I first started playing.  10/10 in my book, but is it in yours? The game is free to play so why not try it out for yourself? I'm sure you'll enjoy it!"
"When I saw this game, it became my favorite. Since then, I've played tf2 more than any other game. I highly recommend this game. It is amazing how this game is surviving strong even after 8 years."
"Valve ruined the game when they removed vanilla, steam/valve run servers. This meet your match update is killing the game. I used to love TF2, after this update it's gone to ♥♥♥♥, Please fix this valve. You have to go back."
Its fun and the best game i've ever played
"Good game,so many servers and best of all FREE-TO-PLAY"
Good things come to an end.
I love this game! It can become frustrating at times but that is my problem.
great game
"Forget this game, move onto something else.   I have played this game for a while *different account* and I am ready to say that this game should just die already. I mean, Valve time and time again neglect this game and when they HAVE to come back to make an update it is obvious that they do not care for the needs of the game and community. They buff weapons that were already good and nerf the ones that were already bad, make horrible changes for the servers, make little updates, and never listen to good advice. I mean for crying out loud if a few content creators and such actually could put all their content into the game, it would be about 3x as big immediately (good content obv).    I don't get how making a game casual for so long then making it completely competitive for the game because now most people who actually are into the game just go on casual to stomp people and warm up for their competitive game. Hell, even community servers have that, (you know, the rares ones that arent filled with bad addons and adds to make the game horrible).   I like the game concept and it is definitely a game I used to be able to hop onto and play, But it has just become more apparent over the years that Valve couldn't care less."
the banta drips from teh salt
Nice Fun Good Game!
Cool game 
Most People Complain about the Difficulty of this game But once you've played an hour of it you become interested
Be A Heavy And Cry Medic!!!!!! Or Somehow Make A Rocket Propell You Up! Or A Sticky Bomb Kaboom I Am Flying Somehow ? Or Be A P&amp;&amp;&amp;ed Scottish Demoman! Or A Fast Running Scout! Insane Doctor! Or A Sentry Building Engineer! Marksman Aussie Saying 'G'day Mate!'  Or A Weird Man Or Woman Pyromaniac!

I wasted lots of time on this  Also it has guns  Oops meet your match now I automatically have to thumb it down      /sarcasm
"  Nice gameplay, nice graphics"
"to all 6 year old cod fanboys maybe this game does have unrealistic graphics and silly hats but this game has nothing that cod will never have: team work, good community, its free :3, it dosent have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dlcs (for example in cod dlcs are like that:a few guns and weapons and some maps that looks like the original maps)  and also cod has no emotion and all the charcters look grey and lifeless and tf2 has some emotion put to work. ya know if its an fps game it dosent have to be just like cod youre, cod 'mlg skillz' wont help you here. in the end tf2 is a great game and i rate to it 10/10"
Best Free-To-Play game ever.
"Great first person shooter!  Team fortress is a fun multishooter with a great art style. I love teamfortress 2, it is my favorite game on steam. The game's community is also great part of the game. I recommend it to others!"
"Favorite game/Hat simulator of all time, Best Free to play game of all time as well. Although this game devours my wallet.. its worth it.. gaben is love, gaben is life."
"TF2 is a really well balanced FPS, it has customizable classes which can make for a ton of fun. its graphics suit its gameplay style and no class seems underpowered or overpowered 10/10"
"This game is great, Tf2 is whacky fps game,but the meet your match update has made it worst. "
"good game mate, can say after playing it for a while. (I lost my last acc with 1000h)"
"Overall i love this game. I've been playing it since it came out on the orange box on xbox 360. But recently there was an update known as meet your match. This update.......was the worst thing that has ever happened to a game. It ruined the game for me. It's sad to say that after all this time playing it i've become bored of it. The Meet Your Match update needs to be terminated. It has taken everything I loved about tf2 and threw it away. Hopefully Valve will see the feedback they are getting and respond. If one day they completely remove the meet your match update I will start playing again and I will leave a positive review, but until that day comes...im done with Team Fortress 2."
lots of fun
"Fun to play to wind down, or release pent up rage by blowing out some idiot's brains. After a while the maps get old though, and the only thing keeping it interesting to play when you're feeling fine is killing people with meme weapons."
very good with a loads of comical laughs 
"Team Fortress 2 is a great addicting game for a wide range of players. It has many components that bring players in. The first person shooting, economy, and great community. The Economy and trading really took me into the game, it's one of my passions for tf2. The community is i believe one of the best. Every week I will here stories of how another player just gave away a free unusual. It's great! So when you first try the game you know there will be people there to help ou learn the basics. All in all, this game is worth getting. It's free so if you dont like it feel free to uninstall it! It wont cost anything, but i know you will love it!"
Good game is verry verry! cool :D AND IS CREATE FOR GABEN :3
"i find this game to be real good and unique thing to play if you ever wanted to play a game that had the perfect amount of guns, fun and action and you whether you have little or lots of time to play you can always find joy out of this game. from trigger happy scout to backstabbing spy i enjoy the fact that there are many features, weapons and customization like the costumes. in tf2 you have 2 teams 2 modes, red and blue team, and multiplayer and co-op mode. co-op holds a special little thing to it but you need a ticket to play so i suggest you pick up a copy of tf2 and its free and play."
"Fast paced, firstperson shooter, sometime available in thirdperson. Plenty of gamemodes, including custom gamemodes and modded servers. I would reccomend this game to the public as it is fun, addicting, and rewarding!"
10/10 would team fortress again  team fortress 2
Really nice game!
one of the best first person shooters ive ever played 
its awsome the best game on steam and just the fact its free makes it even better
This game does for me what SKyrim doesn't.
"hands down best free to play game on steam, once u pick this up you would not see the sunshine again! welcome to the dark side :P"
"I really enjoy this game, it is filled with excitement especially when played with your mates."
It is very good game whis lot of hats.That game make you smile

It's good 
Play this game !
"Team Fortress 2 is a fantastic FPS where you can play as any 9 of set classes these are: Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy. There are many gamemodes such as CTF and Payload, you can find what gamemod to play by clicking 'Play' ontop of TF2 gamemods you also have mods, mods are gamemods made by players some mods inclued: x10 or JailBreak. Team Fortress 2 is a really fun game and I'd recondmend it to any one looking for a Free to play FPS."
I was least exited about this game then my friends made me download it and now wow it\'s a great f2p game tbh. 9 different classes to choose from and each one with special weapons. TF2 isn't any regular fps. give it a try ;)
Just Great 
This game is god like sure theres annoying moments but is that going to stop thousands of hours of fun if so then ♥♥♥♥ OFF! and enjoy
Team fortress 2 is a exellent game and has the most game hours on my profile.And i definally reconmend it to anyone who likes cartoony games and fps titles.
10/10 Could shoot a rocket at my feet to fly.
"this game is awwsome. with two w's. with its own economy, art style, and game play, no wonder they don't want to make a third! its near perfection as it is!"
this is an amazing game its very easy to pick up and play and easy to get addicted to. its free to play but you can buy things such as weapons hats and taunts but this is not a pay to win game you might be a person who has bought nothing in the game and you can go take on a person who has bought lots of things and you have a chance to win unlike some other games where the person who buys things is the best. 9/10
"This game is all that and a bag of chips. its wacko, its insane, but most of all its unique. ITS AMAZING because this game has soooooooooooooooooo much to offer like backstabbing people with what I call a voodoo kebob stick (the wonga prick) , caving someones skull in with none other than a flippin` frying pan, or just throwing a bottle of urine on someone. Even though this game does BREAK LOGIC LAWS because if you shoot a rocket at your feet you would explode to bits but tf2 says well it doesn`t hurt that bad but if you jump when the rocket goes off you will go flying through the air (same with the sticky bombs) this game is just so crazy you can`t keep up with it. and then the stuff about the mercenaries, heck the frikin` engineers name is DELL (you know like the computer) and the heavy eats a frikin sandvich and all you can think about is the sound he makes when he eats well here it is: OM NOM NOM OM NOM. he can`t even eat without makin` me wet my pants. it always makes me wonder what the of him slurping up some pepsi. Heck if you think I hate this game your are the most stupid person on earth I LOVE IT"
"Team Fortress 2 is a 'bucket-list' game; One of those games you have to play. This game brings fun and competitive gameplay to the table, with many weapons and 9 mercs you can play as. Also the game includes customization, so feel free to look however you want!"
Team Fortress 2 ( TF2 ) is a great game up to the gameplay to the updates tf2 is a true game that everyone needs the pyro see's everything as a fairytale and the spy is sly and sneeky the grafics are 10/10 i recommend you get it it has even been called ' The worlds first war themed hat simulator'.
1 Word... AWESOME
"TF2 is just all the shooters need to be... killing with a fish, killing with a pan and trowing ♥♥♥♥ to your enemies... if CoD have that... I will probably going to play it.. but I prefeer the hat simulator :3... just play TF2 and you will never ever play other FPS multiplayer again"
pgood classes feel different botiful gfx fun free dl it pl0x gud gaem
"eh its alright, still feels like i should play it a bit more to actually get a feel for it tho"
"Not only did it create a world of endless items, but it also creating a (sort of horrifying) fandom that litteraly stole my eyes. I play this atleast 1 hour everyday. If you want a free, fast-pace game, then tf2 is the game for you."
Team Fortress 2 is a free onlone game with amazing graphics and textures
"Very nice game, i like it!"
love this game definitaly try it out 
"I love the game,especially the scout I've been waiting to play this game for a long time and it turned free to play I was even happier,best game ever,keep on updating the game"
"Nice, nice game, but hackers is on this game :c 9/10 ;D"
I RECOMMEND SO MUCH PPL TO PLAY DIS!!!
'Moist and delicious' ~Heavy
"8/10   Quality game my friend, 'QUALITY'"
cool
"This game is very fun for beginning fps players because it has a wide viriety of game modes and can be played multiplayer or single player. I would give it 4/5. Just a little comment though, if this gets boring, get Counter Strike Global Offencive."
Tim forter's why you canceled the Hkonsl
"well its been 2 years since i first played tf2 so why not review it?. in tf2 you play as 9 classes the scout who is the fastest but has lowest health, the solider does a lot of damage but he's rockets can kill him very easy'll, the pyro who has a flame and kill from the dead but cant attack from long range,the demoman can blow things but has a terrible aim ( i couldn't think of a weakness for him so just said that). the heavy who has a ♥♥♥♥ing mini gun (holy ♥♥♥♥ that's awesome) but is the slowest,engi as community call him can build sentry guns and dispenser's and other ♥♥♥♥ like that but isn't the best in terms combat,the medic can heal people and pop uber with makes him and who ever he's healing bulit proof but doesn't have the best time attacking, the sniper who has well a sniper but is easy'll killed do to he's low health and not so fast speed,and finally the spy the can sneak around by cloaking and be becoming disguised as other player's also spy has kill move if you want call it that named the back stab,spy has low health and a extreme weakness to the pyros flames ."
"This game is a fun,cartoon shooter that is great even for call of duty players.This game mostly shines in multiplier, online modes, with it's creating a server,trying out all of the classes,trolling everybody,getting all of the many of the over 500 achievements,just being a hacker or just a jerk(especially to friends).Also the many of many butt loads of hats,weapons,taunts or just stuff you can get in this game is crazy.Making this game have tons of replay ability.But, if you don't have money to play or the time to just sit down and play people are mostly going to kill you a lot.Also,when you have all of the weapons you want the game could get a little boring.But when you are just playing this game is a ton of fun. I would give this game a 9.5 out of 10(with 10 being the best and 1 being the worst)."
This game is great. It is hours of fun and the different classes add a ton of variety to the gameplay
  this is the best game ever highly addictive
BEST GAME EVER LOVE IT
I think it is a great game 8/8 mate
"This game is maybe the best thing since sliced bread. Definitely should give it a try. Good game, and solid everything, it's a decent title to pick up."
i love this game
Well Lets See TF2 Is A Free To Play Game With Cool Hats/Misc/Weapons Many Maps And Many Other Style of Servers Like Versus Saxton Hale/Death Run/Parkour/ManvsRobot And Many Other :).This Game Is Realy Awesome And If You Play It With Your Friend Its Even More Cool Because Its Fun Playing With Your Friends Instead From Playing Alone So Give It A Try =D. Thanks For Your Anttention I Hope You Like It And If You Need A Friend Then Im  Your Guy xD.
Its Tons of Fun 1st Best Game out there :)
This game is sick due to its awesome fps viewing of it 
Team Fortress 2 is an amazing multiplayer FPS game that is great to play with friends! IT'S ALSO FREE!
Stupid new things
Great FPS Shooter Game. Trading Addiction. What all games need I rate this a 9.7/10
"I would talk about why the competitive update has ruined a lot of aspects of what made TF2 good, but I can't even get into a game, so I can't. Well done Valve. See you when Half Life 3 comes out.  Okay, I'll go into a bit more detail. TF2 was a great F2P shooter. Even if I don't play it as much as I used to, I always looked forward to what would come next since was always able to satisfy with content updates, even if some of them were a bit dissapointing *cough* End of the Line *cough* It's also not very often that you see a game that's so open to the community; from custom maps, game modes, and even community made taunts, weapons, and cosmetics, TF2 is still one of the most open F2P games I've ever seen, more so than their competitor, Overwatch. In fact, if Valve had stuck to their guns and kept the game as it was before, they'd still be able to compete because of how unique the game is compared to other games LIKE Overwatch. I mean, come on, Blizzard doesn't even allow Overwatch porn, so how do you expect them to be as open to the community as TF2 is? A lot of the stuff I adore about TF2 is all community driven, whether it be TF2 inspired animations, or the many creations that I said above.  It's sad for me to say that this update convinced me to uninstall the game, which says a lot considering that I've had the game installed ever since I first started playing it. Valve could have easily kept the game as it was and just stapled a more competitive variation of it like they did with Mann vs Machine and the other modes they had in beta. They didn't have to overhaul the game in the way that they did. TF2 is nothing like Overwatch, and Overwatch is nothing like TF2. It has similar modes and artstyles, yes, but they are still none alike. All Valve did was create an entirely different game that alienates the people that played TF2 as it was meant to be played, and that's what ultimately screwed them over the second they released this update. It would've been perfectly to have all of this if it was its own unique mode in the game, not plastered onto the entirety of it.  I'm willing to give the game one more chance if Valve learns from this, takes the game back to the way it was before, and keep the competitive mode exactly that: a mode. As of now, however, I have lost any motivation to want to continue playing this game. Once again, well done Valve. You've ruined what was once a perfect game and turned it into what it was trying not to be in the first place."
"Before the lastest update, it's my favourite game, what now? ♥♥♥♥ this game, casual mode ruined the whole thing."
This is a very fun game for everyone. There is no doubt it's bad except for the XBOX version when microsoft won't let valve update the game. 
"i used to love this game, its hilarious community. how many people always played every night i always played. the community servers that were always filled. I used to love seeing those idlers, thinking that they were all stupid and stuff, how they just sat around doing nothing, i used to have an unusual hat, and i used to really enjoy this game. Now, this game has fallen apart, what happened to just clicking a button and joining any random game, having fun, and just going with it. why do people now get a punishment from leaving a game, this never used to happen when i used to play. One day i thought * oh, im gonna try TF2 again after a really long time of not playing it *, everyone was extremely tryhard, community servers are now a pain to access and majority are empty. the fun, enjoyable adorable game that was a complete fun mess is now gone. its all strict format. Its been 4 years since ive touched TF2 ( true, maybe the reason i stopped playing TF2 was because my favorite server just ended up dying out and i was one of the few people still on it and i just stopped ) and TF2 is looking even worse than before. Take it from me, someone who has spend over 700 hours in this game, someone who used to adore this game, how silly and fun the community was. Now TF2 looks like a complete ♥♥♥♥ show. Honestly this game used to be the most fun game ive every played."
This game be SpecHATular.
Probably the best free game out there. Even if the valve maps become boring theres hundreds of maps out there with varieties of game types.
I like to play Team Dressup 2
"Team Fortress 2 is a very fun game. It's fun, unique, and strays away from your usual shooter."
This game has been part of my life
Probably the best multiplayer fps of all time. Millions of hours of potential.
How to put this game in a nutshell: W+M1 People who take medkits when they don't need it despite the fact that you're right next to the medkit and have 1 health.
"The 'Meet Your Match' update made this game literally unplayable. It takes more than 10 minutes to get into a single game in  casual  mode. You can't choose what map you want to play, and you can't choose what gamemode you want to play. You get penalties for match abandonment in  casual ."
"The 7/8/16 update is complete crap. They went from near instant matchmaking to YOU CAN'T GET A GAME EVER. All this so we could get some experience point system? NOBODY WANTS THIS YOU TOOLS.  I just spent a couple bucks on taunts, and now apparently I'm gonna have to stop playing."
"WHAT IN THE ACTUAL ♥♥♥♥ IS THIS UPDATE? IM LIKE WAITING FOREVER TO PLAY A GAME, GOOD LUCK COMPETING WITH OVERWATCH WHEN YOUR GAME IS NOW ♥♥♥♥♥♥"
"Would have recommended this game until july 2016 meat your match update. looks like valves has met it's match... the morons managing this once great game, we asked for comptetative NOT matchmaking, and the fact you replaced valve pubs with the, load of sh*t, casual matchmaking system just proves my point.   I seriously encorage valve to shake up the tf2 dev team and fire the g*d damned son of a b*tch that thought replacing official valve pubs with casual matchmaking was a good idea, bring back official pubs or i'm done for good with this once fantastic game (now a steaming pile of SH*T).  GET YOUR HEAD SORTED VALVE.   DO NOT LISTEN TO PRO COMPETATIVE PLAYERS, THEY KNOW JACK SH*T ABOUT WHAT'S GOOD FOR US ALL."
"Dont wanna play comp? too bad, you get pseudo-comp. Dont wanna finish this game? too bad you get penalized. Want to play on a valve server? Too bad play on this add-ridden community one. Want to play some of the 'casual'? too bad, wait an hour.  Valve ♥♥♥♥ed up with this update."
"As you can see by my time played, I have played TF2 for a long time. what do I have to say about the 'meet your match' update? its ok. but it has some terrible additions. The balancing is decent, but god, THE MATCHMAKING.  Casual is a crappy version of competitive where you cant leave without a penalty. ON CASUAL. CS:GO doesnt have that?? why the fresh hell did valve decide that hyper strict pub servers were a good idea? No votekick, no autobalance, no quickplay, no midgame joining. everthing you knew about valve pub servers has died!  This is literally the most annoying update that has ever graced my computers hard drive"
"They had something good going. Pretty damn good. Now its gotta be all this matchmaking and rank systems in a CASUAL game. If it's not broken, don't fix it. They don't know what that means."
"Nice game, really love it :)"
"The new update isn't lowspec friendly and just turns the game into csgo. But instead you're forced to go on dx9 or else you cant play comp. WHAT ♥♥♥♥ IS THAT VALVE? I think valve just made a mistake because I think this is how tf2 is gonna crash and burn. I know people have been hyped for this, but we didn't expect such a mistake from valve. We wanted a new gamemode that added matchmaking and could be for anyone. Instead, half of the tf2 community has left because the people who play tf2 are low spec players. This is the first time i say this but, atleast the ♥♥♥♥ing uninstall button works."
Competive updates wants me to pay 10$ for a pass... Welp nice knowing ya'll...
After the new update you have to wait 10-20 minutes to conect at a server... Please... 20 minutes to conect at a server? You kiding... And after update the game look like a ♥♥♥♥... Dont donload this game... It become very bad...
"The July 2016 update is the biggest dissapointment in my 27-year long PC gaming history... I'd never believe I could give negative review to my most favorite game, but Valve... you ♥♥♥♥ed it up!!"
"This is a game for those who want insane gore with disney graphics and steriotypical characters, if you want to do something different, fun, or strategic, PLAY THIS AWESOME GAME"
"hi all   first i must say thank you all for this board so i can keep my son away from nasty stuff the devil puts on this earth   as grateful as i am i am here to tell you all to ban team fortress 2 (abbreviated as TF2) for the following reasons   i discovered about it this weekend when my 15 year old son charlie brought home his friend and they were playing on his friend's laptop a game where it's nothing but killing, bad words, god bashing, anti-american propaganda, and worst of all HOMOSEXUALITY!! they all are posed to look threatening (i guess that's what boys like these days)   there is also blantent homosexuality (when the doctor heals his patients they all say things like 'i love this doctor' or 'get behind me doctor!')   they made a character that looks like a soldier and he talks about god's world being his ('this is my world, you are not welcome in my world!') when i heard this i was MORBIDLY SHOCKED and appalled and ashamed of my son and he knew it   i was wondering why my son was getting into fights and after i saw this i banned him from ever seeing his friends   if you see your child playing this, tell them to uninstall it and watch him do it!!!   hope this helps parents out so your child doesn't stray far from god!"
It's amazing The graphics The Funny stuff and all the Taunts Yes I do Recommend this game.
this game has it all.   Thats all i have to say.
This game makes me nut buckets.
"Team Fortress 2 (commonly abbreviated as TF2) is a First Person Shooter game unlike any other. There is no 'Storyline', plot, or cumbersome AI support characters. There is only you, your guts, your weapon, your team, and the opposing team. A wide selection of maps tests you ability to adapt to new surroundings, blind spots, and pitfalls. Different and unique gamemodes challenge you to use various strategies to achieve that victory everyone vies for. Nine classes, each with their perks and weaknesses, encourage you to find your perfect fit- and then to improve upon it. No matter what happens in war, anything and anyone can change the tide.  In this game, everyone has a chance, but not everyone has the patience.  This game is  not  for those that cannot handle losing or dying in-game. Like any other game, it takes hours, months, years to master, and even those with thousands of hours may insist that they still do not know everything about TF2. This game is  not  for those who are lazy or purposely idiotic. Cheaters, Abusers, Microphone Spammers, and Hackers are strongly despised, and Valve inputs effort to ensure a safe yet fun playing experience.  The Steam Workshop for TF2 keeps content fresh, exciting, and inspirational. Vote on your favorite weapons and maps, and Valve  may  officially add them to the game. Even if they do not, some items can be still enjoyed without official use. Some private server owners, for example, may host maps that are not officiated by Valve.  A plethora of weapons and cosmetics allow creative freedom.  Each weapon has its drawbacks and benefits, much like the classes themselves. Choose which weapons will complement your strategies best. Cosmetics give your player-character a special look and feel. Whether you want to intimidate the enemy, humor your allies, or just look cool, TF2 has cosmetics to help.   Note that most cosmetics are not free.You can purchase them through the Steam Community Market or external sites like  http://www.marketplace.tf . I am not responsible for irresponsible purchasing habits.    Why wait? Team Fortress 2 is free, forever. Give it a go, and grab your   virtual   gun."
I'm done with this ♥♥♥♥
"Oh boy. What an update. Valve managed to remove a big chunk of the charm, that made TF2 one of my favorite games. TF2, for the most part, is about having fun. Winning and skill are secondary objectives. Don't get me wrong, I think matchmaking is a great idea and it adds a lot to TF2, but it cannot, and will never, replace pubs.  Being able to join specific maps, the ability to invite friends mid game and the immediate connection are the obvious things that are missing.  But the whole atmosphere, the spirit, that made TF2 unique, is gone. Everything is a lot more serious, no silly spycrabs, fat scouts or lazy engies. Suddenly, everybody is under pressure and if you don't commit to the game, you are a waste of everybodys time, and people will let you know that. I could go on for hours. In the end, the lack of lightheartedness and easyness it what kills it for me. I like comp. I like matchmaking, but why drop pubs entirely?   Let's hope Valve fixes this asap."
"Its awsome,FPS,theres achievements,AND ITS FREE!!!!!! Go get it,NOW!"
"If you want to keep your grades up and not waste your life away, I wouldn't recommend this to you. But if you don't give a ♥♥♥♥, get this game. The multiplayer is amazing, most of the community is awesome, and the game itself is hilarious!  Also, it's addictive af. Like, really. I said I was gonna play for 30 minutes then do my HW and instead I spent 4 hours playing.  20/10."
"This game is Great! Well Animated, Lots of new stuff every now and then. and HATS! this game is good for someone who like animated shooter games."
It's good game and I was playing it one year before I ''bought it.'' It is one of the best games what I have plaeyd! Awesome work!
It was a good game. Best free to play game.  Then this update. No more fun. It's dead.  R.I.P. TF2 2007-2016
"My favorite online multiplayer game of all time has been rendered completely unplayable. You know better then this Valve, you're not EA. Make it right, bring back quickplay, bring back votekick, bring back autobalance. #maketf2greatagain"
"Game used to be really fun, my favorite multiplayer game (except for the Dead Ringer). But this whole thing with Mobile Authenticator completely ruined it since I can't play competitive (which I've been waiting for). I can't even play casual now because I can't get my new number on the mobile authenticator."
this game has hats and u can shoot...its pretty good
"I spent too much time and money on this game, fun game anyway. Also parts of the community are pretty carcinogenic"
teem fortess 2 is so repetive and boring der realy is nuthing to do becus it so boring and reptive saim thing to stomp noobs o yea to many noobs this game imposibol to win with ♥♥♥♥ teem ful of noob pryos and eginers this game suks soooo boring and repiteve and pay to win stupit cosmos are costly
Awesome Game!!! Truly a Classic! Would Recomend!
"Probably one of the best games I have ever played. It has a great community (aside from the occasional squeaker), incredible gameplay, beautiful graphics, and a weapon system that is diverse, but rather than one weapon being particularly 'better' than another, they are more adaptibe to different play styles, something that is not very popular in games these days. Although there are players who have been playing exponentially longer than me, I usually feel like I can get a decent number of points without having to intensely practice. Overall, Team Fortress 2 is just an incredible game, and I couldn't reccomend it more."
this is an awesome game
i love this game its really fun it has some up and downs but other then that its a fun game 10/10 love this game but the xbox version is a bit off it needs updates its getting frustrating how some times when my computer doesnt work i have the less updated version of tf2 if valve or gabenewel (cant spell XD) is reading this please update tf2 for the xbox because i enjoy playing tf2 with the controller and obviosly that cant happend because the owners of this game cant update so i cant enjoy tf2 for the xbox so im speaking for all the players who play tf2 for the xbox please update the xbox version of tf2
This game is one of those game where you can play over and over again without getting board. I love this game and it helped me kill time along the way
the update is trash
I love the game
"Great first person shooter, AND also a dancing/taunting simulater, also great if you have a fetish for hats. I think thats all that needs to be said, back to playing Team Fortress 2!"
it is a great game.
"This game is great, i could easly clock in over 1000 hours in this game and still be able to have fun with. If you're looking for a good free to play game that will be able to keep your attention for hundreds of hours, then download Team Fortress 2 for sure"
It's gotten kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ after the ''Competitive play'' update...
RIP TF2
BEST GAME EVER MADE IN WORLD! NICE GAME NICE MULTIPLAYER! NICE MAPS! NICE COSMETICS! NICE HATS ! :DDDDDDDD
"this game is amazing, bit hard to defeat users with only stock items but you can always start by fighting bots"
Hatty Hattington approves.
"The game was great fun, but valve killed it.   Oh and im not gonna explain how they killed it, just read patch notes or what other people are saying, Im just here to warn you to NOT touch this game, despite my hours time.   Good job valve."
"Hey would you like a fun casual game? Well keep looking, the recent update removed a lot of the fun casual bits of this game. This update tried to turn TF2 into Overwatch, but it failed. Maybe in month or two Valve will fix this, so you might wanna check back in every now in then to see if they fixed the game. Unless Valve changes things I wouldn't recomend this game in its current state."
"The Game is an fun Free-2-play with 9 classes (scout, soldier, pyro, demoman, heavy, engenier, medic, sniper and spy) . Game is about shoting no sh*t XD. Good graphics very friendly comunity and lot and lot more. very much of weapon choice and cosmetics. There are few modes like Payload, Ctf, Ctp, payload race, Koth and the new competetive mode (paid mode). There are cosmetics, decoreted weapons, weapons, ... to sell and buy on market. For me that was a nice time to play Team Fortress 2 with my friends 10/10."
Ruined my aim in CS:GO     11/10    Would derank again
id hate to say but the meat you match update ruind this game heck i keap seeing noobs getting match with pros way to often. the matchmaking stinks it doesent even work
"Eh.... The new update kinda made it so TF2 is now a CS:GO-ish competetive game, it is no longer the fun, quirky game that everyone made those hilarious, (but stupid) SFM's off of... The wait times for the 'Casual' modes takes FOREVER, for instance. But yea, its still fun, IF you can handle the new update..."
"Team Fortress 2 offers a simple proposition: Throw a wall of humanity at a given objective and see what happens. The result is unimaginably entertaining and seemingly never gets old. The addition of item drops offer variety, but does not become a hinderance in the sense that you should feel the need to do 'homework' before jumping into a game.  In fact, the ability to jump into a game is arguably TF2's greatest strength. Yes, there are classes with different abilities, and there are tutorials that will introduce you to the basics, but the game is simple enough to be able to learn by doing, and the frantic pace/ability to change classes between deaths will allow for quick experimentation to find your niche. Data on your performance with each class in loading screens are a nice way to recieve feedback if you're looking for it. Perhaps the best indicator of the emphasis on fun over compeition is the inclusion of kills but no deaths. There's really no way to tell if the guy sitting at 150 kills has it because they're god's gift to TF2 or because they've been playing for 6 hours straight, because there's no other frame of reference. This is a good thing because the goals of TF2 are immediate: Get the flag, push the cart, kill the guys wearing different clothing.  The versatility of the format is also on display with the addition of a co-op mode: Mann vs. Machine. This, arguably, requires a bit more knowledge of the classes to successfully battle back a horde of robots, but also provides a new level of fun in the more tight knit group which is ideally composed of friends or agreeable strangers.  With the inclusion of new items and holiday game modes, TF2 continues to be just as fun to play as it was the very first day you log in. Given the fact that it's free to play this really feels like a title someone should have tried at least once, and will continue to offer pure fun on afternoons where you simply can't make up your mind or have grown bored of other titles."
"This is game always helps me when I got nothing to do, and when I am bored, thanks valve :)."
I don't think I've played enough to give a fair view yet.
So... i have decided to give a last chance to the competitive mode and casual mode since im a huge fan of this game...  My entire team just said: ZCrew this... let the other team win...  THEY 'APPED US... SADISTICALLY  My advice...  DON'T WASTE SPACE IN YOUR HARD DRIVE WITH THIS FAQUIN MESS...  DELETE IT IF YOU HAVE IT... IS NOT WORTH IT...
This is a really fun first person shooter!
"Recommened. Its nice and you don't find many hackers on it and if you find you will have fun killing them untill they ragequit, but some of the valve servers got alot of good players wich may not be good for newcomers but it is still a very nice game and you can make friends and play or trade your way up to the nicest hats and weapons!"
I think TF2 is an awesome game! 
Its all about the hats!
This Game Is Recommended cause its Free and it is Alot to do in this game like custom map and gamemode. Plss if u tell this game sucks plss try it Like 24 Hours
"Update 2: Valve, you dont understand, do you? We dont want you to fix casual, we want the pubs back,  tf2team: People want new weapons, huh? Well we will delete pubs and replace them with casual, nobody asked for it? We dont give a ♥♥♥♥ as soon as people give us the money, hey we think heavy is op, and pyro is weak as ♥♥♥♥, lets nerf heavy, and buff pyro, what do you say? Nobody asked for too? Who cares? Hey look, overwatch is out! Lets copy it, but make it much ♥♥♥♥♥ier! 2018: mvm removed"
this is very good game
"Best. Game. Ever.  PROS +9 Classes +Wonderful graphics and great remake of tfc +classes are balanced now, each with their own weaknesses and powers +lots and lots of weaponry +stranges, genuine, + +Hats and unusuals +steam market +steam workshop +Vac  CONS -uncasing  NO GAMEPLAY CONS  Overall, just get it. It is completely free, and a fun game. There are a lot of great maps there as well, and lots of fun servers. 200 hours of my time were on achievement_idle_apg"
Tf2 Is a free first person shooter and is good
What can be said..... 1500 hours and a whole lot of random crits later and here I am. Thanks for the gift of tf2 gaben   10/10 I dont know where I would be without a community and a game this strong!
the manifest destiny
best game 10/10 would ♥♥♥♥ around on again :3
"I'm pretty sure I have more hours than it says. I actually paid money for this, back before it was free. 7 years later, still playing it."
"very fun , love the hats and weapon skins . (im doing this review to get steam xp)"
This is amazing u should already own this game!
This game is pretty awesome.
♥♥♥♥
Team Fortress 2 is an amazing game. However I must warn anyone who's planning on buying Tf2 Its is very time-consuming. However it has a MASSIVE amount of different weapons which leads to many different playstyles. Team Fortress 2 is an amazing game with massive Replayability I highly reccomend.
"well i started playing and soon i did real games :/ not THAT good, later i just did other stuff on trade plaza, freak fortress 2 and then i couldnt find freak fortress 2.  in trade plaza there MUST be one sniper, they are so annoying,  i bet you will be spawn camped, look out for the pool for pyro sharks, there will be someone chating about trades, scouts are quite commom( and annoying), BE FRIENDLY TO FRIENDLYS, and expect no meds.  anyway the game is quite fun and about never went to com. stuff.  ps. if you play trade plaza (AUS) you will find a {MWA}  11/10 would get bodyshot by enemy snipers again"
10/10
Buy hat - Make bad trade - Lose hat - cry 
"  First Review!    So, I thought long and hard about how to about this review. Whether I would go about this jokingly or seriously. But, seeing a lack of reviews from people that joined after the F2P update that are serious, i though, meh, lets go serious.  TF2 ISN'T your average shooter. Or at least, your average F2P shooter. You don't need to pay money to get anywhere in the game, as there is no defined way to become better than other players other than practice. There's no 'Pay to Win' elements in the game, none at all.  Even TF2's gamemodes are different from your normal shooters, F2P or not. Nowhere else can you find a gamemode where you're pushing an explosive cart all the way accross the map, just to drop it in a hold and explode everything...usually including yourself. You also won't be able to fight some big shirtless austrailian man who kills people with his bare fists. Nope, none of that's gonna be in your Call of Duty Games.  The community is different as well. On your average day, you'll meet the people who are your regular gamers; the people who casually play TF2 in spare time or with friends. Then you'll meet the tryhards, though don't worry, the tryhards aren't too bad in this game. And of course, there's the trolls, but what's the fun of playing a game online if there isn't at least one troll lurking around.  In the end, I recommend this game to the casual gamers who will only get to play this in their spare time, and I also recommend this to the hardcore gamers, as there is always something to do on here, and there will always be a bomb to deploy/prevent deployment.  And yes, while hats are unfortunately used to judge a players skill, you can still topscore/do your best on a team while wearing no hats at all. Don't worry, it's totally possible."
best game I ever played 
Every since new update my thing syas any server 'this server is running a newer version of the game' How do i get it to update..
its good too
"Only played a little, but it was fun."
Team Fortress 2 is the best fashion simulator I have ever played.
"I'm ♥♥♥♥ing ashamed of how long i have been playing this game, and i have gotten too good for my own liking. So i decided to go and try play the game competitively with other people who like me have no lives, because public server aren't doing it for me anymore. As soon as i arrive in the lobby on this third-party website, this... creature with 10,000 hours in the game ridicules me and tells me to ♥♥♥♥ off for not having at least 2000 hours.  Perfect community/10  also good f2p system a game that at core is more fun than giving Brandy Talore a breast massage unique graphical style legendary ♥♥♥♥ing music blah blah etc. etc."
This is one of the most favorite games of all my friends and me because of the graphics and the concept in general. Hands down BEST Free 2 Play FPS Game ever! :) I recomend this game to everyone.
so good!   cant stop with the hats!!! 10/10 valve.  
"Best FPS F2P game on Steam. The Community of this game will never die and it's always growing. The Gameplay it's fun and easy to learn. Animation and graphics are cartoonish and friendly, AND IT'S FREE 2 PLAY! Trading, random weapon drops (and that makes the game not a Pay 2 Win), maps, game modes and a fantastic community! People creates weapons, maps, cosmetics, brand-new game modes for this game! That means alot and this game it's still from freakin' 2007 and still alive with big updates. Cosmetics help you to make your characters look different from others, a simple hat makes your class look funny, weird, cool or crazy. Same with taunts. I recommend this game. Like any other Multiplayer game, it's still, not perfect! And that makes this game so special. Players find exploits or game errors/bugs and they report them to Valve so they can fix them.  RATE: 9.5.10"
Lots of fun
"Well after 7 years in development and a butt load of play time my review will hopefull be worth the wait! What can i say about this game... well its just an exprence you will have to find yourself and even though there are only a select amount of classes the game just makes so mutch use of the loadouts that each class changes enough to make them feel fresh and uniquic. music is great, and hats make it great to spot spys :P. BUT the most important thing about tf2, what i find great is the community because evreone just wants to enjoy the game and have fun, everone is supportive of what you contribute and give feedback of what need you need to do to improve! Very worth a pick up!"
The Greatest FTP FPS ever concieved
This is Excelent game
This game is very alot of fun! You should try this game!
"For a free to play game, this is one of the better ones. It definetly can get annoying if you get auto balanced a lot but it is well worth it to get this game."
"Team Fortress 2 (In case you didn't know) is a class-based first person shooter created by Valve (also owner of Steam). There and nine classes in Team Fortress 2 which are: Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy all of which have very humorous personalities, often times very stereotypical. Each class has it's own play-style and a variation of different weapons. It includes about seven different multiplayer modes and it's own game mode called Man vs Machine or MvM for short, in which you fight off against waves of robots trying to protect Mann Co. In a summary, this is a very addicting FPS that I would definitely recommend to anybody who has some spare time, and feels like shooting some dudes up!"
"Team fortress 2 is one of my favorite games and I can tell that I will love it very much for a long long time as long as the updates keep coming, the only thing I can think of that I don't like is the trading. I give this game a 9.9/10"
This is the best FPS game you can get on the PC!! This is my favorite!!
I love this game 
"This is one of the best First Person Shooters I have ever seen in my entire 7 years of gaming, it's fun, customizable, and has 9 unique classes that can easily tell any other games' classes to eat out of the dumpster. The gameplay is suitable for 90% of the people who even pick up a game, it is truly amazing, and I can't wait to get the next few updates."
in shortly it's a best online game in the world!
Very nice game indeed! The halloween special is and was fun.All other holidays are fun too! So hurry and get TF2!
"This game is all about hats and cats, jk its a very fun game, if u dont have something to do. Go pick it up! ;)"
"This game is actually really good. For me this was my second game in steam 2.5 years ago, and i loved it! But yeah i recommend this alot and also you don't have to be good at the game if you want to have fun! Peace out people!    -A$$hole Engineer"
"Kill people while wearing the most garish and ugly hats, now for free."
• A D D I C T W A R N I N G ! •  Do Not Play This Game Or You Will Lose Your Life.
I LOVE This game :3
get the game because it's free end up spending more money than ever on cosmetics  10/10
"Good I guess, haven't played much."
Quite gud. Played once a while
"Very good game and no hackers. Well this game is not like CSGO, you don't have to remember a lot of stuff but I'm gonna tell you 1 thing you are gonna get over this game very fast. After playing it for like 1 month you will want to add money so you can become premium. After becoming P2P and not F2P your succesfully a 'Pro' in the game. Well now back to the thing I was saying. You will get over the game soon enough. Well for me it took me probably 6 months to get over the game. Well atleast you make a big profit out of it, after trading a lot you will make a ton of profit. I got like 60 euro out of the game. I know its not much but its still money. If you want to give it a try its free, you will rarely see hackers and you will make money :). Also you will make more trades than hours of gameplay. Seriously I've played the game for like _+1.000 hours and I've made +2000 trades :/. Go download it NOW and PLAY its  FREE 2 PLAY  I give this game a 9/10"
Very nice free game
"I just did this for an achievement. Oh, the review? Just look above or below me."
  This game is the best. Always hated it til I actually tried it and it's friggin great. Mvm is awesome I don't give a damn that u gotta pay for it. Doesn't matter how cold you are you'll still get a laugh out of this great game 
"This game is a must have if you like to blast the crap out of people, or follow the art of faceshooting. Plus there is a huge amount of unlockables and achievments as well as many updates that could come in the future.  Edit: this was a review back at the start at 2011 and now its 2016, this is when the game wasn't short of gaming perfection. Sure the random crits and face-stabs were annoying but we got along. ok now how the game is today... its a broken mess. I still love this game with all my heart, and to quote a viewer 'it will always have its charm', but I can honestly say that TF2 is hitting the final days of its life. I have had a ton of fond memories of this game and still have a few from time to time, but I just think Valve dug themselves way to far into the ♥♥♥♥ bottom (Trailor Park Boy ♥♥♥♥ Anlogy Intended), and to be honest, I don't see themselves every pulling themselves out of it. Let's us keep in mind that the game is almost 10 years old, it had a great run, but I think valve should just wrap up the updates and continue patching the small bugs and then move on to other projects, this game can't last forever. I really really REALLY don't want to bring Overwatch into this review, but everytime I play that and switch over to TF2, I am reminded on how buggy and god damn frusturating this game has become. I could go on about specifics, but this is a review for TF2 and I could be here forever just talking about it. I will always continue to play tf2 (unless TF3 is ever released of cource) and I still recommend people play it and give it a try since it has been a game I have enjoyed since it's release and has been a g, but I think its time to move on Valve, thanks for the memories, but I can't stand around ignoring this mess any longer. I always will continue playing it though, since it still is a fun game to play, but get ready to wait in lobbies and play hangman waiting to join a game, if that's not your cup of tea, you could play pubs on like the 37 non-valve ones that still excist (RIP Custom Content Players :( ).  Im not using this as an advertisment, but I do stream both Overwatch and TF2 where we will always be discussing both games in relation to each other, so If you want to clarify or correct me on some of the things I wrote, feel free to check us out (Twitch link in my profile) and tell us your thoughts or even your fond memories playing the game :). Im almost getting emotional talking about my memories about this game (MAN-TEARS OH BOY!) I want to see it succeed forever, but we got to be realistic, the clock is ticking and the heart of TF2 is slowly pumping away, VALVE PLEASE LISTEN TO THE FANS, WE WANT TF2 BACK :;("
"This game is perfect and instead of saying what i like about this game i decided to look at the negative comments to say that they are wrong, its not like you have anything to loose anyway now that it is free, lots of friendly players and lots of new things to do and get."
"I Like TF2, I Love This Game!, This Games Is Awesome!"
this game is amazing. epic cartoonish graphics stunning gameplay and of course: EXPLOSIONS 
"Its trash now, its repetitive"
10/10 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
They killed a perfect game with the last patch
"I used to love this game.  I bought the game back before it was f2p.  I thought f2p killed the game. I was wrong.  The latest update totally destroyed everything I loved about this game. It is no longer a fun casual experience. The 'Meet your Match' update killed this game. There are no more Valve servers. There are only community servers which are mostly trade servers. Oh, and matchmaking, but it's pure garbage.  I feel like a part of my youth has died. This is the grown-up world of matchmaking, competitive TF2. It's not the fun casual experience I used to know and love."
"From time to time this game has been my FAVORITE in steam *cough*2000+hours*cough* seriously. This game is a beautiful game where you have 1.A team and 2.A fortress to attack/defend Also its allways fun to look at those 'confused new players'. Overall this game may be a liiiiiitle bit worse than it was before *cough*'Casual'*cough*10Dollarticket*cough* But hey, its free! When has installing a free game ever hurt someone? I recommend it, but Gaben, please dont make me change my opinion."
This game broke me. 10/10
"Do you hate babies and puppies? If not, You Must try TF2! It has nine unique classes, each with thier own weapons, strengths, weaknesses, hats, and social backgrounds! With millions of players worldwide, you never have to be alone again! And of course, if you don't like it, you can go back to playing Farmville."
Great game. Highly recommend it to people who like cartoon-like graphics while fighting as a team.
This game is awesome! Chek this out!
Sooo worth the download. Especially now that it's free. Hours and hours of fun and tons of unlockables. What are you waiting for?! Go get it now!
tbh this game was better 2 years ago :/  thanks for the great memories. rip tf2
a very cool game with emotion and good player i recomend and the best is that it´s free to play :balloon:
"I used to play this game alot back in the days, but i got sick of it, got sick of the people who always want the best hats and ♥♥♥♥, even when they have the best hats, they really suck at the game, i remember a time when me and my friends were playing this game everyday, we didnt even have hats then, and there were people with unusuals, we literally wrecked them, anyway i gave up on this game, but now im back just for the gameplay, not the trading and all that, i just want to enjoy the game, even doe VALVe made it ridiculous with the new taunts and all that, but still i just want to play it."
really good game should download
love this game thats all you need to know 
turning the game into csgo wont save u
"Ladies and Gents, we present to you- Team Fortress:Global Offense  Rip Tf2"
I don't dress myself so I dress videogame characters.
"Enjoyable hours of fun with many people, will definately be skyrocketing in hours once the competitive matchmaking comes out."
It's a hat simulating game with a fun little 'gun shooting' game.
need.....more....hats....
You should play it... It's free... go on....
"There are hats worth more than you've made in your entire life, GG"
"Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is a diverse, fun experience. The different classes give you a choice when you're looking for something different. It's free to play, but not pay to win. In fact, the microtransactions stay out of your way unless you want to pay. The game drops items for you to customize the different classes with. The developers don't take this seriously, but that's a good thing; it provides for an interesting experience that is different almost every time."
Great game.
So many binds  69/10 would bind again.
"Great game in short, I love this game because of it's dialog and humor. Team Fortress 2 would never be the same with out it. Some of the other endless great things about TF2: *Range of items (always more coming) *Active Community (Steam workshop) *HATS! DURRR *Balanced classes *Great holiday events There are many more things that make TF2 Awesome and my favorite game of all time but that would spoil the experience!"
"New fastest building made in China, 30 story building built in 15 days or 360 hours. I have built a Sentry gun though. giant nipple/10"
"If you enjoy acquiring hearing disfunctions due to the sound of 5 year old kids' amazing microphones, this game is definetely for you. On a more serious note: TF2 is good, fast-paced, and an enjoyable FPS game."
"TF2 took a spinoff of your average FPS. It includes humor, action, and a great stlye of gameplay. The ability to earn &amp; trade items makes the experience a whole lot better. And, it's free, so no harm done if you don't like it."
A great game that really uses the full capabilities of the Source game engine. 10/10.
One of the very few Free to Play games worth installing!  11/10
AWESOME PURE ADRENELINE Heart beating awesomeness
"One, if not the best game I ever played"
"Team Fortress is the first, and the best, hat-based war game ! Using a totally new hat system, it will force you to kill other people to steal their hats ! And, even if you finally get a hat, there's no better showroom than a battlefield !"
"I liked this game,Never had it... but i liked very much..."
"When someone calls you a 'filthy causul' for only 500 hours into this game, AND YOU DO NOT HAVE THAT MANY HOURS INTO ANY GAME EVER! ya...there is something to this game that gives it a longevity I have never seen. the class balance is too good, every class has it's place.  Play it! "
"10/10 - Best class based first person shooter, period."
"Best online shooter imo   The only big deal about TF2 is the hat/misc economy. Every update hats and useless customizing items are added into the game, even tough they can be dropped (while playing normally) the chances of something like this happening aren't big enough to cover the fact that this game has waaaaaaay more hats and miscellaneous items than weapons and most of them can only be obtained trough the tf2 economy which takes a long time. But, with less than 1$ you can upgrade to a premium acc - wich makes your drop rates better and increases your inventory slots. That said, being freemium or not won't interfere on anything related to the gameplay."
"Loved this before it became a money machine, back when you still had to pay for it. Alright now for a free game."
AMAZING GAME. SO ADDICTIVE SO GOOD SO AMAZING IT IS AMAZING. ITS FREE GET IT
Hat Simulator 2012 is a great game suitable for all ages 10 and up.
"It's not Goat Simulator, but it's pretty good I guess."
Great
"I recommend this game to anyone. The probem people have with TF2 is that they expect it to be easy. It takes days to get used to and weeks to get the hang of it. It takes a long time to get used to this game; especially the style. It's probably one of the best games you can play on Steam, and for free. The item system is also a good aspect. It gives you a chance to make your own unique TF2 character and skill sets. The downside to this is that it causes players to forget how to play the game and focus on hats. However with all the bad things aside, this game truely is, probably, the most fun you can have online. I'd give it a 9.7 / 10."
im here for a section of a badge :D
best hat simulator of the decade
If you ask me whats my status about me when im playing this game with my total play time  Q: wow you have a lot of play time O_O how about your school  A: Ded   Q:how about your dream?

A: 1. i got scammed alot of time  2. 30% people i trade use some trading Exploit  3. lots of Newbie asking free item nonstop
This is the best Hat Simulator I have ever played.
"This is an Awesome first person shooter game thats awesome to play with your friends, the different game modes make this game even more awesome and complete for all people"
"So... This isn't my first review, BUT, I guess I need to do it again, since the first one was on 40 hours of playing... SO, after a year I get to know 5 things about this game.  1. It's awesome the TONS of nice people, almost every friend I have is from TF2, I can make some mentions, like the best player in my list, is a nice guy with true heart, and soemone that helped me when I was about to kill myself due to a break up with... anyway, other guys, like a teacher from a rocket jump server, that now is one of my best friends, an asian guy... that... well is asian, and a german guy with a profile pic of a girl... xD, you can get to know, I've been playing in almost every kind of server, from a normal valve Control Points server, to a Death Run server hosted by nice admins. Also, you can get to some weird servers, that are full of bots, or idle people, but well, that's something that happens sometimes.  2. Hats...  3. The community is half good, and half bad, I mean you get to know nice players, and some funny servers to just have fun, and other servers to completely destroy the enemy team, but since mannconomy update, now there is another market for all the things you can have and get, BUT you need items to do it, like keys and ♥♥♥♥, and they have prices, and a lot of more things that I don't want to get into it... I mean, yeah I used the market, tf2outpost, and trade.tf, but I don't care about prices or those things, If I want a thing, I GET THE THING, no matters what is the price for it... So I just skip this part, but if you wanna get into it, you will need to use backpack.tf  4. Last thing, this game saved my life, with the friends I got from it, I must say thank you for it, if you have a history, just ♥♥♥♥ing add me and hang me with me for a while, maybe I can even be your new friend (?)  5. Hats."
I love this awesome game! ewerybody should try it!
best gme evr 10/10 would fap to fre hat yis totaly not pydd /low i bribe gaben with snicker bar k? happy birthday team fortress 2 lolololoolololol olol best grafik ever betta than cod
"There are 2 companies: the Reliable Excavative Demolition (RED) and the Builders League United (BLU) who are competing against each other. Both of the company owners (Blutarch of BLU and Redmond for RED) hired mercenaries to put an end to one another. This is where TF2 multiplayer takes place….   In the multiplayer there are 2 teams (RED and BLU) and you can choose between 9 characters. These characters include the: Scout, Demo man, Pyro, Sniper, Medic, Spy, Heavy, Engineer, and Soldier. Each class has their own weapons and abilities (such as the Medic can heal people, the Spy can disguise as other players, the Scout can move twice as fast than others, etc.). The gameplay is SO much fun!   Overall, Team Fortress goes beyond great gameplay; it has one of the most fun/best First Person Shooter multiplayer out there. There is just the multiplayer, no campaign mode. But, the multiplayer is enough and Team Fortress 2 still outstands many of the video games out there. Also, IT’S FREE.  Ok, it’s sort of free... You still can to buy items from the in-game store (which is relatively cheap). So, if you like FPS, this is your game.   "
i Love This Game!
"Look at your Game Library. Now look at this. Now look back at your game library. Now back to me. Sadly, your Game Library doesn't have this. But if you stop being lazy and download this you could have it. Look down. Back up. Where are you? You're on this store page. Right next to the download button. What's in your head? Back at me. Its this. Its a simple download button. Look again. The button is now a hat. Anything is possible when you download this game. I'm on a horse."
Really fun game. I spent a lot of my time playing this. It's also a good way to get other steam games cheaper or free
Once you start playing this game you lose ur ability to play call of duty -_-
Ever wish you could have that very expensive hat you saw at that one store? Well fear no more! This is the world's most loved and realistic hat simulator on Earth (It even has the people who insult you over your hat!)! It even comes with the wars that come with your hats! 11/10 would go bankrupt over virtual hats again.
"One worthy thing to mention, one thing this game is full of, is hats. If you don't have hats, you are an outcast until you either find one or steal your parents credit card to buy some. This game in my opinion has a lot of key features that make it great. First off, there is no campaign, so its all multiplayer based. The community is very friendly towards anyone. A mostly silly game, but if you want to play competitive, they have servers for that. This game is also a good way to make money, you can sell keys on the market, or do what i did and play MvM and pray that you get an australium. Valve seems to listen to what the community wants added in to the game and will add them (for the most part). Each weapon is unique and balance. They will have something good about them but then they will have something to counter that (Ex: A weapon might have +25% damage but then will also have -25% movement speed). Overall this game is great and despite being free, is one of the best games I have ever played in my life. Im sure there are others who will agree with me.  (P.S: DON'T buy anything from the Mann.Co store, no matter how desperate you are)."
"Endless Fun for everyone, kept me from being bored so many times. I highly suggest this game."
Thanks Valve for making this great game! The frequent updates don't take hours and they are big! A whole selection of weapons and 9 classes make each one useful for any situation AND I just love the hats! What I really would love is that when a Free to Play first comes ( I'm not saying I'm free to play check my backpack ) they should get a reward hat. But anyways thanks for this game and I hope it gets better!
It's Team Fortress 2. You can't go wrong.
I have way too many hours spent in this time trap. Be warned that you WILL be addicted to this amazingness.
Don't have hats? Dont have a life! PLAY THIS GAME!!!
amazing game if you like cartoonish gooofy fps then this is the game for you
This game is free but it is still really fun! The servers are addictive and to top it all off the custome maps were even fun!! I recomend getting this.

"Well what can I say, THE epitome of free games is this one, there really isn't a pay-to-win scenario, as you can randomly get items you normally have to pay for by just playing the game, and who can forget idling back in the day? You can run this game on nearly any computer due to its low SysReqs. I remember having my first Steam account 5 years ago, which is long gone due to forgetting my password. And having only one game, it was this one. I had never played anything like this at the time, as I was mainly a console game at that point. Another positive of this game is the community is great, there isn't really any modders on it, unlike the Xbox version which is nearly unplayable right now. Also, beware of the Spies, probably a majority of my deaths on this game are from Pyros and Spies, those little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. There is also a myriad of maps out there made by community members, some of them like Harvest, are one of the maps you'll probably play the most. Also if you own Garry's mod, you get TF2 maps, character models, and assets from the game to use in Garry's mod. The classes are well balanced and it has a lot of replay value, as illustrated by some other reviewers with 700+ hours on the game. And now onto the cons Some people mic spam, it is rare but it happens and sometimes you get into competitive games and you get cursed out by some 36 year old man who is taking everything way too seriously. Or you get some one with a horrible connection who makes the game nearly unplayable. That is about it for cons, and for the review also. 9.5/10 is my final verdict What are you waiting for?! Download this game NOW!"
So addicting 
It's like COD but with guns!
wtf i was playing and some guy stabbed me with a knife and killed me
its a really good game and almost never gets boring
Too addicting !
Awesome hat simulator. Lots of fun...until you lag out.
10310 hours = 429 days. still fun.  significantly less fun since valve decided to copy overwatch
It isn't too late. Just keep telling yourself that.
One of the few games in which good players get paid.
  -75% in Christmas sale.
"If I was to summarise this game, I would simply describe it as the best first person shooter ever made. If you don't have it downloaded then hop right over to the steam library and go to the free games section.  However, if you're the type that likes a bit more detail in your descriptions, then team fortress is also the right game for you. It is truly a 'easy to learn, hard to master' type of game. Additionally, upon starting the game you will not be instantly swamped by players who can kill you easier because they have weapons that are better than you. Everything in tf2 is balanced beautifully, between the weapons, individual classes and the overall team dynamic. Each new item doesn't bring with it a new advantage, but a new way that you can tweak your playstyle, with it's own individual positive and negative aspects.  The overall feel of the game is great as well, due to the cartoony graphics and humorous quips that your team will constantly spout. Even in the worst matches, when I've had my head driven into the dirt by a more skilled team, I still walk away with an inward grin at that one time that four of my team mates and I walked a literal conga line through the enemy team's defence or airblasting an enemy scout and keeping him pinned against a wall while he shouted that I was a spy, followed by us sharing a high five and his character spontaneously exploding.  I could go on about this game for days, but you shouldn't be reading it. You should be playing it as I speak."
.
I think this is the best game valve has made.
Is a game with goons that goo pew pew
"Fun game, 10/10 especially as it's now free :)"
Get it. That's all that can be said. No words can truely describe it's awesomeness.
"Ruined my life, thanks Valve."
"TF2 is pretty fun once you get know how the systems work from trading to battling, collecting hats and cosmetics is pretty fun and the game has endless variety of gamemodes."
Super Game 420/420 weed. Would wasted all my money on this when i would have money to waste. Mabye i rob a bank next time to waste all money on this
"This game is really easy to get into, but if your a regular cod player this isnt a game for you, in adition the ''free to play'' element is broken when you have to buy a key to open a box that has a 1% chance of giving you a hat that has either our planets orbiting it OR its on fire.  10/10 in adition my wallet feals violated."
It's a good game if you have money
Hat Simulator. Hahahahahah. I'm so funny. Can I have an Oscar please?
Everyone who uses steam should own this game!
"'It all started a couple days ago when i was in the shower. I had not scrubbed my ♥♥♥ for a long time and we had no bodywash in the shower, so i looked under my sink and that was the first time i saw it. My love, right guard with mentol cooling was all the way in the back. Having never tried it and feeling a little adventurous i took it and started to scrub down. I got to my ♥♥♥ and everything was fine at first, the stuff felt pretty good and it instantly covered up the stank. It wasnt until 30 seconds after i was done and my ♥♥♥ began to burn something went incredibly right. I was in pain at first, trying to bend over and wash my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out with water. Then something i didnt expect happened, i got a hard on. I began to realize i liked the burning sensation. Something in my head then screamed out to me 'put ya finger in ya butt' these kinds of thoughts had never occured to me before, and i have never felt homosexual in my life, but the the stinging was too much. I did it, to my dismay and joy i liked it, 'huaoh yeah' i said aloud as i rubbed more right guard all over my backside. I realized i sounded exactly like peggy hill when i said that and started laughing, and then it happend, i jazzed. I now buy right guard body wash with menthol whenever im at the store. I take it with me along with my lube when i bait and give myself a good scrub down. Everytime im in the shower whether or not i want it or not the right guard drags me into something sexual. My right guard body wash with menthol sleeps right next to me on the pillow next to my face, and now i couldnt live without it.'"
Great game to just kill time and relieve boredom
fun cheap addictive
Amazingly fun game. Tons of different stuff to do.
Best Free To Play Game out there!
"The goal of this game is to have as many hats, as possible - that's why I disagree with opinions like 'This game is F2P, but not Pay to win.' Anyway, that's the best(because the only?) hat simulator I've ever played. 10/10 Would spend another 1.2k hours on it."
"Originally I got the game to enjoy the Team Working FPS. Then i noticed that Once you have a Hat everything changes. From a FPS/Strategy game to a Hat Simulator I have been hooked on hats for the past 300 hours on here. It ruined my life, all I dream now is hats, hats, more hats. I can't even play competively w/o looking like a drag queen of hats  11/10 Would Recommend"
this might be the best FPS ever made by valve! 
great game
Needs more hats.
"This is, by far my favorite game, the run &amp; gun action genre is exiting to watch and thrilling to play."
Funnest game ever. You will not regret downloading! Well...Maybe the trolls will make you regret it.... But thats only if you select a server that has one in at the time!   Definetly a MUST PLAY from me.
A fun game with enough depth of a competitive game. Definitely worth playing.
"This was the best game i ever played  Good Points:  -It´s fun   -it´s Free   -Yow don´t need an awsome pc to play it   -Good fan base Bad Points:   -Some peopole will laugh at you because you´re a F2P   -Needs more weapon,hat... updates"
I beleive Team Fortress 2 is a great massively multiplayer online first-person shooting game.
"One of the first games i fell in love with. I have played this game for years know but i think it is finally time to do a review. I will talk about the Pros and Cons and why i fell in love with this game.  -Pros- 'AMAZING GAME IN GENERAL' 'It is quite old now but that makes it so that some people are GODS at this game and that makes it so you always have it a little challenging' 'There is so much content in this game that it is insane. Even though you dont like this game you could still do trading and making communities for your friends' 'You dont have to spend ANY MONEY on this game what so ever. If you want to play fully free you can do that. They never ask you for money or so' 'Amazing game you can play with friends' 'If you want new stuff you can just trade your stuff for other stuff'  -Cons- 'The game is starting to become a little old and i am afraid that this game may die in some years' 'It is quite addictive so play with cautioness' 'If you want to trade it can take a while'   Why i fell in love in this game is probably because my friends did aswell. I have so much memorys with friends in this game it is insane. I really love this game but i hope that if this game dies in the future they will make a second game. But i am not so sure on that. They will probably want everyone to start playing CS:GO instead. But anyways, I hope this will help you and i hope you will have a good day!"
Very fun game that can give you hours upon hours of fun! Highly recommend!
"One of the best FPS games of all time - with smooth mechanics, amazing game play, and querky hats. For anyone who likes shooting people... in style."
Best hat themed conga simulator of all time.

"This is one of my favourite games. I have been on steam for under a year and started off with unturned then just heavily got into this game. The trading community is great, everybody is always up for a trade. 1 thing i would like GabeN to add is another class. Gimme ideas in le comment section."

A very addicting game made by the awesome valve!
"I must say, after playing for a few days, switching to console and coming back, TF2 has still been great everywhere I play it."
4/20 - Would f*ck again - ign
Plot of game:  HAT HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS  10/10 Better FPS then COD
Ruined 2 years of my life until it ruined itself.
Dear Valve   We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
"Best Game and really addicting lots of things to experience! Pros: - Exploit and Glitches - Crazy Nerfs and buffs - Lag and Crashes (kinda stops now but you know it won't stop) - Fun gamemodes - Tons of things to Get, Play and Meet - The conga is gonna evolve - Gameplay  Inbetween: - SpawnCampers and Friendly Killers - Weapon reskins - Bonus Ducks - Contracts  Cons: - Time   Would Get shot in the head with the machina while getting burned alive by a phlog alive  10/10 :)"
"Tf2 is a fun, fast paced first person shooter that i reccomend to anyone with a good sense of humour"
"The best Free to Play game on steam! Very cool graphics, and it's very addictive! Just download it now!"
Every other day someone adds me and wants my ♥♥♥♥. 10/10  Update: I have sold all of my valuable hats for money. Which is good I guess.
Amazing Game! I love all of the weapons and taunts you can collect!
"Great game 2   Communication Payment confirmed within 2 days, sent one test message and it was replied to in 25 hours. Not bad.  Shipping Ordered on the 24th, received today October 4th. Very impressed. Came in two layers, good enough stealth.  QUALITY The important part.  I'll start with the good:  Hologram looks great Feels good No information errors Colors and template look good Scans correctly There is a spy-crab on the game   The bad:  hologram overlay is off, look at the Date and 1969 at the bottom fonts look just a bit fuzzy generic, easy-to-spot signature font (especially since the game focuses on the signature part) photoshop is not the best No UV? No mp line  When considering all the quality factors, I would give this game a 7.5/10. However, considering it only cost $10.. It's a great game. Overall I was impressed with the service and speed, and think this game is worth much more than $10. Maybe $50. I'm joking but seriously, this game would pass easily at grocery stores and CVS. If I didn't already have like 30 fakes, this would have been an amazing buy."
Hats:  Highly Addictive TF2 Stuff
"I was only 10 years old.  I loved TF2 so much, I had almost all the weapons I wanted.  I would leave my computer on for hours, Just to get a few drops.  Then I got my first hat, The gibus.  Suddenly everything changed.  I no longer cared about playing for fun, I only cared about the 'hats'  I 'borrowed' my mommys credit card and bought more hats.  I had so many hats, I loved them all.  But then someone traded me, I accepted.  They offered an Unusual for all my hats.  It was so sexy looking, I put up all my hats and traded.  But no Unusual, He scammed me.  I lost it all.  I was so sad I cried for hours.  Later that night I prayed to Gaben for my hats back.  I went to bed after praying.  I felt warm.  I looked behind me, It was Gaben!  He said 'This is Gabe Newell' and handed me a Burning Team Captain.  Then I woke up, I was wearing my Burning Team Captain and I was naked.  I saw Gabe leave through the window, he looked back at me and winked.  Hats are love. Hats are life"
This the most fun game you can ever play all of you COD players who think this game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game then get the hell out.Anyway this game is not like COD that you have too really win you can play just for fun and have lot's of fun and it's my most fav game ever so go and DOWNLOAD IT NOW !!!!!!
"Over 1800 hours played.  Tons of money wasted.  Still playing it, because it is fun."
"I've put a fair number of hours into this game, and my review won't add anything that hasn't already been said.  Take it like this: Multiplayer game from 2007 that still has one of the greatest player bases to this day.  Yeah, it's that good."
Awesome Game! Very Adicting!
Fun game. especially when playing with friends. this game allow friends to work together and create better bonds - really a teamwork game.
This game is perfect for crits and giggles. Better with friends!
"Best game you can sit around in a chair &amp; drink beer, and get fat."
"So this one time, I'm touchin' this dong and I think to myself 'christ this is pretty gay' and I look down and it turns out it's my own. What a relief.  Game got a billion slavs adding me on Steam for dumb trades. 0/10."
Team Fortress Two is a game where you fight to achieve goals. Like dropping the Payload or capturing the intelligence. In the process of doing that you can find items from crates to hats and misc. Those items can be sold for other items in other games witch is very useful.
its a vereey good game
"This game it's just the best I ever played (my opinion). With the trading system, the community market gets realy exiting when u get to grow up ur fortune. The gameplay itself can not be described untill u play the game, try it if u don't play already, go ahead and play 3 hrs. U'll get addicted."
you play or i beat you
it is a really good game i recommend this game to my friends and they like it too.i will give this game 9/10 great game.it has alot of intersting game modes.if you are fps gamer u should try it
love this game. played a server with mods that allowed me to buy upgrades for everything and was able to shoot 100 rockets a second. 10/10
I Honestly Think this game Team Fortress 2 is The best Game Ever in My Opinion .
"Awesome game, and also free to play! Its very fun to play with friends, but also to play alone, you can even dance &amp; play Rock, Paper, Scissors! Its just pretty cool ^.^ It totally dosnt look like Cod, no map, s.a.s, no spetznas and keep on going. Just one word: Awesome."
"All classes op, must nerf."
"Team Fortress Two, the name itself is well known enough to sell the game. TF2 has existed since for over 6 years now and has still outlived most shooters. Unlike the other team fortress games/mod it is much more quirky than serious. However do not let its good nature fool you, it is still a very competitive game with communities ranging from trading based to competition. Even though it is very serious sometimes, it is also very easily to find a game focused just on having fun, which is rather difficult in most games now. TF2's community is mostly responsible for the current content in the game. Maps, weapons, and character cosmetics are mostly created by the community and added in Valve's official updates. The community is even responsible for creating a currency system using the crafting materials and a few notable cosmetics. Even though the game has existed for many years, there is so much balance amongst the nine classes and their various weaponry that new players and beta testers alike can be engaged in a battle with no clear outcome until the final seconds. In short, there is no reason to not try TF2. There is a class for any playstyle and its a free game that i so fun, I don't think anyone would mind paying for."
Why you should get tf2:  I told you to.
"No matter who you are or what you do, you end up identifying with one of the 9 classes. For me, its the Heavy!  CRY SOME MORE!!"
I found a hat yesterday.
"Good game, not the best "
"After so long, I decided to make a review.   Half a decade almost, barely started playing when the game wasn't F2P, and a lot has changed since then. Cosmetics are the biggest change, pretty much creating a whole market for them. But all in all, TF2 is still the same, it's still fun to play, challenging at times, and the game play keeps you on edge even after all these years."
Amazing game! recommended for everyone
Best hat simulater ever
The most fun I've ever had in a multiplayer game. 10/10 would recommend.
This is by far the best f2p game on the market.
"TF2, it's FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! (ROBLOX - It's Free reference)"
The Best Game Ever in all Steam
"Incredible gameplay and a wide range of classes to choose from, this game offers a unique and very enjoyablHATS HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS HATS"
10/10 very good multiplayer and a must have for Valve lovers!
"This game is really fun to play. Theres 2 sets of teams - Blue, and Red. Then you choose you're classes: Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, Spy. And once you're in game you just have fun. Hope this review was helpful!"
"TF2, the game with the most evolved but screwed up econemy ever :D You can't imagine how rich you can get in this game :-)  Its fun to play, trade and profit with lel  i rate it a 9/10"
A great and also a funny game. The diversity of items and maps is unbelievable. I recomend!
"100/100 Perfect For Any One Who Likes Shooting,getting new  items,FPS/TPS  In My Words I Love This Game"
Love this game! 10/10
"It's a really great game for competitive and casual gamers alike. So much content you'll never get bored, and with player made maps and community servers, there's so much to do, like Jail, Rocket Jump maps, and much more!"
This game has kept me entertained for countless hours.
A great F2P shooter to put hours into. There are so many options that its hard to find your niche. Once you find the class/gametype/server that you love you will keep coming back.
"I bought this game with my own money and now i score some cash with weed this could be worse atleast im not kanye west im an undeground legend stabilished in '92 rolling with some real OG's not those phony EMCEES,anyway have fun playing this fake MC simulator if you are a real G go get some real karate lessons kid."
"This game is extremely addictive, it's not too gory, and hats are available as well as other clothing items for your characters. :D At first, I found Team Fortress 2 a hard game to play as switching weapons while keeping an eye on who's trying to kill me and who I'm trying to kill was a bit much for me because when I did start playing this game, I was a noob at video games all together (well, on the compter), but now that I've been playing it for a while, I've got the hang of it, and so will you if you haven't already. Team Fortress 2 is also a fantastic game to meet new people and make new friends, pretty much all of my friends on Steam apart from two or three I met on TF2. :3 Not all servers are shooting and killing servers, there are trading servers, Prop Hunt servers, Slender servers and more! There is also an offline mode if you just want to practise boosting your skills as each class. Don't worry about players joining the game as there are bots (computer controlled players) which automaticly spawn after you set the amount of how much you want! Bots don't reply to you unless they're a Medic. The only reply you get is a bit of a heal... no voice responds or anything... which can seem a bit weird seeing as you're not playing against real people. Other than that, this game is just amazing. And it's free! But it is a big download, that's probably the only down-side to it, but otherwise, as I said, Team Fortress 2 is a brilliant game and I do recommend it to anyone who likes first person shooter games which are not over the top with gore.  If you don't have it, get it... it's free! What's better than that? A good quality game which is free?  Anyway,  Thank you for reading this review and I do hope you enjoy TF2 if you have it. ~Pet"
"Awesome game, with an awesome community!"
Great game !
Well.. There's hats...
Those pc requirements are old i think steam needs to change it no offense
" https://gyazo.com/9404178d1c3d8b3206b8344bb8638da7   When you see the game costs $20 and gets hit by a 75% off and goes free, you know its the best."
The most fun online expirience ever - absolutely free!
Ruined my social life with my friends and family! Plus hats! 5/5
"One of the first pictorial depictions of a hat appears in a Thebes tomb painting which shows a man wearing a conical straw hat. Other early hats were the Pileus, a simple skull cap; the Phrygian cap, worn by freed slaves in Greece and Rome; and the Greek petasos, the first known hat with a brim. Women wore veils, kerchiefs, hoods, caps and wimples. St. Clement, the patron saint of felt hatmakers, is said to have discovered wool felt when he filled his sandals with flax fibers to protect his feet.[4] In the Middle Ages, hats were a marker of social status and used to single out certain groups. The 1215 Fourth Council of the Lateran required that all Jews identify themselves by wearing the Judenhat (“Jewish hat”), marking them as targets for anti-Semitism.[5]The hats were usually yellow, and were either pointed or square. [6] In the Middle Ages, hats for women ranged from simple scarves to elaborate hennin,[7] and denoted social status. Structured hats for women similar to those of male courtiers began to be worn in the late 16th century.[8] The term ‘milliner’ comes from the Italian city of Milan, where the best quality hats were made in the 18th century. Millinery was traditionally a woman’s occupation, with the milliner not only creating hats and bonnets but also choosing lace, trimmings and accessories to complete an outfit.[9]   Men's hat, 1600-1625 In the first half of the 19th century, women wore bonnets that gradually became larger, decorated with ribbons, flowers, feathers, and gauze trims. By the end of the century, many other styles were introduced, among them hats with wide brims and flat crowns, the flower pot and the toque. By the middle of the 1920s, when women began to cut their hair short, they chose hats that hugged the head like a helmet.[8] The tradition of wearing hats to horse racing events began at the Royal Ascot in Britain, which maintains a strict dress code. All guests in the Royal Enclosure must wear hats.[10] This tradition was adopted at other horse racing events, such as the Kentucky Derby in the United States.[11] Extravagant hats were popular in the 1980s, and in the early 21st century, flamboyant hats made a comeback, with a new wave of competitive young milliners designing creations that include turban caps, trompe-l'oeil-effect felt hats and tall headpieces made of human hair. Some new hat collections have been described as 'wearable sculpture.' Many pop stars, among them Lady Gaga, have commissioned hats as publicity stunts.[12]"
"Another great game by Valve great multiplayer and single player if you don't have internet or don't want to play with other people host your own server there are guides on how to do so, great variety in classes and weapons, great personalitys for each class, overall a great f2p game one i would always play and never get bored of."
the game is awesome try it
Ruined my life.  10/10
hats  
"I wasted all my money on cosmetic Items, 10/10 would do again."
Best F2P of all time! With 9 different classes and a lot of weapons you`ll never get bored of this game!
I love this GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Super sexy game for awesome people.
Very fun F2P game for new people to steam. Great cartoonish alternative to CSGO
run around and shoot the other team
Great shooter with great team action. 9 great classes with awesome personalitys couldn't find a better game with a economy you can join if you please. Recommended for anyone 20/10 game
This game is very popular and i see why.I really enjoy this game and i love it's style.Also the classes are very balanced so i recommend this game.
One of my favorite games
*has one of the best soundtracks in gaming history*  *only uses it during main menu*   10/10
the best fps i ever played
The game that makes you smile from the sheer absurdity of the combat.
Having played CoD and Battlefield style military shooters I have been truly revitalised by how different TF2 plays. The well balanced nature of all the classes and all the unique weapons justs makes this the one of the most fun games out now.
What man in this world does not enjoy TF2...I certainly don't know of one. I would highley recommend this game!
"really like this game, love the events an the hats."
"Fun, fun, fun. Not super techincal. Lot's of cosmetic customizations for charachters. The game is constanly changing with new maps."
"Three or four years now of playing this game, and no matter my mood. I can ALWAYS play it. Never gets old. :)"
This is probably the reason why I got a D on my final
"Best game I may have ever played. Amazing and fun graphics make it even more great to play. No need to think about buying it, BECAUSE IT'S COMPLETELY FREE. You can play it for as long as you want and you don't need to pay a dime. I very much recommend this game!"
Highly Recommended for new PC gamers
"This is, in more ways than one, a video-game."
You no longer have a life...
"Awesome game for everyone to enjoy, isn't too reliant on having to buying items"
Tons of fun! This is a great game to find and play with friends
1. Play game 2. Realize it has hats 3. Pay Gaben for keys 4. Unbox 5. Get broke 6. Still play game cuz it's free  10/tf2
"Endless fun, with lots to do, collect and in general mess about on, TF2 has something for hardcore and casual gamers alike. It's even Free-to-play too! So don your favourite hat and get shooting!"
"TF2 is like no other fps! There is no real medium range, all-around-good weapon (like an assult rifle). The classes all have different stregnthes, weaknesses and all have thier own job to do. The name of the game is balence, and you rely on your teammates. I think TF2 is like a great equalizer of games. It's so unique that most of the things other games have taught you don't apply anymore. It's hard for everyone starting out, but don't give up, because you will improve fast.   The best thing: TF2 has heart (like most valve games). It's a psycotic heart, but a heart nonetheless. The cartoon-y graphics are endearing and all of the classes have really fun personalities. TF2 has something that CS:GO just can't capture.  Did I mention that it's FREE!!!!!!   Try it out, and have fun!"
"I've been Playing Team Fortress since the beginning of this summer 2013, to be honest I haven't played a game that can matche up to Team Fortress, and no matter how boring you are the Fun Never ends, it keeps going, going and going."
13 Year old put his mom on the mic and told me to ♥♥♥♥ off for scamming him and stealing her money 11/10
"Team Fortress 2 is an epic free first person shooter. Combining comedy and action together really well is what makes this game so fun to play. I recommend this to anyone who just wants to have fun, or play with their friends on a quality game."
Best hat simulator EVER!
"This game is epic, I HIGHLY recomend this if you're a cartoon-fantasy violence murder lover. All on all, it's a great game and you should get it, it's free to play and made by valve!"
The graphics are amazing!
"When I'm having a great day, but I accidentally see this game in any way/shape/form I become sad. Mainly because of the cancer I developed after playing this once"
"When Team Fortress 2 was released in 2007, it was the result of nine years of development. It's now seven years later, and development hasn't actually stopped. A wealth of gamemodes, weapons, and gameplay adjustments later, Team Fortress 2 is less intricately well-balanced, but is still as exciting and funny as it ever was. Going free-to-play was also a smart decision, I feel, as the expanded player-base means you'll never go without a match. Absolutely recommended."
"Hilarious FPS that has Valve written all over it  If you've played games by Valve before you know each of there games has an almost unexplanible comedic charm and TF2 is no different, the graphics aren't the best, but thats part of what makes the game funny and what makes it great...Another awesome Valve game!"
Hands down best hat simulator I've ever played.
i....i dont need to tell yu why you should get this game.
it's free and my most played game. enough said.
A brilliant online FPS fortress defense and attack game. With outstanding level design and creative made guns. Big on gore(Body parts explode when destroyed with explosives) But still a brilliant game. This NEEDS to be on XBOX LIVE and PLAYSTATION NETWORK
"Great game, clocked in 1000+ hours and still not bored. Working on creating maps for the community."
"Amazing free game. It's what got me on steam, and it's lots of fun! I enjoy it!"
"A really good game. One of my favorites. Has many players around the world and the trading system will get you hooked. Free and fun, Team Fortress 2 is one of the best games ever created and you should get this game."
"Team Fortress 2 is always hard to start off. I remember starting and dying constantly but still enjoying it. Eventually I got better and started learning other things like Rocket Jumping and Trading. With all the classes, weapons, maps and gamemodes I never get bored. And they keep bringing more out! There's also all the mods and community made gamemodes such as saxton hale or super smash bros. I would definitely reccomend this to anyone who has a PC. I play on a laptop and from time to time it can lag, but nowhere near as bad as some games and it's still playable.  Unlike other FPS games like Call of Duty, the classes in this are just hilarious. They have each of their own personalities and just say some funny stuff while your playing. With the fact that you can still kind of customize your character with all the hats and cosmetics they keep adding, and keep the actual character is great. There's also the Halloween - Scream Fortress (which I'm enjoying at the moment) and the christmas - Smissmas. This is by far my favourite game today and I don't intend to stop playing it anytime soon."
I've spent 233 hours of my life playing Team fortress 2 and there's only one thing i can say... LIFE WELL SPENT!!!
"1 Word to describe this game. AWESOME!!!! Its a great First person shooter game cos there are tons of cosmetics, hats and weapons up to get. BEst of all its free!"
It's the best free-to-play game that will satisfy a variety of tastes. Play this game and you will lose many hours from your life.
Its Mostly the same game i play all the time :3
This game is super awesome!!!!
"the only fps on the market that includes gourmet cooking. here's a recipe i've found that's one of my personal favorites, try it yourself some time:  you will need -a sandwich (store-bought is fine) -glass of milk -a jar of your own urine  take the sandwich, throw it on the ground, and smash the jars of milk and urine on it. I've made many friends with such a recipe in pubs be sure to share with all of yours"
"I pretty much stopped playing this game and moved on to some other stuff. However, it still holds a special place in my gaming heart. This is a free to play game DONE RIGHT. Even if you could consider something 'OP' there is always a way around it through skill and team work."
1 of thebest games i have ever played and it is free!!!! 
TF2. Amazing. Very. Amazing. No less. Plenty more.
THE GAME IS ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME!
I have spent over $600 on this game.
Really good! I love it! Trading is awesome and awesome maps and stuff!
♥♥♥♥ing scary advertising but a funny game
An amazing game with both fun and action
If you don't have this game then you have a serious problem and you may want to contact your doctor.
"I don't like the direction they are going with the game now (adding competitive mode and leveling up to try and compete with games like overwatch), but still one of my favorite pc games. The cosmetic trading/collecting can be frustrating and insanely expensive if you choose to do it that way, but the actual gameplay is great definitely one of the best free shooters you can find. Most of my time has been spent in community servers with custom game modes, but the official modes are pretty fun as well."
A fun and cartoony class based fps with a strong community still up and running from 2007.
"TF2 can trace it's lineage back to Quake, when we didn't have all this recharging health &amp; eye-bleeding when shot nonsense. Bunny-hopping, rocket-jumping, strafe-jumping- all benchmarks of the earliest days of the FPS, and TF2 has carried that torch- when no other retail game in the past 2 years or so has included those things, Valve's brave enough to swim against the current. Bottom line: It is THE best game released within the past 3 years that isn't one of the big two- CoD and Halo. Funny sound bites, cartoony visuals, all mannerisms of ways to customize, and classes to fit all sorts of players, whether you be a bum-rush ♥♥♥♥♥♥, or a stealthy ambusher. Play some more, and you'll fall in love with it."
"Free my ♥♥♥, I downloaded this game and 3 months later im spending money on hats. I now live out of a box sucking up mcdonalds wifi. 9/10 would recomend"
The best type of cancer
"I love it, its free to play, and theres just amazing stuff! Go check it out"
One of the best games i have ever played
It's AWESOME
"This is your life's blood. If you have not played it, I pity you deeply. Your life must be this pitch-black abyss with no light in sight, but wait! Through this abysmal existence, you see hope. This hope makes you feel good, it makes you feel right. You lift your head and look towards this perfect focal point to realize it is Team Fortress 2."
Its free and and its a realy good game which i have spent many hours with friends on
Good game. Had me playing for more than 1000 hours now
It is pretty good sometimes.
YOU LIKE VIDEO GAMES?  GOOD BECAUSE NEITHER DO I.

This game is great! Lots of good people &amp; traders.
One of the best games ever! And the best First person shooter in the World! This game is a must play!
"This game is just EVERYTHING you need, Why? Heres 5 reasons why. 1. Its Free 2. Community is great (mostly) 3. HATS HATS HATS 4.Funny 5.Great Trailer/Characters"
"Simply put, one of the best first-person shooters on the market. It's not for everyone, but if you like the genre, you'll probably love TF2."
Awesome game! Everyone should give this game a try.
Its Good.
Started playing it recently and it is amazing!!
"Once an F2P, feel ashamed Once a P2P, feel broke"
This game ruined my life. 10/10
"There was a time when I was not yet a Mann. I sat around the house in my underpants eating Cocoa Pebbles soaked in bourbon and watching international soap operas, and that was okay by me. My family, however, was filled with shame. 'How are you ever going to collect hats to feed your family, Sugar? You can't even grow a beard like mine! You are no member of this family, and you are certainly no man!' 'Cool it, gramma, my stories are on!' I would tell her, and then she would punch me in the groin and storm out. It happened five, often six times a day; gramma was in the throes of dementia. I could not deny that her beard was impressive, though, and she was never without a hat on her plate. That is when Team Fortress exploded into my life, leaving me a crippled husk of meat and shattered bones. That is not a metaphor. I was in physical therapy for years before I finally gained the use of my legs again, but I would argue it bettered my life. Overnight, a beard sprouted from my chin, and then my beard even grew a beard of its own. I changed my regular breakfast of bourbon-soaked cereal to a bowl of live rounds and replaced one of my broken legs with an assault rifle. Hats and dismembered body parts rained from the sky on a daily basis, and life was finally going my way. I owe my success--and my insatiable bloodlust--to Team Fortress 2."
Killed someone with a peice of ham 10/10
I have had over 600 hours of tf2 and I am still loving it!
Not meant for people who only play Call of Duty. You will die within seconds and will continue to do so.
I say its a fun game for begginers fps computer games you can find new items and eqiop them.
"Made me addicted to cards, hats and bread."
The hell with rules i play for fun and to rage so ♥♥♥♥ the rules i will never mod or anything like that
"I love tf2 and its a great game. Whether you play with friends, or by yourself, its fun to play. The kinds of things that you can do in it are immense and there is no end to the fun you can have while playing. And the best part... you dont have to pay to get the game."

Great Game!!!!
The storyline is ok
Nice game :-)
"Team Fortress 2 is 1 of my all time favourite games. It's free-to-play and it's not to daunting to free-to-players. The music is great and the maps are classic. My favourite part is that the 9 classes all have so much depth and personality. They each come together from all parts in the world and have a great time killing people for money. Also there are loads of weapons and funny hats that you can show off to your friends (Unless you are a lonely gamer with no friends). Overall, I rate TF2 a 5 star game with so many maps, funny back stories and great, entertaining game play. I think everyone should try it out."
Very awesome game and nice graphic
"Team Fortress 2 is such a classic. At only 7 years after release date, it is still SO much fun and intense battles still remain intense especially on a server with better players. Kudos to the devs on this title, it really is one of my favorite first person shooters and will be for a long time to come.... +1!"
This game is awesome :) i definitly recommend it!
"The red vs. blue factor seems like a playful thing in this game, alot of the time red, and blue are depicted as teaming up quite a bit. That's what makes this game diffrent, and i love it."
Awesome and timeless. You never get bored of it!
"Team Fortress 2 is a facinating fps that I would definitly recomend to practically anyone. There are things you can do from trading to styling your favorite class with hats, miscs etc. This game is an amazing game but even better, its free. Although this game can be tough I dont see why you shouldnt get it. Like I said I enjoy this game and recomend it to anyone that is intrested in getting it."
"Man this is getting boring, Hey a new item! This isn't so bad. I could play a few more games. Man this is getting boring, Hey a new item! This isn't so bad. I could play a few more games. Man this is getting boring, Hey a new item! This isn't so bad. I could play a few more games. Man this is getting boring, Hey a new item! This isn't so bad. I could play a few more games. Man this is getting boring, Hey a new item! This isn't so bad. I could play a few more games...."
Probably one of the most balanced games I've ever played. And addicting :P
cool     
Gotta love tf2 only problem is the scammers that try and take advantage of you other than that it's perfect
This game has good graphics and nice wepons. You should get the game.
11/10
"its a fun fps. while it may have bad weapons for some classes{yes this is a class game,9 classes in fact}it has good maps and characters "
this game has effected me a lot and I think its more than worth getting
I'm writing a review to complete badge tasks.
awesome concept and great for everyone
"TF2 is just a Marvelous game that I can call my favorite out of my gamelist. Everything is just perfect. Balanced classes, Teamwork, Humourous Characters, Trading, Crafting, and did I meantion it is FREE. There is no reason to hate this game at all. If you do not own this game on Steam I don't know what you are doing with your life "
free to play or premium this game is fun no matter what.
"The core game is fine, it's not P2W, the most important items are dropped via achievements, and the stock items are in many cases the best anyways.  What for me destroys the game is the focus on hats or general cosmetic items. For the most part of the community and Valve now, it's no longer about the gameplay. It really is for many players just the Hat Simulator #1, and that's just not my thing. I recommend the game regardless, because although the game can be better if they would focus more on the gameplay, it's a solid shooter with a good class system and a nice art style."
Fun to Play Free to Play Hats What more could you want?
This game is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The only game I know of where you can kill and be killed by people wearing an impossible array of hats.   ALL YOUR HATS  ARE BELONG  TO THE SPY  10/10
pretty good i guess
The virtual hats in my inventory gives me flashbacks to the days where my wallet was full and I had multiple wives.  The sacrifice was worth it.
It's only perfect!
"Love the art style, trading, shooting, weapons, HATS. 11/10"
The epitome of the violent side of human spirit in one game.
um i love the game but cant join scure servers 
"An amazing, amazing game. So much to offer. So much depth. 12/10."
The community is relatively good
"A good multiplayer game. Easy to play, difficult to master. All the maps, customizability, and playing styles will have you playing for years to come. (especially since it's constantly updated)  9.5/10"
TRADE YOUR SOUL
It is fun and if it gets boring u have more ways to play so this game is really cool for filling your time.
I honestly love this game so much. From nooby we learn to be pro at it and be good. Have more friends and more items. I purchased the items so I could build my loadout. The gamemodes are fun and classes. Overall this is a good game
this game is funney and has its laughs but i get it for the textures so i can use them in gmod i give 8/10
" Well guys, this is it."
i highly recommend this game its over-all awesome  its great to play i ooks you in to collect alot of stuff and get rare stuff like hats its great if you have alot of time on your hands !!!!! over-all its awesome
"think that this game is cool. Not 1337 420 360 no scoop cool, realy cool. "
Neat.
"I love TF2 to death, but the 'Meet Your Match' update has killed this game. Unless they make some serious changes, TF2 will die.  Update 7/24/16 It has been nearly a month since the update, and Valve still doesn't seem to understand where the criticism is coming from. Cue times have been improved, but they are still way too long. The 'Casual' gamemode which replaced quickplay is nothing more than a tastless salt mine. Until they fix this game, I quit."
love it end of story
it's very fun!
"This is a review cos why not. The game itself is ok, the loadout system with drops is cool, the copying of CS:GO cases is pretty awful but overall, an ok game."
Team fortress 2 also known as hat trading simulator with guns  10/10
I wish I could afford overwatch.       (And that blizzard allowed molded servers)
"This game is amazing. After playing 300+ hours I can say it's fun, because of the gameplay and the variety of classes, weapons and cosmetics. You need to have a little bit of skill to play this game though because of the ingame classes that you can select. You can change your character's layout while playing and customize your look with different hats and cosmetics.   All in all I can say that this game is definetly worth to play and it's one of the best or even the best free-to-play game ever created!"
wow I hate this new update this is like the new CS GO but cartoon... I hate that I play this for fun not just to win
Ive wasted money and time on virtual hats. Literally of NO use to me. I loved every moment.
"Beatiful game about hats, ONLY HATS! HATS HATS HATS! Wait, did I mentioned HATS?!"
I hate this game.  Nvm I also hate everything it stands for and wish everyone who played just ♥♥♥♥ed off
"'the more hats you own, the better you are at the game'  i was told that when i first started playing tf2, it seemed legit. Still playing and will continue."
"Then everything belong to America. People often ask me what it means to be an American. I tell 'em it's broforce. Broforce. Broforce when we nuke our enemies. Broforce when our flag flutters in the wind on the moon. Broforce when we peer down from the moon and laugh heartily at Russia. Broforce when we depose one dictator after another. Broforce when we break into the homes of terrorist kingpins on the other side of Earth and shoot them in the face. Broforce when we use flying robots to bomb other terrorists in Afghanistan. Broforce when we were the main reason the Nazis were defeated in WWII. Broforce when we freed Europe twice. Broforce. Broforce. Broforce. But it's not just the the big things, see? It's the way I can set up lawn chairs at my friends house on the Texas Rio Grande and share a toast to freedom while watching Mexicans charge into gunfire to enter my country. It's the way an Italian cabbie sits up straight and floors the gas when he hears my accent. It's seeing the wide eyes and bead of sweat running down the forehead of a German customs agent when he opens my passport. It's the way a French waiter hangs his head when I refuse the wine and ask for Coke instead, in English knowing full well he understands me (and that they have it). The way an Aussie blushes and leans into the urinal next to me in the bathroom, or the scowl that meets my smirk when I tip an English waiter in US dollars covered with Washington's face. The way small mobs of Canadian school children follow me from a distance to see what a free man looks like, or how heads timidly rise and women gather when my accent stops the music in the clubs of Amsterdam. Broforce. Every bit of it, broforce. That's what it means to be an American."
It's ok.
"Great game, fun for wasting time and there is ultimately a never ending set of things to learn and experience. Also a comical game and fun for sitting back and talking with other people."
It is awesome
Very nice competitive game.
"Easily my favorite first-person-shooter of all time. The characters, the weapons, the art style, the gameplay, the community, everything is top-notch. Released almost a decade ago and still going strong, and most likely will coninue to do so for a very long time. It's a must-play. I rate a solid 9.5/10."
Best game and Its free!
"Valve, I love this game to the core. I even like this update. (93 people did not find this review helpful) I don't care what anyone else says. If you really want pubs, play a community Skial server. They have stock settings. And If you're recording it, do /logo to remove the colored logo at the bottom. I understand alot of people dislike the game now, but I really love this game more than any other. TF2 team, was this update rushed because of Overwatch? If so, you guys should realize this game was WAY better than overwatch. -Sincerely  Lucas W. A TF2 lover."
The reason i got steam in the first place
"Spy, the class everyone hates, but everyone wants to play. Medic, the class eveyone loves, but noone wants to play. "
The poor man's overwatch 
"&gt;get on Two Cities after honing my skills &gt;get the most damage &gt;team tries to votekick me for low tours &gt;vote fails, the two who voted 'yes' leave &gt;replacement players try to kick me for playing Sniper, but stay (reluctantly) after the vote fails &gt;we win the mission after I shoot the last robot at least ten times in the head 10/10, best community, best priorities, best game."
Really Good Like Food!
this game is awesome its amazing if fact 1 of my fave games
10/10
l'm like to play the tf2 l'm don't like the new update l can not play more Team Fortess 2 because of this update
its a great multiplayer free game for those who want to play free games
"This game is unbelievably amazing, the short time that ive played this game; i enjoy every second of it, even if its moving a payload, destroying robots, or even just meeting and hanging out with friendly people, you'll have a blast!!!"
One of valve's best games. Good gameplay
"Fun game, even runs well on thw older computers. Thanks for actually have a game that is fun and anyone can play, I did not need to get a thousand dollar computer to be able to play."
This game is very enjoyable. There are thousands if servers that give you a different experience. Valve is also is doing a pretty good job at balancing the weapons and all lmaobox hackers were banned so this game is very fair. I would reccomend this game to indivisuals looking to work with others as a team.
Great game! Fun to play never gets boring. But i would still want matchmaking a thing in TF2.
This is a very good game. I like it because its not everyone has the same loadouts and the same advantages because they choose their loadouts and every combination has its advantage and its if you play good with that advantage!
I Love This Game
Way better when u play with friends !
"Honestly? My favorite game! I love it, it's so darn fun! Gets competitive along with a little fun added in! You can get hats, and accessories you want."
great game
f2ps.
Pros: It's a game that is a cartoon based first-person shooter that is so freaking fun! You can dance and not shoot anyone if you want too. Great community.  Cons: in mvm Mann up mode there is tons of bossy dumbies that votekick you for nt listening to them Reason 2's reason can be false cause of the tryhards you have to buy hats and cosmetics.  '9/10 WOULD POOTIS AGAIN - IGN'
the best free-to-play game on steam in my opinion and runs on most pcs
Its good
Exilharating and funny  I had so much fun playing it from the start it is my favorite game of 2014 and 2015.
First game I ever played on pc that dragged me in. If it weren't for this game I wouldn't be on pc
...Theres hats in it. Nuff Said.
"Its pretty good knowing that my favroite classes are heavy,medic,spy,engineer,pyro its the best game ever since its free to play."
"Even though most of the game's community cosists of little children (personal experience), the game is fun. If you are looking for a fast-paced team-based FPS action, this IS the game for you. 8/10"
This game is so awsome
best hat simulator ever
"Okay. So I'll admit, when I first played this game back in early 2014, I was a huge Nintendo console fanboy. I always blindly hated on FPS games, and thought that anyone who said anything negative about Nintendo was an idiot. I had recently gotten a new laptop then, and so, after noticing lots of people talking about this PC game called 'Team Fortress 2', I looked up some gameplay of someone playing Spy. Unlike other FPS games, it looked fun and colorful to me and I wanted to try the game out. I downloaded Steam, then downloaded Team Fortress 2. The next day, I played Team Fortress 2. I went straight to offline practice, and being the noob I was, I didn't know how to even move around. I immediately said 'This game sucks', and didn't consider playing it afterwards.  That was, until I finally decided to buy some games off Steam a few months ago. A friend told me (you know who you are so shoutout to you) I should redownload this game. I decided to listen to him and redownloaded the game. I didn't like it again at first, but after a few days I decided to play it because I was bored. After playing the game for an hour or two, I thought 'Maybe this game isn't so bad after all...'. Come about a week later, I started playing the game more and more. From there, I got hooked. I now have 104 hours in this game, and I take back everything bad I said about this game. Team Fortress 2 is a fun game with many great characters and is getting updated to this day. The best part? It's free to play. Even if you don't like the microtransactions, that's okay! You can still have fun without paying a penny. This game is quickly becoming one of my favorite games of all time. If you can run this game on your PC, I honestly highly recommend it."
it is so adickding
"Fun game, but needs more medic."
Pretty fun. Easy to get used to if you like FPS games online. Overall good game.
"Very good game easy to learn and even though it sounds simple, most of the time its very chaotic.With lots of gamemodes that make it even funner"
"if you don't have the patience to follow valve through for the Meet Your Match update and wait to see how everything turns out, please uninstall the game. Also don't ♥♥♥♥ing queue for casuals and then complain that you just queued for casuals all game. "
cool game valve but i cant competitive please fix but i still like it
"There's no reason not to get Team Fortress 2!   It's free!  It's fun!  And it's an overall great looking game!   So if you want to have some fun with your friends or just want a decent FPS. I recommend Team Fortress 2, just get it! "
"Yes of course, I recommend this game to anyone becuase this game is so fun. I love this game soooooo much, i would die to play this game forever."
Team Fortress 2: -Price:Freaking Free -Value:$99.99
Hours of fun. And a some what decent community
"very addicting, and fun!"
TF2 gives you alot for a free game. One thing that does not give you is that if you dont spend even a penny on it you will be left with small backpack wich does affect on the gameplay. This is because this game have so many weapons that if you want them all you'll need more pages on your backpack.
I REALLY LIKE THIS GAME
"Best available free to play game, hours upon hours of fun. After 2,000 hours of what seems like monotinous time, I still manage to have fun"
"Got over 1100 hours and still suck in this game, but it's fun just playng with friends and learning new stuff..  + Rocket Jumping + Hats + Hats + LOTS OF ♥♥♥♥ING HATS + Taunts + Bad F2Ps  - Good F2Ps "
One of the most fun games in the world ever til the end of time
"I've spent almost $5 on this game, and upgraded to Premium account. Purchase any item on the store, and you will not regret buying it. Aside from the system, TF2 is undoubtedly and immeasurably great. People say that OVERWATCH is TF3. Compared to that game, TF2 is better, I think."
Take It... Hold It... Love It...
Great game recommend 10/10
One of the best F2P out there
"This Game Very Fun with loads of robots!, and has some fun maps to play on!"
"tf2 is one the games that you really have to try, it is Free to Play and has an outstanding unique first-person shooter. Unlike most FPS that is played competitively It focuses more on fun and especially humor. Some people dislike tf2 for that reason, see, beyond being the humoring and non competivte way Team Fortress 2 is actually a very, very good class based shooter. TF2 has a various types of character classes and game modes, a bunch of maps and hats. But the kind of big reason it is such a great game is, over the years, Valve has born that old maxim out through Team Fortress 2, multiple times over. The game has been played since 2007 and me personally, I think thats a pretty crowning achivement"
It was great I wish it was more like an FPS and enemies had less health
"Good game in all, i think they we're pretty smart with most updates, however, the 'Meet you Match' update, was a huge step backwards. I think we can all agree that waiting 2 to 3 minutes just to get into a casual match is no fun. in that time i could be in a CS:GO comp match already. Besides that its fairly fun."
Its a good game to increase suicidal tendencies.
"Team fortress 2 is one of the best f2p (free to play) games out there!. This game is really fun to play, and coop loadout and character looks combinations. Best game to play it recommend it!!!"
Killed invis spy got a mlp ♥♥♥ spray. Fapped would fapp again 11/11
GOOD GAME INDEED
Really Fun Interested Game.

- play sniper for a couple of hours to become decent - find a pub - headshot 2 people in a row - get yelled at in voicechat whilst they're trying to voteban you  such a great game
IGN 11/10   Fun to do animations with this game. And this game is good to play
"Lots of good times in this game. The community is cancer now and the gameplay, while fresh for its genre, is noticably dated. But, I'll be lying if I say it hasn't been fun. After passing a month of total gameplay time, the game has finally died for me, and I really only enjoy playing it with friends now. Still a fun game overall though, and I still recommend it."
"Great game, love it, should improve the ingame trading though."
"Trolls, Trolls everywhere!!"
'TIME TO KICK SOME ♥♥♥ AND CHEW BUBBLEGUM BUT IM ALL OUT OF GUM'
"After 9 years after being released, it is still worth it!"
one of the best games i played yet :D
I don't know why. This game make me laugh everytime i get killed.
Nice game!!!
"Team Fortress 2 is a really good and fun game. I have been playing it since 2011 and after some breaks i always get back to it. The game is almost 10 years old, but still fantastic and has always renewable content. The character customization is also amazing and many customization options makes you unique in the community. The only negative thing i can mention that there is still no competitive mod avaliable.  I dearly recommend this game to everyone, your age doesn't matter. One good advice: bring yoruself a lot of friends. :)"
Hey that's pretty good
It is a nice game I would really suggest downloading this game.
"really enjoyed this game and it dominated as a clas sbased shooter. From the personality to your mercs to the insane skills of other players, you were challenged to fight the right fight and WIN!!! I loved this game and is ONE of my favorites!"
i thought this game was pretty good until the new update where it decided everytime you get into the game it crashes
Dis Game Is 10/10 IGN :) Pootis Was here
This game is actually better than doing my homework.. 'Naimul Sayem'
"Yeah, sure. It is a good game. But when joining casual servers, or some community servers, my screen freezes at the loading screen. IF there is anyway anyone can help. please do. I have tried everything like verify the integrity of the game cache."
How I met my wife.  10/10
Great game for the people who like first person shooters. Only problem is the removal of valve servers. But the game is still good
not the best but good
I got vac banned because my connection was bad and it caused my game to lagg 
TF2 is one of my faviorte game of all time because of these reasons:  1.Creative classes 2.Awesome weapons 3.Hats :3  Overall. This is my faviorte First Person Shooter
Great game to become rich!
THE BEST THING SINCE FISH FINGERS AND CUSTARD!!!
This game is currently going throught some tough times but I believe it will all come together in the end. TF2 is easily my favorite game of all time and I definatley recomend it to others.
"great game, but there has been a update valve PLLZ fix pub servers ;("
Nice games
"Team Fortress 2 is without a doubt the best FPS game I have ever played and probably the best one I will ever play! And that comes from someone who generally dislikes shooters.  The cartoony characters, the unique playstyles for all the classes, the unlockable weapons (and hats), and the different types of matches will keep you playing this game for tens to hundreds of hours.  Best part: It's completely free!"
"i really enjoy this game  sum simple rulez: no hats = noob f2p= noob kill ppl when they are dancing = noob tryhard beg for items = noob f2p on trade servers = noob, gtfo f2p kills p2p = noob hacker report ♥♥♥♥ kid on mic = fkin idiota stfu pls, and no, i wont mute him, ill just swear at him body shot with sniper = noob no aim lmaobox = noob trading on public servers = noob gtfo n goto trade servers ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ur famous = OMG LEMME DONATE, OMG IM IN VIDEO? OMGOMG STRIM SNIPE, ADD FRIEND PL0X PLS has 1000+ hrs = get a life noob  = most ppl on tf2 r like dat :P"
i really like this it really enjoible
Great game
This game is so awesome
love cancer  10/69 would drink bleach again
"Team fortress is ssssssssssooooooooooooooooooooo fun, because of gatterling guns, rocket launchers, fish and others"
Most fun i have ever had in playing a game
Best hat simulator of the year. I like when the scout beats up the big fat baldy heavy guy.
Great game
"Grate Game Mate, Rate 8/8, No hate"
"When determining whether Team Fortress 2 is an epic game, just remember that it is going strong after 7 years. It's a place where Eight year olds, furries, extremely rich and poor people, racists, child predators, and a few decent people come together to argue with each other and blame everything but themselves for their death!"
Ruined my life and spent over £40 :) Must Have!
"'You can never have enough hats, and they can never be orange enough' --Most Trada-est Trada in TF2"
Lost all my items in a scam trading back up for them.
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
Best Business simulator out there!
"The best shooter since counter strike, and we all know how fun and interesting that game is."
this is game about hats
"Great community, many different servers to try out! good game~"
This is a good game.
Its Good! 
It's like Skyrim with guns! - IGN 10/10
Best game EVER!!!! Basics to it anything that makes you move faster Equip. Speed is the most important thing in this fast action packed fps.
"TF2 used to be the king of the goofy, cartoony, and funny action fps genre, but this giant of a game was threatened by a new challenger, 'Overwatch'. So TF2 accepted this challenge, stepped up to the plate, and just F&amp;%#ing blew it! With the launch of the 'Meet your match update' pubs and quickplay have been replaced by a pseudo-competitive mode which is nearly identical to the real competitive mode (btw the only difference is one of them is free). You can also no longer select which map you'de like to play in whith a lengthy list of maps being dissabled entierly. With the massive influx of aimbot cheaters I can only begin to imagine the terrible ways they have crippled VAC, more often than not there will be a considerable amount of players in the lobby using something called LMAOBOX, and if that wasn't enough the chat will likely be dissabled and be replaced by ad spamming for this LMAOBOX.  The bigger they are the harder they fall.  Edit: Steam censors the name of the Aimbot for understandable reasons."
got this game 3 years ago and im still playing it
"This game ruined my life, I have NO money and no sparetime. My family deserted me, and my friends abonded me. I am nothing, an empty shelll of a person.  I highly recommend this game."
"Great game if you want to kill some time, or just wear some hats."
"A nice, simple, fast paced &amp; overall fun game! When I first noticed this game, I was a bit skeptical after seeing the graphics etc. thankfully I was proven wrong. The gameplay is really fast paced &amp; fun, + with all the different classes, each of them offering a different play style, this game will ensure multiple hours of fun! All of this, &amp; not having to pay a single penny (The game is free to play after all) :)"
Really interesting game! :D
"Great RTS Game, fun for all levels of expertise, decent graphics and medium learning curve. Online play can be unforgiving if you dont know what your doing. 8.5/10"
Spend 2000 hours in this is not problem... Worth to have premium account for more options especially trading and more space in your backpack.
Very fun game! A must download for everyone!
Best game love the trading and the economy
can't create my own server anymore
Its fun!
"9 classes. lots of guns, 100% Skyrim. 10/10"
"TF2 is an amazing game, IMHO the best multiplayer shooter of the time. Even better than older shooters in THEIR time, in fact. It's extremely well-balanced, despite what morons who play the 'best' classes will tell you. Any class is capable of getting many kills and topping the team's scores if they know how and where to use them.   I have not played this on XBOX 360 but again, in my opinion, Halo 3 is not anything to brag about and i'm sure the XBOX 360 version of this game beats it, no competition. The PC version certainly does."
10/10 best hat shooter sim.
Best hat simulator ever 9/11
An easy way to get rich on steam! It's fun as well as competetive.
"It wouldn't be an overstatement to say that the most played game i have on steam is TF2. Hours of fun, tons of weapon varieties.  I've fought agaisn't and with amazing and horrible teams, i've made amazing friends, and when you think this game has nothing else to offer on it's variety, you look up the server browser and see modded servers that work completely different than the normal game.  All the weapons that are acquirable in the shop can be dropped and/or crafted in this game, the only paid related thing to it would be Hats and Inventory space, but to be honest, most of my time spent in this game was spent as a F2P player, and i don't regret a single moment spent in this game.  TL;DR: This game offers lots of variety, is not Pay 2 Win and offers hours of entertainment.  I hope that if you, the reader, ever give it a go, enjoy this game as much as i did."
Awesome game. Very fun and addicting.
"It's a amazing game and very awesome,cool,and addicting."
"Simply put, TF2 is a comical FPS that redefines what we look for in a shooter game. This game never gets old. In addition to the addicting gameplay, there's a whole economy of trading that comes with it. All in all, TF2 is a must-have for any and all game collections."
hats        11/10
"MOST FUN YOU CAN EVER HAVE Elias 2014  I would say a good game best game i have ever played. I play it everyday , i got this game last year and now i still play it and its not boring i would say you should get it. Tf2 is now free to play and totally diffrent than other FPS multiplayersbetter than call of duty i say.   there are so many different gamemodes in this game and my favourite is payload and like everyone says  HATS!!!  There are nine different classes and you must work together to complete your objective and have fun in the same time. You can play in many ways. Offence , defence you can choose what you wanna play  10/10 PLAY IT WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, JOIN THE FUN FOR HATS!!!!!"
"Simplistic, ridiculous, yet so overly fun to play :D"
The best fun you can have in PC now FREE :D
Best game in steam evah!!!!
very fun and addictive
Wasted all my money in items and ruined my life 100/100
Best Hat-Simulator of the Year! 5/5
ITS JUST FUN!
For a game that was made quite a long time ago and a computer that was made in 2014 jesus this game is awfully optimised. This game seriously has performance issues and many other things like a raging community and disappointing updates that valve never test runs or anything like that at all. Valve Get your ♥♥♥♥ together. I bet Overwatch would run much better than your game that went from a personal 90 to a clear cut 65. I still love this game but not as much now. God Forbid you take away the community servers than your getting a 20 and I'm selling my tf2 backpack and buying a marginally better game. Also the new casual mode is ok but still quickplay was fast and easy while it takes upwards 10 mintutes to find a specific game with the map you want like High tower and 2fort. I don't recommend this game to newer players as they will only know what the bad stuff is. If by some blue moon all the planets arrange in a perfect orbit and valve makes a good update to this game is when I strongly recommend you hop into casual mode. but as of 8/7/2016 (american style) its not as good as it can be.
"great game I love it and you should 2,realy its a great first person shooter with a great veriate of weapons and hats also if you spend money to get other cool items! ($_$) "
I feel like removing my skull and beating myself to death with it after playing this game for 2000 hours. 10/10 I love it ty Gabe.
"Pros: -Intiutive, fast-paced, and fun gameplay -9 varied classes that suits several different playstyles -You don't spend most of your time looking down the iron sghts of a gun -The weapons are incredibly balanced with a potent disadvantage for every beneficial advantage -The game values the player's fun over realism -The comedic and surrealistic aesthetic is timeless and has aged well -The wit and humor is never out of place and always funny -You don't suck your thumb behind a wall to regenerate health -It's easy to join and play with friends -Gameplay is easy to learn, but hard to master -Has a fun PvE mode -Hundreds of weapons to collect -Everything useful is free -Has an excellent musical score -The game modes are designed to encourage teamwork  Cons: -Random crit system is unbalanced   TL:DR version: Get it now because the pros overwhelm the cons since TF2 is such an excellently crafted game. It will be worth the $0.00 you payed for it."
great gAme!
"help, how does this game work"
10/10!!!!
"A great Free to play game. I never get bored playing this, as it has a large variety of weapons and things you can try out."
I kicked a man while yelling 'Pass the Whiskey'. Wait...wat
this...THIS was the original reason I got steam
"This is as good as it gets! Free to play multiplayer/co-op game with cool characters, community maps and tradeable items. The yearly special events are awesome!"
This game is a really good game i recommend this game for anybody
"Lol, it doesn't even need any postive reviews.. this game's history stands for it."
"This game is referred to as the best ( or second best, depends on whether you prefer this or DOTA 2) free to play title ever created. I personally agree with this statement to a certain level; but I can not help but feel that I must disagree with this statement. This games presentation is amazing. From the menus, to the design and layout of the maps, I can actually feel all the work put into the development of this game. The menus use a basic layout that have both a simple and complex feel to them. You are presented with a wealth of options to adjust your gameplay experience; but you ever feel overwhelmed by the number of options available. Graphically, this game is nothing sepcial by 2013's standards; but back in 2007 this game was beautiful. It's cartoonish style and the charm of all it's characters draw you in rather easily. The maps themselves are rather amazing to look at, though some are better than others. The gameplay is what really draws many people in. It consists of classes that possess both strengths and weaknesses ( basically they are well balanced). The gameplay changes with each class and you will always have a preferrence of classes. However, the gameplay could eventually feel repetitive and soon turn a person off of the game. But to conteract this, valve releases weekly updates for the game and have enable trading within this game. The game will reward a player with loot for either earning a certain number of achievements, completing certain tasks or for just playing the game. The loot can either be considered useless, useful, stupid or great; but that all depends on class and preference for the type of loot. I personally love playing as the sniper and am thrilled whenever I unlock a new sniper rifle. The game also features crafthing, which motivates players into buying or earning certain items just to get another. Overall, the game is great and I certainly think that it is highly enjoyable; but I feel that most of that enjoyment comes from the offers valve tosses our way when we play TF2, which is not really good for the game's reputation. I hope that I proved to be of some assistance; and please remember that this is my opinion and everyone's opinion varies. Thanks for reading!"
This game shows me a decent way of cooperation with team and vulgar words to be used :) 
Who needs a social life when you got hats and a conga?
"Had it sitting in my library for at least a year having originally barely played it (two hours not really knowing what I was doing) until recently where I was looking for a casual and fun game to help get someone into gaming. Decided to try and see if this game would work and long story short, they love it and I'm shocked at how much they've been playing it. I'm even quite addicted at this point too.  Needless to say, the game is great and I wish I had given it some attention sooner."
OH LET ME JUST TELL U AMAZING GAME U GOT HERE
thanks you
 Team Fortress 2 Review
ood game trading alot
"Team Fortress 2 is a game that is well balanced, well thought out and just plain fun to play for hours on end.  The classes are well made and each serve their purpose on the battlefield, whether it be capping points, crowd control, moving troops forward via teleporters or heal your teammates, every class feels engaging, fun to play and feels like you're adding to your team's victory.  Also, hats."
"I made more friends on this game than any other! This is one of Valves finest. Team Fortress 2 is a unique first person shooter full of classes, weapons and hats! There are 9 different classes, you can play them all when ever, where ever. There are a bundle of weapons to mess around that you get in a cleaver drop system. The greatest part of this FPS is the fact that it is free!"
"TF2 is love, TF2 is life...  The #1 fps themed hat simulator."
"Team Fortress 2. This isn't a realistic shooter. This is game that is made by one of the most best game making companies, in my opinion. When I first got the orange box, TF2 was just one of those games that I just played once and didn't bother again. But then one day came when I had nothing to play, and it grew into an obsession. This was a game where not only could I enjoy myself, but find people like me. I would encourage for people to get this game because it is so amazing. And it is a free to play game so you have nothing lose. :D"
A simple Must-Have for all steam users!
This is game is worth every hour you play it :)
"Very fun game, definitely would recommend the game"
"Team Fortress 2. Valve knew what they were doing on this game! It's fun addicting, rage inducing and meal skipping and definitly worth your while! Especialy scince it's free to play! Anyone who doesn't have this game, I definitly recommend this to you and all of your friends!"
"If you don't have it already, get it. TF2 should be mandatory with Steam.  Really solid game in every way. The core game is fun and well-balanced despite the huge difference throughout the 9 classes. The content is sprawling; so many maps, so many items, and many different modes to play, not to mention surf maps, dodgeball maps, jump maps. The skills development is great; several classes excellent for beginners, many classes excellent to master. The business model is the best there is: microtransactions for vanity items only, free to play otherwise. Absolutely everything that affects the gameplay is available freely, and not behind some obnoxious grind; new weapons just come at a steady pace. Fast enough to not feel like you're being patronised, slow enough to still leave you hanging for something in particular you might have your eye on. Many vanity items can be crafted (which is a grind), while many cannot and require real money to get put into a rares/unboxing system. This is also done well, and it's just a great system all round. And the only reason it works as a business model, despite absolutely everything that involves gameplay being free, is because the game itself is simply that good and popular that people want to put money into hats and strange weapon visuals.   But what I really like most about TF2 is its character. There is *so much* dialog in the game. You'll hear the characters saying funny things pretty much constantly, but it's not in your face, and after 1000 hours I'm still hearing new cracks from the characters. The scout is hilarious, heavy is cute in a massive Russian kind of way (if you've been firing for say 30 seconds without stopping, he'll start singing). The spy might sarcastically ask a solider he just killed 'How ever will they replace you?', while the soldier himself is just funny in his low intelligence. Once I have heard him singing about his ex-roommate, which is just so amusing. Wtf are you doing singing, soldier?  Speaking of his ex-roommate, that's Merasmus. So what? Lore. TF2 does *not* take itself seriously, but it has so much lore it's fantastic to see it clicking together as time passes. The Source movies you'll find on Youtube are oozing with history, and their little touches result in updates in the game, like the scar on the Sniper's cheek, the entirety of Pyrovision, bread appearing in teleporters, or the Scout mentioning his bucket of chicken. Even better, the comics. TF2 has comics and damn, they are good. I don't even get into comics, but the ironic humour and characterisation is just so good. I know I'm meant to be writing about the game here, but TF2's comic is seriously one of the best comics out there. Probably. I'm no expert.  Also really good music. Not stuff you'd sit and listen too, but really good for the game's character and well produced.   There's more I could say but the short of it is that TF2 is so commonplace that its easy to understate how good it is. It's just really, really solid. Core gameplay: solid, gameplay variety: huge, content: abundant, character and lore: amazing, business model: perfect. It won't blow you away visually these days, but TF2 is easily one of my most respected games."
Can't play overwatch on my computer.   So TF2 is the next best thing 10/10
best game ever! youlll have so much with this game is super fun and addictive you can meet some new friends too
Well as a former TF2 player the new update ruind the game...
"This game is honestly he best game i personally have ever played. There are so many different options in this game! You could play for fun or competition, trade, or compete in highlander competitions! I have so much fun playing this game and i hope anyone else who plays this will have fun too!"
i really reccomend this game because its awesome.
"Game iz good deal. Purple text hats every where. I promise good game, killing all da baddies."
completley worth the money 10/10
Spawn. Kill Someone. Earn A Hat. Get A Weapon drop. Craft A Weapon. Become A p2p. Craft Scrap Metal. Craft Reclaimed Metal. Craft Refined Metal. Buy More Hats With The Refined Metal. Trade Hats For Keys. Trade Keys To get An Unusual. Sell The Unusual For More Than U Bought It For. Be Rich.  10/10 BEST GAME EVER
"What a ♥♥♥♥ing mess of an update, might as well start playing Overwatch."
"I've played and love this game for years... but the removal of the Valve pub servers has removed all enjoyable casual play from the game. Combined with the silly wait times for 'casual' competitive play, and the disconnect after two rounds, has made me realize it's time to leave the game behind. It's been a blast for the past 5+ years TF2, but it's time to move on."
This game is awesome awesome graphis and shooting and it is also free!
Took procrastintation to a whole new level.  Hat/10
"It's like crack-cocaine, but with hats!"
Very fun
"thanks for killing the only remotely playable part of the game, valve servers just as i was getting into it"
"A very good game, anyone who didnt get it please do its free and absolutely awesome :D"
Wonderful game to have on steam. Keeps me entertained for hours!
this game is too good!
this is best game
"MyM has made a mess of the game, it seems to be slowly getting fixed, but right now I can not reccomend its matchmaking, Go play UGC and the like if you want actual comp."
"This is the first time I have ever reviewed a game. Had I felt the need to write a review of Team Fortress 2 before the most recent update it would have been positive to point of being sycophantic. I love this game. The design, the maps, the art...everything was brilliant. It showed that people somewhere had really thought about all aspects of entertainment and I would have rated it easily as my #1 game. Then it was updated.  Previously I could create my own list of favourite servers where the admin had created a server which appealed to my preferred gaming style. I could choose my own maps that were played repeatedly. I could choose to join a server with or without bots. I could choose to join a server where any chat was likely to be in my own language. I could join a server and stay on it all night if I wished. I prefer to play with instant respawn. Not any more.  Today, I have to make my game style choices then wait, and wait, and wait until a server is picked for me, playing a map I may never have encountered or don't even like with players chatting predominantly in a language that isn't my own. Then after a couple of games the whole process starts again. I'm presented with stats about servers around the world. Not interesting, not required, stop wasting time, just get me to a server of my choosing.  Before the update it was a case of join a favourite server, play as long as I wanted, have fun, say goodbye and leave. Now, the frustration of all the waiting between games just f***s me off and I end up finding other software to play. Sometimes I know the pain that trying to play TF2 will bring so I skip it altogether. Where I used to play for a few hours, I now can't tolerate the waiting for more than 2 or 3 games because it is that bad. It's as though the system reverts to dial-up to find a server!  Historically I have raved to other FPS gamers about TF2. Not only do I do that any longer but I'm also angry that anyone who tries the game now on my recommendation is going to think I'm an idiot for giving it my support.  I'm usually a positive kind of person but fail to see any improvement with the current update. Without one ounce of exaggeration, if I made mistakes in my line of work as big as the mistakes made in the recent changes to TF2, people would die.  I can only imagine that the meeting that took place to approve these changes must have been like being in one of those recurring bad dreams where you can see the danger, but no matter how loud you shout to warn them, no sound comes out and bad stuff happens.  Having been a gamer since before Action Quake I've never seen anything this destructive.  It is with a heavy heart that that a former 'Yes' recommendation is now a resounding 'No' and will stay 'No' until my previous playing experience is resumed or improved upon. "
I ENJOY but the fact is that many ♥♥♥♥ lords and dumbd are playing. this by far the only thing i dislike about the game. the other thig i don't like is that the fact that the severs are crap and the respawn time is in my opinion to long. and to many dam kids why ?
This game is probbably the best Free to Play game i have ever played! So much fun you cant imagine!My favorite game!

10/10 this cured my crippling depression
One of the best free games on the market with constant updates the game is fun for everyone and is not a scam like so many other free to play games are 10/10 would spend 200 on cases agine

Very intresting and fun game
"a very good game, get it while the sale is on now!!!!!! only down side is... it gets a little annoying if you keep getting killed by those damn spys!!"
This is my favorite game ever
"This is hell full of Hats  GABEN PLEASE ADD WEAPONS (btw, itz awezome ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
"Still an epic game, even after a load of updates"
-Starts TF2 -Plays Sniper -Gets yelled at for playing Sniper -Plays Pyro -Gets yelled at for playing Pyro -Plays Spy -Gets yelled at for playing Spy  10/10 Would get yelled at again
A must-have for anyone who loves FPS and its free! Has a good amount of server to expirment and play on.
best if your looking for a challenge
Wasted hours playing.....   Will waste many more....  Great game to play with friends.
"I think that this game is very fun to play, but it crashes everytime I join a game. Warning! Mac users, do not play!"
"Team Fortress 2, the Orange Box hit by Valve from '07. Ya know, with most games it's good for a couple years, then it and the community itself dies down a bit; I remember the Guncraft beta servers were almost always full! For the final version, it's difficult to find a good server with over zero players logged in. Team Fortress 2 is different. Team Fortress 2 is five, going on six years old yet billions still play. It may be running on a slightly-outdated engine, but the cartoonish feel compensates for that; the gameplay is both entertaining and makes you want to punch a hole through your monitor, especially with those god forsaken Scouts. Overall, this game is a definate 11 out of 10, and I don't know about you, but I see myself playing every day for the forseeable future."
"Team Fortress 2 is easily one of the most addictive games I have ever played. The gameplay is very simple, You are either on RED or BLU, Fighting one and other ina variety of objective based gamemodes. This forces players to work together as a team. This game is NOT for the Lone Wolf.  What makes TF2 unique is it's insane amount of customaztion. The game features 9 distinct classes, Each with their own Personality, Play-Styles, Designs and weapons. From the Speedy, Loud-Mouthed Scout, To the Insane, Mad Scientist Medic, Each class is unique. This add's depth to this game. There is ALWAYS something new to do and experience.  The Community have kept this game alive with constant Mod's and inventive gamemodes, While the TF2 team keep the game fresh with constant free content. Whether is new weapons or New hats, Each update keeps players interested.  On top of all of this, TF2 features a very unique art style. This makes it stand out amongst all the other Military shooters. It's cartoonish, 1960's style, Makes it simply beautiful. Valve certianly did a fantastic job in creating a unique world for this game.  TF2 is also damn hilarious, With a barrage of Meme's, Quotes and Dark Humor to keep anyone happy. While the humor isn't always for everyone, It certainly get's me laughing to myself as I Gib a Pesky Spy.  While TF2 has lost some of it's core charm due to trading/players, It still remains one of Valve's greatest hits. TF2 is a must have for ANY PC gamer.  Also, It is free. And you can wear fancy Hats/  If you have yet to experience TF2, I would heavily reccomend to download it right now.  9.5/10."
Very fun
this is one of my favorite games i have ever played!
Very Good! Needs Less Hackers Though Ayy!
"Best game, it has a class for everyone"
"This is the best game in my opinion it isn't to confusing to learn the game, and I play this game all the time"
i think its a great game but take a lot to getting used to. if you think overwatch is better theat your opinion cuz maybey you just suck at this game. i think overwatch is also a good game but i like tf2 better.
Ive been playing this game for years now and ive always loved it. It has changed a good but with the new meet your match update. I like making a party but still I liked how it used to be. I understand its not for everyone. But you never really know till you try it.
This game just doesn't get old. I can't stop coming back.
"A good game for all mature ages, with hats."
"Please THUMBS UP I tried to do everything i CAN I AM not just a player Please THUMBS, UP PLEASE PLEASE."
"   Team Fortress 2 Valve, 2007  "
Awesome game. Great community. Check it out!
"A great classic! Mostly due to the DANK MEMES and its gameplay style, and quirky charectars!"
I like this game aloth but all i know is cosmetics = skill
Cool game
"One day you're using stock weapons and learning how to rocket jump, next thing you know, you've got a strange sapper and you know how to stairstab. Not recommended if you want a life."
"First of all, this game is free and your friends could be like: 'THAT GAME SUCKS, ITS NOT REALISTIC!' well, it is not realistic but it's the top action, cosmetics-collecting game. Although, random crits might ♥♥♥♥ you off sometimes, and free-2-plays, and w+m1's... with a bunch of other types of annoying gamers. when you perfect/master a skill that you have been dreaming of and tirelessly practising like trickstabs or rocket jumps, I promise you that this is not a bad game after all. I started this game knowing nothing, absolutely NOTHING. Then, I started watching Muselk, Star_, Snow... The TF2 YouTubers, the ones who thinks that this is a great game to make videos on. This game is the game that requires patience, using your deduction skills and timing. If you have those skills, then you would be a great beginner to this game."
roses are red  violets are blue Tf2 is a super glue (becasue i cannot stop playing it)
"Great game, community is real nice"
I love it! I have played many Shooters but by far this one is the most fun! 10/10
THIS IS A FUN GAME MUST PLAY!!!!
rocket jumps and more . . . . . . . . . . . . lots more . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . mostly cosmetics though . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ok
best shooter game in years
"As one of the first PC games I've ever played this game will always have a place within my heart. Tf2 changed my view on FPS games substantially and continues to impress me. When I first joined the Team Fortress community it was very welcoming, but as expected there were many toxic people who'd rather push newbies away rather than help them grow as a player. As a player with many hours I'd reccommend this game to anyone.  The game has a very charming industrial style and a great selection of characters to choose from, my favorites being the Pyro and Engineer. The soundtrack is great, I listen to many of the songs in my free time.  Keep up the good work Valve. "
"It a great game, the original was good but the this version is much better"
"Fun game, but needs to add a few more CTF maps......."
This game is amazing.
My first experience was with a man kicking wildly while Russian music blared in my ears. He was talking to me. I studied his lips as he expressed his personal opinion.  'I focked ur mum m8'  10/10 woulf meet again
An awsome game for starters in fps...I geu
-Play Casual -Join a Dustbowl match -Join Red -Let Blu win the first round -Get 2 medics -Round Starts -Start mowing down enemies -Get the whole team to spawn camp -Blu can't get out -A Blu spy managed to cap both of the points 11/Harambe
"A Good And Fun Multiplayer Game, With A Cartoon-ish Style."

I Like this game. I played this game for a total of 330 hours :)
Its like Overwatch except good.
"If you don't have TF2 yet then you are making a BIG MISTAKE. (In my opinion.) Such a fun game, with a really lively community too! Highly recommended."
Just Do It!
very nice game :D
One of the best games all time and best hat simulator in the world
Really nice FPS
"Very fun game! I would recommend this game to anyone that has very played a FPS game before, or if you just want a good time!"
Nice game !
"defiantly one of the best fps game, I just love the game, fast paced, fun, addictive af awesome game"
"One work , FUN!  I love working with a team to kill the other team. I can never be bothered aiming to get the achievments, I just want to have fun!  But... I did find it a bit annoying when people go straight for you and those machines, UGH!  But it still is a great game and one of my favorites. :)"
"Freakin best game ever, has a fun friendly nature, isnt 100% splash damage in that you need a level of skill to actually play (cough cough you know what game im talking about) even though the community is super fun and driven there is still a very serious competitive scene for those types of people."
Gr3at gaem m8 420/69 lol #famlit aXe De funny lol haha G3t @ lyfe lul lol lel lal pootis pow. Come we fight like men
this game has been throo a lot but it has a place in my heart forever
"This game is so good I can't describe it with words. only with a screenshot of 11 heavies standing on the last point of coldfront with their miniguns reved up, can I truly describe the nature of this wonderful game."
It is extremely easy to play and fun (NOT RECCOMMENDED FOR ANGER ISSUED PEOPLE)
I love the game but the competitive update just killed it
"After spending hours upon hours of playing this game, after wasting money and time, after trading for countless nights, do i regret it?  No.   This first person hat simulator is a glorious piece of vidya.  Ruined my life- 9.5/10 ~ign."
i love the game its comedy and everything it the BOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS GAME for me 
great game
+rep very nice hat simulator
"An old classic, kind of ruined because of Overwatch, but still playable and fun. I dont play it so much anymore but I have a lot of memories since I installed it right away when I singed up for Steam, not aware of how the game is actualy popular."
its just a fun fps with a cartoony artstyle and a great community to interact with its free to play so feel free to try it and see what you think of it.
It's fine I guess.
THIS GAME IS SO FUN I RECOMEND IT TO ALL PEEPS OF DA WORLD  
This game is a fun game where you have 9 different classes to choose from and play with your friends
"This game is perfect for everyone becasue you can do whatever you want. You can go competitive, pub, and much, much, more!"
A very fun game rate it 10/10 keep up the great work!! would 100% recommend it to the world!! so keep up the good work!!
"Obviously a very fun multiplayer game. The only thing I haven't quite figured out, or which could be a flaw, is that there doesn't seem to be a great transition from random servers to more competitive gameplay."
the Mann.co Crates need to have less costing keys because i have alot of boxes in which i want to use them but the keys are just expensive
"Things I gave to Team Fortress 2 1. Money 2. Time 3. Love  Things Team Fortress 2 gave me: 1. Arthritis 2. Rage 3, Hatred of Russians,Turkish, and Russians 4. Broken keyboard 5. Broken mouse  7. Server crashes 8. Multilingual cursing - I guess this is a good thing? 9. Lag 10. Cheaters   Essentially - TF2 is a greedy woman, but I love her all the time.  11 / 10 would play again"
"So, TF2 Is easily my Favorite FPS. Although it's a Vacuum for Money and Time, Its Money and Time I'm glad to spend on this game. I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. Creative Characters, Unique Humor, Satisfying Sounds, Appealing Artstyle, and oh god, the hats."
NORMAL HAT IN REAL LIFE: $20 HAT IN TEAM FORTRESS 2: $500  CRAP TON OF FUN
"Why play Overwatch when TF2 is free, and has more features? 10/10 would ♥♥♥♥ off the Blizzard horde again."
"For years now, Team Fortress 2 has been the worlds best war-based hat simulation software.  With hundreds of different hats for the 9 Hatwearers available, Team Fortress 2 ensures your character looks dapper while being slaughtered by people with better looking hats.  Oh, and theres guns and fighting too. Whatever.  8.2/10 'Not enough hats'-IGN"
I really like this game. It offers unique gameplay the dosen't have to be competetive. It's also funny at times and is relaxing to play.
This is the best game ever
A Fun game to play it with your friend
Pretty neat
Overwatch is cool
Best Game ever made and its free!
Team Fortress 2 is the funnest game I ever played. There are so much content and play styles. You can customize your class in so many ways thanks to the endless amounts of hats. 10/10 would rate again.  
"Okay so TF2 is a really good game. Theres just one problem for me. I was on a trade server and my TF2 crash suddenly. So when i launched it again, after the Valve and Source logo went away. The game crashed. It kept doing the same thing. Can you please fix this error? "
"Team Fortress 2 2007-2016 You were good son, real good maybe even the best!  #HopeForTF2"
Best game that you can play for free!!! 10/10 will tf2 again
"Best hat simulator 2016, been going through some tough times but hats shall prevail"
This Game is fun and will keep you excited for hours
If you like FPS games this will be a fan favorite to all steam players so go get this damn game 
Nice game and one of the most important thigs in this game is the comunity market :D
RLY GOOD GAME I LOVE IT  TF2 VS CS GO  TF2 HAVE HATS CS GO NO  TF2&gt;CSGO
This game ruined my life
10/10 
"Great game, great content. Spent many a day just relaxing with this game"
hats n YAWK
very good game! if u want a game that has FPS elements and custimaztion this is the game for you! I would give this a 9/10 stars.
The best FPS and TPS shooter I have ever played.
Tf2 is a great game with 9 very unique classes to choose from. It is so much fun with friends and i would definetely recommend this game to others.
"Probably the best free2play title you'll ever stumble upon, it doesn't force microtransactions on you, and you can easliy win and beat p2p players as well."
Just doing this for badge   Its good
Very fun can be laggy at times but thats just me.
"This game is unlike other FPS games. There is a lot of customization which makes nearly no one similar, and that ands distinctiveness. Overall the mechanics and modes are fun. Although the in-game shop merchandise is a bit overpriced, it's still a good game."
"Here we go again, the true shining jewel of Valve, just like Half-Life 1 and 2 were Humoristic design? Check Constant FREE updates? Check (almost) always balanced weapons? Check Hat economy worth actually millions of dollars? Check A great game, save for occasional lag issues, hackers and bugs. But what game doesn't have that? TF2 sucked me in 2 years ago after it first went F2P and now, 2 years later, with over 1.000 hours on record, I can say that you MUST give it a try if you haven't already  P.S: HATS"
This is a must have! Best FTP game ever! &lt;3
"Nice, awsome and cool game!"
if you like killing and working as a team this fps game is the perfect game for you
"It's a great game. But over the years, tf2's community has gotten worse and worse. And with all the phyishers and scammers out there, the trading community has also gotten bad.   I would still recomend tf2, but I wouldn't suggest putting a lot of money and effort into the game."
Reallly Gooood
"I love this game. I really do. That's why I have over 1,000 hours on it. Every single thing about it is great. But, the one, SINGLE, thing that makes me hate it is the freaking people who play it. There is a select amount of people who are good, but about, I say, 80% of the people who play it are either: screaming 5 year olds, trollers who wont shut up, hackers who ruin the entire game for everyone, people who think they are better than everyone, and last just your classical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I'm sorry if I'm sounding harsh, but this is how I see it. I just needed to say this and this is the only place I could think of. Thank you for reading and good day."
this game is awesome i never get bored of it :) :)
love it. good for all ages
"A very fun game overall. Each class doesn't seem to overpowered, with strengths and weaknesses. The games free, so if you have Steam just download it in your free time and start playing. The weapons are so varied and each has a possible potential to be useful. Also has a variaty of maps, and different gamemodes.  I'm NOT saying these are the best classes, just my opinion.

TF2 in a nutshell"
"This review is split into sections, using numerals to show each section.  All in all a 10/10 game. You should be playing this right now.  I There are several game modes: CTF (Capture the Flag or briefcase in this game), TDM (Team Death Match), FFA (Free For All Death Match), Control Point (Capture and Hold Controls Points), King of the Hill (One team, or player must defend a single Control Point to win), and Payload (a team must push their bomb to the enemy base in order to win). Graphics are cartoonish. Gameplay is very well done, and holy crap is it fun. Bugs almost nonexistent. Hat Simulator 2  II Gameplay The maps in the game are near perfectly balanced, not giving any team any type of real heads up. There are plenty of weapons, and cosmetics to choose from. It is considered that the default weapons are the best weapons, but each is entitled to their own opinions. There are a large number of maps, and a large number of other content available to the players. There are many items in the game that were created by the community itself, including maps, weapons, and cosmetics. Choosing random game modes/maps will always give you a different map every time (after 40ish hours you might have seen every map rotation), weapons can be earned through achievements, or by purchasing their variants through the market place. Valve does give you an option to switch to their beta maps as well, which of course are being tested by the players who choose to do so. The gameplay is fast paced and very logically developed, and due to its cartoonish graphical style it is very much enjoyable.  III Free to Play Vs. Paid to Play The game is indeed Free to Play, but if you receive any item drops, you are unable to use them/sell them. Unless of course you purchase an item from the Team Fortress 2 website, or from the MarketPlace. Purchasing an item gives you many more slots in your backpack for items, and removes all restrictions of Free to Play.  All in all a 10/10 game. You should be playing this right now."
"I reccomend this game. It's free.  Plus it's fun. Lots and lots of fun. Seriously, it's really fun. Believe me when I say this.  Are you bad at videogames? You can be good at this one. Possibly the only multiplayer game with built in aimbots. Just choose the Engineer class and build a sentry.   Do you like OP one hit kills? TF2 is the game for you. Go sniper or spy and headshot or backstab all the baddies. They'll hate you for it, but really- do you care? No. If you do, you probably shouldn't be playing a game with guns in it.  If you don't care and you like aimbots, don't cheat in other games. Play TF2 instead, because here it's allowed."
"An Awesome game, once you get in you might get bored for a min and then when you get into the game you wont stop playing, for the fact that TF2 is one of the best games out there. In TF2 you can play competetively with other people, or play an organized team with your friends, or puting on a hat or shirts on your characters (class).  I recomend this game for everybody who wants something to fill up they boring life"
"It's a good game, hit registration is kinda BS."
Amazing game highly addictive 10/10
A very good game.
"Great game 10/10 Has lots of weapons, an overdose of hats, and alot of fun mini games and friends to meet!!!!!!! :D Keep up the work valve OH, and lots of updates"
Best free to play game forever!!!
Pretty good game but gets abit boring when you play 80 hours+
Just a awesome cartoon free to play game!!!!!  ('thinks about hats')
It's fun.
Best game ever (thats free to play)
Im addicted to this game! I just got TF2 a couple of months ago and I already have 340 hours. I am in a UGC highlander team and I look forward to the season!
Team Fortress 2 is Awesome So Amazing I only Wish is if Steam could give me all hats and miscs or items xD pls .. But Still This Game IS AWESOME!!
"I just love this game, I'd recommend it to whoever can't aim, likes to snipe from spawn all day, humiliation, hats and/or conga. Have a nice day but remember. I'm better than you cause I've got hats."
"Team Fortress 2 is one of those games you mean to play for half an hour and end up staying for a couple hours. It is loaded with fun game modes, maps, and weapons. It is a team game so be ready to be a team player. The TF2 community has a lot to offer. Plus there are hats. And you know. Those are cool."
its pretty fun and you should play it
this is a really fun and interresting game. Play with friends for a better experience
This is a great game. I would give it a 10/10.
"At first this game may just seem like a not serious, cartoony mess. But if you actually download and play it for a while, youll start to realize how much there is to this game. TF2 really isnt like any other fps you find out there. May it be Battlefield, Call of Duty or Counterstrike. There are 9 different classes to choose from here (Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy), each one with completely different weapons and playstyles. Yes, even W+M1 is a playstyle (youll start to figure out this part if you play the game).   The Scout has high mobility due to his runspeed of 133% and ability of doing doublejumps, can dish out high damage really quickly (if played correctly) but doesnt have a lot of health. The Spy can disguise as enemy players and get a one-hit-kill with his backstab if they arent paying attention (or the pings of the other players are in their favour). His revolver is very powerful if aimed right and works just fine if you missed your backstab. The engineer can build 3 different buildings: The sentry gun, which is a very strong aimbot turret; the dispenser which gives health and ammunition to teammates, and the teleporter which, as you could imagine, teleports teammates from one place to another. His biggest concerns are spies (who can sap his buildings), demomen (who can blow up his buildings), and medics (who can charge the so called 'über', that gives 10 seconds of invulnerability to him and whoever he's healing). But if your teammates are helping you and you can aim somewhat well, these classes wont be to much of a problem.    The last point is about the f2p-model and the leveling. In Tf2, every single weapon has a downside and an upside (actually: there are a few weapons which dont have any stats and there are some weapons which have one minor upside). There arent any direct upgrades to weapons, like in call of duty (or 65% of all first person shooters for that matter). The only bonus that a player who has played longer than a beginner have is experience. So there arent any 'booster packs' for real money or stuff like that. 'Well then how does valve make money with this game????' you might ask. Yeah, there are crates that contain cosmetics.   One key to open one crate is 1,89 euros (STOP RIGHT THERE: as of april 2015, one key costs 2,29 euros. WTF VALVE). And that is how valve makes money off of the players. So, after this freaking long review, you better download Team Fortress 2 right now, or ill be using minisentries.   bye"
Fell off cliff to conga line 10/10
if you play cod go away because this game is 2 cool 4 u
"Pros  -Tons of customization  -Each class has different gameplay styles and their own personalities  -There's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of servers to play on  -Balanced gameplay  -Free to play   Cons  -F2P vs P2P war -_-    Team Fortress is an team game. If you want to have some fun or if your wallet is empty, download this game right now!!! 9/10"
Man this game is AWESOME play it if you are man or girl i don't know lol
it is a great game if you dont have it you should get it it is simply amazing. Most of all you just have a great time with your mates. Being different classes and helping your team out.
it is an amazing first person shooter
Classic crackhead fun
Come spend ALL of your money on virtual hats you'll never own in real life! :D
"DEN OUTA DEN is what i would say. But i just did. Anyway, Tf2 is a good game, aside with being a ghost trap only with my money, it is fun. If you want to download, let me give you a tip. DONT WEAR THE GHASTLY GIBUS. If someone sees you with that they will make fun of you. It happened to me and I don't want it happening to you. Anyway, get it."
"Team Fortress 2 has changed the way I view online gaming. Its so fun, and basically stress free ! I love the community, and every game you play makes you feel that you achieved something. Endless fun for hours and hours.  AND ITS FREE !!! Can you believe that ?  Definitely worth it.   Enjoy :D"
Team Forteress 2 is a really good game in terms of team play: Hence the name. It requires skill in certain areas and sometimes requires use of the lone wolf tactic.  Overall this is a REALLY fun game. 9/10
Behold the greatest hat / dress up simulator in the world!
"TF2 is one of my favorites there is so much fun to be had in this game, also great community, trading, and other stuff. so different from alot of shooters out there, tf2 has personality, its's VERY unique and i love all the sandwiches and STUFF too!! plus its free to play so more fun to have!"
Hats. Enough said.
Tf2.....this game cured me of Cancer and it has hats. MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING HATS~
"This is definetly my favourite FPS.It has great graphics, the best and most balanced weapons I've seen in FPS and most importantly a ton of Hats you can Find(if premium),Craft,Trade etc. .It has a great class-system which is also perfectly balanced (if used right :D) also a Must-Play... 80/100"
Would be the worst game if it werent for my W key and Mouse 1 Button. 3/Half Life 3
This is one of the best Free To Play games!
Great game and have never gotten bored... So many different way to play it :D
"Boom headshot . Bonk ! MMMMHHHPVV! SANDVICH! Oh , if iz wazzent a man i waz a kisz ya....  A few phrases to discribe Team fortress 2.  Honestly one of the best games ever. "

Well played Valve Good FPS game and plus its Free to Play i love :0
This game ♥♥♥♥ing suck you need premium to do eveyhing on this game if you dont have premium after downloading you mite kill yourself
"I have only played this for 2 hours, but it is one of the funnest games i have ever played :)"
"This is a very fun Free to Play online FPS game, I recommend playing it and hopefully we will get some more content added in the future!"
"&gt; I was only 10 years old. &gt; I loved TF2 so much, I had almost all the weapons I wanted. &gt; I would leave my computer on for hours, Just to get a few drops. &gt; Then I got my first hat, The gibus. &gt; Suddenly everything changed. &gt; I no longer cared about playing for fun, I only cared about the 'hats' &gt; I 'borrowed' my mommys credit card and bought more hats. &gt; I had so many hats, I loved them all. &gt; But then someone traded me, I accepted. &gt; They offered an Unusual for all my hats. &gt; It was so sexy looking, I put up all my hats and traded. &gt; But no Unusual, He scammed me. &gt; I lost it all. &gt; I was so sad I cried for hours. &gt; Later that night I prayed to Gaben for my hats back. &gt; I went to bed after praying. &gt; I felt warm. &gt; I looked behind me, It was Gaben! &gt; He said 'This is Gabe Newell' and handed me a Burning Team Captain. &gt; Then I woke up, I was wearing my Burning Team Captain and I was naked. &gt; I saw Gabe leave through the window, he looked back at me and winked. &gt; Hats are love. Hats are life.   TF2: 11/10 Best hat simulator 1981  Overall, I'd give this game 9 out of 10 Gabe Narwalls"
"This is one of the best games I've ever played (besides Halo) and I just want to say that I love it a lot. (You can tell by my hours lol) It's true, this game is basically only hats and cosmetics, but I think you could really have a lot of fun on this game. Look at every review, I'll bet you they're ALL positive. This is the best F2P game on steam, so go ahead, get it for yourself all of you noobs out there. Buy some hats (no really don't, this game will clean out your wallet), kill a lot of people! An lastly, get a gibus and wear it on your head with a smile."
"Team Fortress 2 is an amazing game, I have played it for so long and I still love playing it no matter how long I play it for. It's a really good game I recommend it."
Most likely the best game there is. It's free and incredibly well rounded with active support. Available on all platforms. Amazingly well suited for both casual and hardcore gamers. Valve chose the perfect game to offer for free. It's great for anyone.
Seriously the best FPS I have ever played.
BEST F2P GAME THERE IS!
Its a very fun game because you gwt to do fun things like take pictures have diffrent weird guns and you have 9 classes like Scout solider pyro medic and spy im not gonna spoil the rest have fun if you get the game!
"This next part I don’t remember so hot. All I know is I got up from the bed, like I was going down to the can or something, and then I tried to sock him, with all my might, right smack in the toothbrush, so it would split his goddam throat open. Only, I missed. I didn’t connect. All I did was sort of get him on the side of the head or something. It probably hurt him a little bit, but not as much as I wanted. It probably would’ve hurt him a lot, but I did it with my right hand, and I can’t make a good fist with that hand. On account of that injury I told you about."
"This is THE BEST free game on Steam. Hell, it's one of the best games of all time. You have no excuse to not play this game."
This game is okay
This game is good. That's all.
"As Steam's Flagship game, this game is one of the most fun games I have ever played. I play many FPS games, and most of them are serious. But I like games like TF2 that are not that serious, and in fact, hilarious."
"Once you find a server that fits well with your skill level, appropriate ratio of seriousness to humor, and is generally free of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, I've found TF2 to be one of the most enjoyable ways you can spend your time. Luckily, TF2's community is exceptional compared to other FPSs out there, so this generally isn't difficult. I do want to stress, however, how much server jumping can improve your experience if your first few tries aren't stellar. Lots of people play this game for lots of different reasons, so shop around and find a like-minded community. Whether you're super serious or just wanna conga or somewhere in between, who you play with affects your experience hugely."
"  Accidentally left it running, but the games okay I guess. "
10/10 'meh' ~ Duh Mass  You will get this game You will be called F2P You will pay for game  You buy from Mann Co You start a trading business You get many hats  Your hats are many You get first unusual You get pro killstreak  This is the cycle You will play part in game Praise Gaben and hats
"It's... BEST GAME EVER  It does not cost $400,000 to play this game for twelve seconds, so PLAY IT NAO"
"It starts off as a simple first person shooter.... Then the hars come. Hats, Keys and Stranges. This game will drain your bank account and destroy your social life."
Pretty Good
THE BEST GAME EVER!! YOU HAVE TO TRY IT!!
"Casual/competitive mode is alright I guess, but what REALLY bugs me the most is when I wait for about 5-7 minutes to join a game, then the game is over RIGHT when I started, not having much fun.... This has been happening for almost 5 games in a row so far."
"Why do you need this review? This game is free! Play it! One of the best FPSs I've ever had the pleasure of playing! Even if you don't like it, its free! So whats are the risks?"
first of all this game is free highly addictive and funny co op play
The best F2P game that you enjoy spending money on.  10/10
"Great game,love it thx to Gaben haha :)"
"Amazingly fun, addictive, and rage inducing. Also free!"
"Awesome game, it's even free. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
"Highly addicting game that doesn't get boring with the different characters and items up for grabs. The various classes have such charming personalities. Mixing and matching the classes to form a team is always fun. You can be unique with your classes by changing up their gear, something that compels me to continue playing."
this game is cool
this game is da best not big soup rice
I THINK THIS IS A PRETY FUN GAME I RECOMMED THIS GAME
+1 Would recommend
"The new update takes away player choice. People who wanted a game mode somewhat similar to competitive is happy, with the addition of 'Casual' and 'Competitive' modes. However casual mode can take ~10-20 minutes to find a game for you. ~~You can chose the game type, but you can't chose your map.~~ You can't jump from map to map like in the past. All the pubs are gone.  edit: they also took away the option of changing the FOV.  ~~edit: Oh yeah, you can't votekick anybody. So cheaters can stay on the map, and you can't do anything about it.~~"
"Team Fortress 2 has been out since 2007 and is still able to provide entertainment to many players. Its unique art style and interesting characters keep you playing and wanting more. It's always pleasing to go on a killstreak or to dominate a player on the enemy team. The newest 'Gun Mettle' update added a variety of new content to the game, like skins and contracts. Hopefully Valve can further extend the life time of this game even further with constant updates. Potential optimisation is something I really look forward to. I r8 8/8 m8."
"Team Fortress 2 has been one of my finest gaming experiences ever.  I've played many multiplayer games over the years and I must say TF2 has proven to be one of the most innovative and constantly changing (for the better) title I've ever dealt with.  Though I'll keep this short I will comment that every class feels unique and every character organic; with a playstyle and personality that each can call their own. This is perhaps my main drawing point to the series as their are few thinks more fun then dominating your enemies while your Demoman slurs drunkenly about the battlefield with a sword and decapitates a Heavy with a Minigun.  In all my time playing this game the experience has never diminished and I hold high hopes for the future of this game,"
One of the the most bloodthirsty cartoon games ever 10 out of 10
"The best Multiplayer out there since 2007 and now thats its FREE,Well you can't miss it buddy...  9/10 solid for me"
"Its fun for a couple of hours, then it gets boring."
Great game with a variety of weapons and cosmetics.
"One of the best free to play games (if not the best) and thats why it survived from 2007. Also the game has a lot of players and servers, which they are not laggy and full of players. The 9 characters the game has, are based on different 'powers' and the gameplay is different between them.  I recommend this game for everybody who loves multiplayer and fps games."
Fun game with a variaty of classes and while not battling do some trading.But overall really addicting game.
"Fashion Fortress 2, the world's﻿ greatest war-themed hat simulator "
"This game is really fun because of the gun mettle update that lately came out. This update is amazing all weapons are balanced. Team Fortress 2 is not pay to win but I would recommend buying something from the store so you can get rare items a bit more easily but only if you enjoy it, now excuse me and let me play more of this amazing online shooter."
World's best hat simulator. 10/10
"It's a great game.   Awesome graphics, awesome gameplay. All out, it's balanced, too.  The better you get at it, the more fun it gets, and the more things you can do, too.  Try it out."
I think it's a wonderful game highly recommended and pretty addicating.
It's awesome
Amazing FPS Game! And also its FREE!!! (What Else Do You Need) 
ALERT ALERT YOU MUST READ THIS NOW UNLESS YOU KNOW ABOUT PHISHING A man named Turtle added me so I accepted but he wanted to trade using A DIFFERENT WEBSITE SO I thought of it as phishing or as a scam so I denied it and UNFRIENDED OR BLOCK so if a person adds and you says''Trade me but I can't so go to this website so I can trade you''.

"One of the Greatest Games Ever Made. An FPS that is like no other FPS you have ever played, or you will ever play. And if you have a steam account, you have to play TF2 at least once. It's an initiation. It has a relatively shallow learning curve and is friendly to players of all skill levels.  The first match I ever played on were on Skial servers... and I didn't get THAT torn apart. But trust me, scrub or superb, this game has a place for you.  But it is not for the faint hearted...  Nah, that is incorrect.  If you are god awful at Call of Duty, then play this game; you will be good. If you are an M.L.G. Pro level C.o.D. player, stay away. This game will blow your mind with all its non-fps-like nuances.  I recommend this game with the all my heart... what ever is left of it after... 'And that is how I lost my medical license!!!'  -Future Soldier, signing off"
"1 word to describe this game, awesomeness."
"Very great game, amazing community, funny players, and overall wonderful atmosphere."
Has hats. and guns. 10/10.
One of the best games ever made. And it's free - can you believe it? Van Gaal can't.
"An engineer wrenched me to death, I cried all night  10/10 I love it"
this game is one of the best FPS tha I have play
It's amazing. I don't even need to say anything. Get it. Now. I SAID NOW.
10/10 ruined my life need hats
"At this state, it's more enjoyable to tickle a polar bear's balls, than trying to play on the ''Casual'' mode."
"Well the game has it's flaws, but it's is by far better then most other multiplayer shooters on the market right now and in the not so distant past.  Best trading-hat-game out there :D"
Best free to play multiplayer game in the world :) !!!!!!!
This game gave me cancer.
10/10
This game is so fun if you get very angry take your anger out on players and bots its fun and its greate when you play with your friends. Plus you can also trade with your friends with some items it so cool and fun. XD
"I like this game because of the individual possibility of doing whatever you want. The freedom of doing this is awesome because you can just laugh your socks off at free to play falling off a Cliff, or a hoovey offering free sandwiches in the middle of a battle. The possible individuality is what makes this game so golden."
man I really love this new overwatch game by blizzard they really outdone themselves!!
  the best fps of all time
I use a fish to kill a Russian eating raw meat and an Australian throwing ♥♥♥♥ everywhere. 10/10
"One of the best games I've ever had. Got my steam account just so I could play it, ever since I saw my friend having so much fun with it."
"It was just a game to kick back and relax with friends, that's still an option on community run servers but it's become a competitive mess. Core of the game has died. If you still want the same feeling of the old Tf2, I suggest you look for another game. If you're a die hard fan, well I guess you will just have to carry on, good luck soldier ;) Game is mostly free, so give it a try...you never know."
"Best game on Steam so far... very funny, enjoyable, and so colorful to play. I recommend everyone to try it."
Great game and its even free :)!
"This is the classic, TFC gameplay, updated with hats. And then other misc. items. And now even the classic weapons have been redone to look like bread with teeth. You heard me.  As ridiculous as this game seems, the gameplay is still one of the best. Its a balanced shooter with multiple gameplay modes and 9 different unique classes. If the gameplay doesn't capture you, the trading will. Be careful. I recall a time when I spent more time trading than I did actually playing....  Graphics: 9/10 Sound: 10/10 Gameplay: 10/10  Overall: 9.5/10"
GABE BBY THANKS FOR THE AUSSIE MVM SERVERS
"This is an updated review, as of 2016 valve has unbalanced most of the classes making it almost 100% luck based to play, the weapons have been ♥♥♥♥♥ed on and skins have been added. Valve has realized they can just make mone with out fixing their broken game.  The only reason a I recommend this [8 gig] game is so you can see for your self."
Team Hatress 2
"Really good game for a free to play and is very fun, runs well even on very cheap computers. Over all is a perfect game to get when you start on steam."
I would never wish upon my greatest enemy death by crockets.
"Team Fortress 2. One of my favorite games. Destroyed by the new update Valve releaseed. I just have one question Valve... Why? Why turn TF2 into CS:GO. I paid for CS:GO, to play CS:GO. I bought premium on TF2, to play TF2, not CS:GO. Change it back to its old form please. If they do, I recommend this game. If not, avoid this game at all costs.  -DemonicPlayZ"
good game . I need more HAT !
"One of the greatest FPSs I've ever played! Maps and game modes are all varied and fun to play with a graphics style that still manages to look great even after 6+ years. The amount of weapons and aesthetic items is mind boggeling, mixed with amazing gameplay, the game manages to stay enganging and entertaining 600+ hours in. This game is a serious must have for any Steam user! Also, hats."
"TF2 was one of my favorite games of all time, but the recent update really killed the gameplay.  1. You can't choose your own maps anymore in the various game modes. You get what you get. 2. It should not take 15+ minutes to enter a casual game when it only took less than 3 minutes before. 3. If you exit in the middle of a CASUAL game, you get penalized with a cooldown preventing you from entering another game.  Fix this, Valve."
"If you are flat broke and can't buy CS:GO and still wanna use your steam and play a multiplayer game, then this is the game for you!"
"TF2 is amazing. It is simply a must-have game on Steam. If you don't have it, get it today!"
"tf2 in a nutshell : CHAOS, TACTIC, HD"
"I was playing this game, and then I was like '♥♥♥♥! I gotta masturbate!' Luckily, there was enough porn sprays on the walls to feed all of Nigeria my ♥♥♥♥♥.   9/11 It was decent"
Team Fortress 2 is the best Multplayer game Valve ever created MUST PLAY!!!
Spent all my money on virtual hats...     10/10
"Hey children you can fly by detonating explovsives under your feet, HF!!!"
Meet the match completly ruined casual play. i cant play my favorite map and gamemode anymore becaus i get thrown in servers with my most hated maps. Plus the waiting time takes like half a day. THANKS GUYS
it's a fun game for people that don't want to spend money on gemes
Great game never gets old trading items and weapons is surprisingly fun and the gameplay is always fun.
"Very fun, as soon as you get advanced into the game the cosmetics hats and stranges take over you mind set and make you want to look the smexiest you could ever be in a videgame    10/10"
One of the best fps games out there. 10/10 
I like MVM the most and im playin nightmare and its cool VERY VERY cool
Skills don't matter as long as you got fancy hats to show off.
I thought i had no life until i saw them other reviews
"This is one of the finest hat-themed simulators around. You'd be hard pressed to find a better game with such a vast amount of fashionable headwear! I came for the hats, and I stayed for the hats: something that can't be said about many other video games. Look no further: don your derby, show off your chapeau, and kick ♥♥♥ and take names while wearing your toque on Team Fortress 2!"
"Classic, but still a lot of fun - even if it went down to 'Team Marketplace' recently."

"Team Fortress 2 has to be my favourite game. It has variety, with nine very different classes, a huge range of strange and very entertaining weapons and a decent amount of gamemodes, ranging from melee-only Medieval mode to the classic Control Points and Payload modes. It also recieves regular, if a little hat-obsessed, updates from Valve with things like new maps, weapons and cosmetics (your wallet's worst enemy). This combined with events such as Halloween, Smissmas and TF2's own birthday amounts to a hugely diverse shooter.   I've noticed a lot of complaints about the amount of cosmetics and other items that require the spending of real money (stranges, Mann Up rewards, taunts, etc.) entering TF2 lately. But these aren't really game-changing at all. All are purely for looks (any new weapons can be found in a drop, crafted or traded for), making TF2 not pay2win at all. Not many F2P games can make that claim, so we should be grateful that (for now) Valve are not making us pay obscene amounts of cash to have a good time.  All in all, you should give this game a go. Even if you are terrible at FPS games (like me) and have a pretty low-grade PC (also like me) I really do urge you to try it out. Chances are you will not regret it.  And remember: The Gibus is not an indication of skill. It just means the player was sensible enough to not spend their money on virtual attire."
"A fresh take on the first-person shooter which also happens to be Free-to-Play. This game WILL destroy your social life with it's cartoonish humor, humorous and deadly weapons, and the vast amount of custom content available. Seriously, you can kill someone with a whip, fish, and a frying pan."
this game never end..... with trading system and many fun things..... great game !!!
Hats...10/10 would wear again.
"Team Fortress 2 is a class-based FPS. You can play as the Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy. All the classes have own, unique forms of gameplay that you can't achieve in other shooters, Every class has their own strategies, weapons, and tricks! There is more by adding cosmetics and taunts to make your classes look different and that adds spice to the gameplay. Even though I think TF2 is an amazing game, it has its flaws. Their are many bugs, glitches, and exploits that, for me, stop the current game at a screeching halt. Besides that, the game is perfect in my eyes! I give this game a 9.5/10."
Fantastic hat simulator.
Best game ever on glitchy things and being a pro 
Very Nice.
Get steam Download tf2 Get weapons buy premium get more weapons trade  shark people sell items in the market get money buy other games ??? profit
"ridiculously addicting. the game is 6 years old, and is still updated regularly with new content, thats not something you see everyday. if you have not played this at all, get out of that hole you're sitting in and play it!"
its ok   i mean its not like i dropped 200 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars and over 1500 hours on it  not at all
Everything good about this game as already been said but regardless it's a good game has guns n' classes. This game you could be a team player or a lone wolf and theres a class for each and anyones play style but best to test each class for yourself.  One problem is the outrageous prices for stuff just to find out it's alot less than what you traded for so if your not being ripped off by a player your just supplying Valve with more money than they need. Overall is amazing and the custom maps and gamemodes not to mention skins and sounds you can mod in makes the game all the more enjoyable.

This is the most glorious game in the history of mankind and beyond. It is a MUST get if you already don't have it. AND IT'S COMPLETELY FREE! So stop playing your Call of Duty and play something that will make you want more and more and MORE.
I spend too much time on this game and EOTL was terrible 10/10- IGN

The game where you not play yet you trade The silliest multiplayer fps shooter game you can find :D
"Very addicting and fast pace, with helpful players that will guide you through everything, but tryhards that keep you raging for hours. I would give this game an 8.5 out of 10. It has a great community that will keep it popular for years."
This is one of the funnest games i have ever played thx steam

"This competitive mode is a joke. It just takes random rank people and match them, thats it. 50% of the time someone leave the match, other 50% - hope for the best...  I think this valve's money miling machine need to be seriously fixed or just forgotten."
"Being upfront about this game is about as hard as a baloney sandwich. Nine classes, 3 base or 'stock' weapons each, (unincluding the spy and engineer classes) with multiple abilities and different playstyles for each.  That was the base game.  Being upfront about this game now is about as hard as wrestling a polar bear with a machine gun strapped to its back in zero gravity. Same nine classes, same stock weapons. But due to updates, content additions and big roll-outs of weapons and hats, this game has changed unbelieveably. Now with new weapons for every class with all new statistics and abilities, strange-teir weapons, vintage-teir weapons, genuine-teir weapons, collector-teir weapons, strangifies, chemistry sets, killstreak kits and fabricators, unusual hats, australium weapons, keys, refined metal- you get it. There's a lot to take in. Team Fortress 2 even has it's own economey that functions similarly to real life ones. But after you learn about it, the game is truly a gem. Hundreds of gamemodes both company and community made, thousands of servers, thousands of maps- there's still a lot to take in. Playing well, developing a strategy, finding new friends and groups- still not done. Trading and finding new items to have, hats to wear, modifiers for your favorite weapons, and much more. If you'd like a quirky, challenging game with thousands of things to do, you're in luck, as Team Fortress 2 has it. If you'd like a serious, hardcore game with clans to join and other clans and groups to beat- you're still in luck, because Team Fortress 2 has that as well.  Now stop reading! Go get the game!  (p.s. it's free.)  10/10"
"Team Fortress 2 is a team-based, first-person shooter multiplayer computer game developed by valve. It is the successful sequel to Tream Fortress Classic. It first came out in a compilation called The Orange Box, which is no longer avaliable. As of 2011, Team Fortress 2 is a free to play game, where you can upgrade to premium via purchasing something from the Team Fortress 2 in-game store.  Gameplay:  This fun game is based on two oppisite teams, Builders League United, often refered to as BLU team. And RED team, Reliable Excavation and Demolition. Players can choose to play as one of the nine character classes in these teams each with their own unique strenghts, weaknesses and weapons. Each class consist of a primary weapon, a secondary weapon, and a melee weapon. Although certain classes contain PDA's and other unique items. Team Fortress 2 was released with six offical maps, but many more maps have been added. A neat little addition to this game is 'The Administrator' a woman announces different game events over PA or Loudspeaker, so that everyone in the game can hear it. Stats are a extreamly nice addition to this game, where time played as a certain class, most kills as that class and most objectives achived in that life, etc...  Game Modes: -In Capture the Flag maps, the objective for both teams is to obtain a briefcase of intelligence from the enemy team's base and return it to their own base while preventing the opposing team from doing the same. The player carrying the intelligence can be killed to drop the briefcase, or the player can willingly drop it; in either case this starts a brief timer. A team can only score by delivering the enemy's intelligence to their base. A match lasts until one team scores a set number of points or time runs out. A variant of Capture the Flag, called Special Delivery, has teams vying over a single briefcase to attempt to deliver to a common target. Once the intelligence is picked up by one team, only members of that team can carry it until either it successfully delivered, or the drop timer expires and it is returned to its original spawn point.   -Control Point modes are more varied in their objectives, but share the common aim of capturing a particular point on the map by having one or more team members stay on the point without the presence of the opposing team for a short period of time. In standard control point maps, each team already controls an equal number of points, with one additional point left unclaimed; teams can only attempt to capture points that are nearest to those points they already control. Each team attempts to progressively capture all the control points to win the round. In attack/defend-style maps, the RED team already controls all the points on the map, and must hold these points from being captured by the opposing team (BLU Team) for a length of time. Attack/defend-style maps can come in either single-round or multiple-round maps; Rounds past the first will only be played if BLU wins a round.  -Territorial control is a more complex version of Control Point, in which each map is divided into a number of closed sections, held between the two teams. Each round has one team attempting to seize control of the opposing team's capture point for that section in a fixed amount of time. Once a team holds all but the enemy's home base point, they then attempt to capture the enemy base point while the enemy defends for a fixed amount of time.  -King of the Hill features a single control point in the center of the map, with teams vying for control over it. The control point is locked for a set amount of time after the round start. Once the point is unlocked, either team can capture it. Capturing the control point starts the team's clock counting down. The clock that is currently counting down will only stop if the other team captures the point, the clock reaches 0:00, or another map-specific event occurs such as a Halloween boss spawning during the Halloween event. Teams win the round when their clock reaches 0:00 with the control point currently under their control. If the other team is capturing the point, the round will not end until the point's capture progress resets to 0.  -Payload maps feature a length of track atop which sits a bomb mounted on a cart. These maps come in two varieties. In normal Payload maps, one team must escort the cart through a series of checkpoints in a limited amount of time to reach a final target that the other team defends. The cart moves when one or more players of the team are near it without enemies nearby; during this, the cart heals and provides ammo to those close by. If no one is by the cart, it may move backwards towards the last checkpoint, or roll off uphill sections of the track. In Payload Races, both teams race to deliver a bomb-cart to a final target; there are no checkpoints and unmanned carts will not move in reverse, but still require team members nearby to fully complete uphill sections. Both types of Payload maps can come in single-round or multiple-round maps. In standard payload, further rounds will only be played if BLU wins. In Payload Race, all rounds will be played regardless of which team wins, but the winner of previous rounds starts with their cart farther up the track.  -Arena is a team deathmatch mode, typically occurring smaller environments featuring a single control point. In each round, players do not respawn on death; a team wins the round by capturing the control point or eliminating all of the other team members.  -Medieval mode can be played on maps dedicated to this mode, or enabled for any other mode type. This mode forces players to use melee or similar medieval weapons.  -MvM - Mann vs. Machine - is a six player co-operative mode where the mercenaries are defending a structure against increasingly difficult waves of robots. Players have the ability to buy upgrades and improvements between rounds using in-game money earned during previous waves. A 'Mann Up' version is available by purchasing tickets with real money to participate in larger events on official servers with the opportunity to win unique cosmetic items after successfully completing a Tour of Duty.   If you decided to read this far in, thank-you for reading. :)"
"A breathe of fresh air on a rainy afternoon. It's like running through the dessert, then tripping and falling only to land in the body of water called TF2. A game that defies the need for perfect graphics and visuals to be 'good.' It is almost as if God himself (should he exist) reached down and coded with his 7 hands this amazing game. I find myself being able to play multiple (3) matches before getting bored. Its like I just can't get enough. You remember that day when you were less than a year old? Yeah that day. Smiles all the time and little puffs of cheddar goodness. That is life now. Replace those gerber cheddar puffs with Cheeto cheese puffs and you're the same kid all over again. Interacting with your cartoon entertainment on a saturday morning, shooting a holes in the face like the kid you are. Lets face it, America's youth is troubled. All kids want to shoot people in the face. Can you blame them? Look at the world we live in. I tell you what we need. A revolution of baby shooters practicing on TF2 to take back America. Restore it to the constitutional ways of Abraham Lincoln (before he slayed vampires). Bring back the values of our founding fathers. Or Germany's founding fathers would be fine too. That kill all the Jews thing. I love my mod on Left For Dead 2 where all the Zombies are Jews and the survivors are Nazis. Thats some real life shiz right there. Have you ever had chocolate cake you didn't like? EXACTLY! So play this game."
Doing this to get exp but this game is fun and amzing in its own way a must ply and own for yourself and friends.
awesome game to play with people and you can customise your loadouts and classes :D
Ruined my life and cost me over 150 Pounds. I suggest you download it.
"This is a fantastic game for just about everyone. Considering it is free, you can enjoy it without spending all your dough."
One of my favorite games on Steam.
A fantastic hat-swapping simulator for classy gentlemen/gentleladies.
come on do i really need to say anything
The BEST Free To Play ever
"This game is the reason I wanted to make a youtube account and the reason I have friends, I love this game, hats, cosmetics, weapons, and more! In my search to find my favroite game this has been the most sucessful, also I have put OVER 1 THOUSAND HOURS INTO THIS GAME (I admit I'm addicted)."
"Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is a very special game, as proven by its abnormally long lifespan as a F2P FPS. I can say with all honestly that it is my favorite shooter, and probably my favorite game overall. Although it probably goes against Valve's intention, they have created a game so enthralling that players don't really need to go buy anything else on Steam.   TF2 has 9 different classes to choose, each with its own unique playstyles and subsets of playstyles within each class. This isn't like other fps where you just switch out different weapons and they call it a new 'class'; each class in TF2 has different sizes, hitboxes, movement speeds, damage vulnerablilites, weapon synergies. Part of the reason I believe TF2 has lived for so long as one of the top-played games on Steam is because of the variation in classes and playstyles. Even people who perform poorly in traditional fps games such as COD or CS:GO are able to enjoy TF2 because of the option to play classes that may play more to their strengths like engineer, medic, or pyro. Whether you enjoy being a sneaky flanker like spy or scout or you're more of a soldier on the front lines, there's something for everyone.  There are plenty of gamemodes with different objectives to play, the most popular being payload, 5cp, and koth. Payload is so extremely popular that Blizzard pretty much straight-up copied and pasted it into Overwatch. Payload is a mode where you must push a cart down a set of tracks across the map while the enemy team does everything in their power to stop you. Again, I should stress that even if you are not good at traditional shooters, you can still be an asset to your team by helping to play the objective. TF2 differes from other shooters in that the goal is not necessarily to KILL the enemy team; you must simply complete the objective. I cannot tell you how many times a team with worse talent and ability was able to rein triumphant because they simply focused on the objective better.  Most famously of all, though, is TF2's economy centered around the trade of hats and other cosmetic items. While critics have panned hats as the plague that killed TF2's original art style, they have certainly brought life to the community through the creation of new user-created items in the Workshop and the creation of an entire economy that utilizes both in-game currency (keys) and real-world money. One of the rarest hats in TF2, the Burning Team Captain, has been sold at a value of $20,000 USD. Hats are no joke.  For all the love I have for TF2, I cannot pretend it is not without a large number of problems. Many players (including myself) feel that Valve does not care about TF2's gameplay nearly as much as they do about crates, keys, and cosmetics because those items are what make Valve their money. As a result, TF2's updates have been progressively becoming more focused on introducing new cosmetics and less focused on introducing new viable weapons or bugfixes. Often times, it feels like Valve doesn't even know how their own game plays, as they will make major changes without listening to the community. Bugs that have existed for several YEARS (and I do mean years because that's how old this game is) are ignored so much that it seems like nobody at Valve even plays TF2. Obviously overpowered weapons have received buffs, underpowered classes nerfed, and simple changes that would make TF2 significantly better are rarely acted upon. As long as people keep buying keys, MvM tickets and other in-game items, Valve has little reason to improve upon one of their most popular and valuable IPs.  Funnily enough, I still recommend TF2 to everyone. I hope that Blizzard's major support for Overwatch will finally force Valve to start building momentum and focus on TF2's gameplay again."
10/10 would hat again
"If you're looking for something to play while you're waiting for Overwatch to come out, please, turn off your computer, get out of your seat, open your front door, and walk into oncoming automobile traffic.   Otherwise, welcome to Team Fortress 2 (AKA hat simulator 2k16)!  Here you'll find an excellent community, and many great members of said community.  If you don't know what to play class-wise, try heavy. I'm serious, we need more heavy.  P.S. ~ I RESEARCHED THE N.W.O. and CHEM TRAILS AND NOW THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO WIPE MY BRAIN USING OMEGA WAVES, VOTE JOHN KASICH 2016!!"
Nothing like TF2's cartoony mayhem. It has stood the test of time and continues to evolve.
"The Team Fortress 2 is still extremely amazing. Maybe it is as good because of those classes to play. Theres are 9 different Classes,with amazing weapons to collect. You will find your favourite class. It was the first game i WANTED to have a premium. And HEY,THE GAMEI S FOR FREE,i'm sure you won't find a better game for free. Just give it a try!"
Ive wasted so mutch time into the Game but id like to see a Reward drop for Wining/Loseing a match Mabe with Lowtier skins and or Contract skins exp. tartan torpedo and Rustic runier so then the flow of skins can come in and out.
Great Game
"love this game so much, this is such a well balanced game, there is no OP weapons cause there is always a anti weapon, and anti class for each character in this game,this game takes alot more skill then a run and gun game anyday,plus the game gives back to you when you play so its a win win :D"
"You see it involves dumb people, trains and giant octopus' that will bite off your head along with your gentials overall, those key features obviously make it a great game."
24/7 Lotusclan/Skial servers the game
"Great Game. Community maps, gameplay updates,   Would recommend"
"By far one of the games I've played the most, this is a MUST HAVE if you've got Steam and you like First Person Shooters. They're always adding new content and it always helps make the game feel fres, unless of course you're too busy trading the in game items to even play the game itself haha."
pretty good
"There's not a better Multiplayer game out there. This game is freakin' amazing. There isn't a person in the world that I would not recommend it too. The game gets frequent updates and is just filled to the brim with content. The gameplay is fun and fair (for the most part) Every class has a distinctive personality they makes them all unique to each other, which adds another layer to the game. If you're looking for endless hours of multiplayer AND FOR FREE, this truly is the game for you."
"One of the funnest games I've ever played  And it's completely free, there is not a single hint of it being a pay to win game, you don't find completely free games like this often, if at all. And the fact that it is an incredibly fleshed out game makes it all the better.  You're missing out if you haven't installed this game"
Awesome Game Download it It may take all day but itll pay off 
"1,200 hours and counting."
great game lots of fun and hilarious moments on the screen. over all i hope to be seeing more of this game in the future.
Awesome f2p FPS.
"Very good game, great animations and great fun. Would reccomend!"
9/10
1000 hours. All I need to say.
THIS GAME IS AMAZING 
"BONUS DUCKS. Thanks alot Engies, you made bread, then ducks came. WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY 8/8 m8 liek cumint zubzkrib. t8r tot m8  DUCK HYPE, QUACK"
"hats, guns, hats, effects for hats, clothes. good game  10 out of 10  something for everyone"
This game was F2P since it came out. F2P = Fun to Play
"Great game, lots of fun"
Very Fun - Non Stop Addiction to the Max
This is the very good game. 
That weird moment when i like the more for its gameplay instead of hats
10/10  Why cart is not moving :D Heavy &lt;3
more rad than a guy named Rad
"This game has taken the most time out of my life than any other game, for some really good reasons. TF2 has some really smooth and balanced gameplay along with HATS, can't forget the HATS. Anyway, I really would suggest this game to everyone and the fact that its free is AWESOME! If I had one suggestion is that make it so supply crate keys can be found, don't make it a frequent drop but make it a drop nonetheless. Besides that they really did it right with this game! 10/10."
"Team Fortress 2 is the best F2P game I have ever played. There are a bunch of different classes, 9 to be exact. The offense classes, the Scout, the Soldier and the Pyro, the defensive classes, the Demoman, the Heavy and the Engineer and the last the support classes, the Medic, the Sniper and the Spy. My top 3 favorite classes are the Spy, Scout and the Soldier. Go try it for yourself, there is much to explore in Team Fortress 2!"
This is my most favorite game' god job guys y'all keep up the good work!
"REALLY good game, More items being added. However, they could add them faster much like garrys mod adds mods every day or so, But other than that, RECOMMENDED!"
Awsome shooting and hats game :)
"I would highly recommend this game. It's addicting and has an awesome community. This is definetly the best free to play that I have ever played. Even if you are not the First Person Shooter kinda person, I would definetly give Team Fortress 2 a try!"
A nice game about hats. :^)
"Great graphics, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ players. Usually uptight and suck some major ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Other than that, fun maps, fun ♥♥♥♥, and fun killing. 10/10 would play it again"
Great game but don't let it steal your wallet ;-;
One word is needed to describe this game and one word only.  HATS.
"It's a fun, and cool game. You can always count on the netcode ;P"
A fun FPS shooter try it out peeps! 
The most fun you can have online - PC Gamer  They're right  -Yats
"Very Good game if want to mess about, but best thing to keep away from the jailbreak games 9 classes all diffrent ways to play them"
It's a good game. Get it! Don't then go jump into a river!
"The only game where you can play as a skinny teen beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of a black scottish cyclops using a giant fish  11/10 Hat simulator 2007  Would conga again  But seriously, if you don't have this yet, you're doing something wrong"
"I would like to start off, there are many ways of playing this game, my favourite is walking around with a 3$ hat and with a sandwich, good times."
"This first person shooter is unique to all others, it has a cartoony look and feel which is the core to how this game works. The weapon designs are all unique and humorous and the maps are excellent to play in."
This game is a phenomenon.
How does anyone put this game into one word?   Simple: Hats  Hat/Hat would hat again.
best game i love it you should play it if you like ffperson shooters.
I guess it's okay need more Game Time to give you a good Review.  
"I sat through the past updates withe the shameless cash grabbing in the gun mettle and tough break updates and I was fine because they didn’t mess with what made the game great, but the MYM update has gone too far with the complete removal of quick plays. I have a feeling that valve is trying to get more fans but in the process have alienated their own fans. I still play the game and have a little fun but it just doesn’t feel the same."
"I personally love playing this game when I'm bored, just to play on local servers and custom servers with friends to pass the time.  Each new update is like a new experience to me that i can encounter everytime new things are added into from other users and the Valve community as well.  Also, i do encounter some frame drops and rises on servers, but i know that's just my connection of my internet to that specific server.  But seriously this is a great game to play with friends online when bored or for events!"
I love this game it is my all time favourite game and i have nothing more to say other than PLAY IT! My rating 10/10 GET IT IT'S FREE
One of the BEST GAMES ever &lt;3
"Well well. Team Fortress 2 All I can say about this game is that the motto describes the game 'The most fun you can have online'  The Classes are balanced and unique with their personalities I mean u got: A Drunken Scottish Cyclops, A crazy German Doctor who gives no ♥♥♥♥s for his patients and a messed up American  SERIOUSLY how do Valve do it?  Gamemodes are unique and lets not forget what Team Fortress 2 is known for HATS and Taunts.  Now alot of people hate the Conga but some like it but the Conga is a way to liven up the mood of a game and just have fun besides the game is NOT just about killing its a way to enjoy your moments of free time  And of course Mann vs Machine a Co-op mode which forces the needs of 6 people to work together to fend off robots and earn loot (If you play Mann Up)  A game out for 7 years and soon coming to it's 8th year and still going strong and since when did Call of Duty have a game for 7 years and still going strong cause it's all like 'OMG New Call of Dooty must get omg improved graphics'  Since when did graphics change a review on a game it's about the GAMEPLAY that matters.  Team Fortress 2: A strong game after 7 Years.  (This is why I have over 2000 hours may be a Sweat but it's just much fun)"
"My god. What happened to this game? :( It used to be something that I could have fun on, but now it turned into CSGO, a game that has gotten boring for me :/ and it even didn't let me use sound..."
"Team fortress 2 was a very good game and the updates ♥♥♥♥ed it all up. Sure it had bugs and sure it had its problem but valve thought ♥♥♥♥ the fans, ♥♥♥♥ people who just want to play the game for fun. Once I saw the words competive it instantly reminded me of csgo. Hell the update just added things into tf2 from csgo. I loved this game but the update killed the fun and joy of it. It was like valve getting an axe and chopping the head off the game and replacing it with another head that doesn't even match.  Valve you ♥♥♥♥ed up a once good game. And I hope they listen and bring back the old game not this csgo ♥♥♥♥ because tf2 isn't like the toxic communtiy of csgo that bans you for sucking because competive mode and ♥♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥ the update and bring back tf2 . Because overwatch mighted be my next option."
Good game. But new update = no good. Waiting for Valvo to fix. Simply wait.... and wait.... wait....
Meet Your Match Update!  more like Meet Your Most Loved Game Fall Update!
"Hey valve before i start i just wanna say Tf 2 is my favourite game by far so im definatly recommending this game BUT i just dont like the way vavle has been treating it instead of dealing with stupid 9 year old sqeaker hackers vavle adds casual i was really shocked that vavle removed quickplay that was going fine and is so easy, they implement a stupid rank system, yes i dont have anything against competetive i quit enjoy competetive but casual srsly? theres no point please vavle fix it bring quickplay and pubs back, anyway back to the hackers its so easy to download this stupid virus filled program (im not saying the name) that as i said 9 year olds can get it but vavle people can hack much more clever you should be dealing with the stupid proplem i dont wanna get dominated by 9 year olds that havent even touched the mouse. Ok thats it with the problems Tf 2 is a great game and i recommend anyone to get it, its free to play and its soo addictive with the trading and unusuals that you can never get bored and the community is so strong i cant wait for frontline if you read this thanks for your time. "
11/10 Best hat simulator.
Fashion show with guns....what more can you ask for?  10/10.5
I used to like it
Good game but too large of a download. Quite steep learning curve if you want to be a good at any class - especially sniper.
"I may not have that many hours in tf2 but the new update makes me want to cry, literally. The old tf2 was a fun quirky game that had few rules and had no serious gameplay. Hightower was one of the most fun things in all of gameing, gone. I do get why this update was released, to compete with overwatch, but the way that valve did it was utterly discusting. Abandoning your core fanbase for a more overwatch like game was dissapointing at best. So do your part, don't buy from the man co store and give bad reviews. #MAKETF2GREATAGAIN"
I used to love this game...but with the most recent update 'Meet Your Match' this game has really gone down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Im sorry tf2 but you are basically dead
"Welp, this game got ♥♥♥♥ed up after the Meet Your Match update. Everyone wants the quickplay back, but seems like Valve doens't listen at all.  I used to like this game, but now it's just a big nope."
Can't recommend in its current state. Valve really dropped the ball with this MM update.
Well the game is good but the uptade sucks and all they did was start a war between pyro and heavy and not only that buff and debuff weapons and the loading times sucked and before you could not make a server and please don't join servers they only tell u to donate and give you adds also you have to download a bunch of unneeded things to play server maps and if they are ever nerfing nerf the pyro the game has all the items and weapons and the characters are funny and have humor also you will probly find this game addicting i know i did so i ended up buying things for the game it was worth it for 2 reasons you will get a man co cap and people won't call you a f2p i feel really bad for them but they are mostly little kids i went to a trade server to trade and there was 3 p2p and the rest 10 were f2p they didn't even want to trade but the p2p actually traded with me see the game is good fun and i recomend the saxton hale servers if you ever want to have fun on severs but the updates are ruining the game valve needs to work not be lazy and slack off while we get dissapointed but the servers go faster and heck you can even try weapons also if you get the ghostly or oringinal gibus and pyrovision goggles please DON'T WEAR IT just trust me this game i reccomend
This Game is Bae... ༼ ºل͟º ༼ ºل͟º ༼ ºل͟º ༽ ºل͟º ༽ ºل͟º ༽
Vallve look what hapend whit team fortress 2 this meet your match upadete is ♥♥♥♥
"Best f2p game out there, fun style and great design. Love the frequent updates and community involvement."
tf2 is a really fun game but ever since the new updates it has gone down i popularity i thu=ink if they dont start listining to the community bad things are going to happen that i really wish wont
tis game is good
"ATTENTION: If you're too lazy, then don't read this since it's really long. Now I'm not an old TF2 player (since I've only been playing for about 3 years), but I can tell like most of TF2 players that the game became sh**. Since the End of Line update, I've started to notice that TF2 started to get worse and worse by time. Let's talk about bad things that TF2 have been getting (in my opinion): 1- The End of Line Update: The update isn't bad, the problem is that around the time of that update a lot of TF2 players started to stop playing TF2. I can't really blame Valve or anyone for this, but I'm quite disappointed. 2- Cosmetics: Now before you go rage mode and claim that I'm too poor to afford cosmetics, I don't really mind the overwhelming amount of cosmetics being added, my problem is the fact that they're the community's main focus nowadays, no new weapons anymore, last time they added weapons was like back in 2014 (Iron Bomber and Quickiebomb Launcher for Demoman, and Panic Attack), I do realize 4 new weapons were added in 2015 (which no one heard of probably), but it's still bullsh**. 3- Weapons Skins: Hey the fans are quitting TF2 and are upset because there are no new weapons, what should we do? Oh that's right, let's add weapon skins that are completely useless! Yeah the fans will love that idea! :D 4- Weapons Changes: By far, the only weapon change I'm disappointed of is the Soda Popper (before: builds Hype by running around, now: builds Hype on hit), if I noticed another bad weapon change, I would be absolutly ♥♥♥♥♥♥. 5- Community Servers: I personally play community servers (mostly for instant respawn), but I noticed that community servers went from bad to complete trash. I don't think I have to explain how because it's obvious. 6- Meet Your Match Update: This is the straw that broke the camel's back for me, the previous things didn't stop me from enjoying the game, but this update is the reason why I now don't want to play TF2 anymore. Really? Casual mode? What the f**k happened to the quickplay feature? Sure I play community servers from time to time, but that doesn't mean I don't play on offical servers. Since the release of TF2's newest update, I haven't played online so I wasn't aware of the problem, then I saw the newest reviews talking about it, so I rushed into playing TF2 to make sure. Now I'm offically done. I don't want to play a game where I choose to have a game of chance to see if I could play on an offical server or not (which would waste 5 hours of my life), play on an awful community server where there's nothing but ads and 'pay to become VIP' garbage, or play with bots all the time.  In conclusion, Team Fortress 2 is a great game developed by Valve, now Valve have killed it. Lastly, here are three messages: To old TF2 players who haven't played it in a long time: Don't bother playing it again. To people who never played it: Don't bother trying it. To Valve: F**k off."
"Amazing, but they could do better. i think they SHOULD get rid of matchmaking."
"The new matchmaking system is evidence as to Valve's desire to eliminate the disparities between cs:go and tf2. What they have failed to realize is the fact that players don't want extremely similar games, nor do they want further inefficiencies introduced into the existing systems. The most predominant issues with this game are new 'features' recently introduced. Valve is attempting to cut their losses at this point, as Overwatch is depleting what little remained of the tf2 community. They will attempt to con you into buying a 'competitive match making pass', my advice ; stay away from this steaming pile of 'something'."
What a good game!    IT USED TO BE NOW ITS ♥♥♥♥ED
"I had a blast playing this game. Wasted 4 hours of my life just on the tutorial, but no complaint about that. Best free game ever."
"Team fortress 2 the most played game in my library. TF2 has it all, funny, action, team work, gore, replayabilty. so im going to divide it up into those 5 parts.  1st-Funny/comical TF2 has a very cartonny look. not to say that is bad, it actually makes the game that much better. it also has many funny cosmetics and taunts. the name tags and description tags are a good way to make people laugh with any funny name you decide to put on it*. the meet the classes are very funny also.   *beware there are mature players on this game so there will be a few NSFW (not safe for work) names on some guns. for example i have a gun named 'The tampon' with the description being, 'It has blood on it and it heals. What more do you need in a tampon?'  2nd- action TF2 is and always will be a FPS (first-person shooter) it is not as popular as COD or BF4, but it has just as much action. in TF2 you have 9 classes each with diffrent play styles. (i will not go into depth with each one.) Each one adds something new to the battlefield so that players will always be looking for cover or that one medic on your team. In short it is very fast paced but still very fun.  3rd- Team work  TF2 has team work in its name, thus it is centered around team work. Although some matched will have you felling like you were just left for dead, most matches won't. for every match that lacks in team work there are 10 or more that make up for it.  4th-gore Like i said it is a cartonny game but that dosen't mean that it dosent have its fair share of gore. You will see bodies blowing up with blood following it. Keep in mind that this game does not thrive on this, that only happens when you get killed by an explosive. and when it does happen you won't see much of the gorey bits because most of it is croped out of the screen because of a window that appears when you die.  5th-replayabilty  This game is hihgly replayable. Although it can get tedious from now and then, all you have to do is play with a buddy and it gets way more better. And if it dosen't, playing games like CS:GO that is very fun but at the same time stressful, will have you wanting to play a game like TF2.  in short this game can be very fun but can get tedious. when that happens just play a diffrent more realistic game you will realise how fun TF2 can be.  Note: the community for this game is not the best but is very friendly"
Don't be those FNAF Meme kids and say 'I've only played a little bit. It's OK.' You aready know this game is OK.   
Fun Game. EVERYONE SHOULD GET IT AND PLAY IT AND BECOME A MEXICAN LIKE ME!
is good... game of hats
New taunts Cool weapons Cool gamemodes Unusuals stranges new maps workshop and FREE GAME!
This is best Multiplayer game ever I had! I can't say anymore importantly this is very fun!!!! :D
"its better than CS:GO, and theres no R8 in this game :3"
"This is a really fun game, it is creative, and free!! thats what i like about it"
it's good.
"This is one of the few shooters where teamwork &gt; individual skill.Also there are 9 very fun cartoonish characters out there,each one with their own advantages and disadvantages + lots of weapons =&gt; many different playstyles. If you're tired of mindless shooters where USA is the hero and bam bam...give a try to team fortress 2."
"Yes is very fun and lots of fun players around. But i have this one problem that really fustrated and you better see this Valve. The one most major problem are accuracy. There are some classes that when you shoot is doesn't even register same with some melee too. Like the sniper i totally headshot a person sometimes is bodyshot fine with that but again when i do it, it doesn't even register when i totally aim right in the head. Now there the melee the market gardener sometimes is work fine but sometimes when i slap a person it doesn't register and i can tell i hit that person because it made the sound when the market gardener hit. Same with the pan it made that annoying sound but funny sound when i hit someone but is doesn't register the damage. Valve please fix this"
"Out of all the games I own, and have played, this one never fails to bring me back. I love the class system it offers, and the maps are always enjoyable and fun to play on. It doesn't matter if I have 50 kills or 50 deaths, I always have a great time playing Team Fortress 2.   Definitely a must have for your Steam Library!"
10/10 wud judge people by there hats again.
"I've played this game once or twice, so y'know. Id say its ok"
You can wear robotic hotdogs. 10/10
"Soo addicting. Collected hats, killed noobs, got jumped on and killed by Snipers, pushed people off of edges, trapped people in small confined rooms. 10/10 would buy again."
This amazing Free to play game is the best first it has items over 50 weapons maybe even more over 200 hats  All I can say is this game desevers The game of the year!
"If you have Steam, but don't have TF2. Then I think you need to rethink your life decisions."
Lots of ways to play. Pretty fun.
I like this game it makes me relaxed when I´m not
this game ruined my life im obsessed with it and i have a ton of merchandise 10/10
"This game is freaking AWESOME!You can play it over and over again because it's not possible to get bored of it!Unlimited customization,amazing guns and tons of fun!See you in the game!"
"This Hat Simulator is AMAZING, all the hats you can dream of. Plus some cool weapons."
"If you want to defeat a mexican FTB scrub who bangs his girlfriend every day (Big Nikki) , Go rage heavy because you can't kill anyone (turner) , buy an australium , think that equals skill , get called a scrub tell your dad and make him say' Don't mess with my son no more!' (A-Scrub) , fail to be a meat shield and try to scam someone ( Kumascrub) , pwn everyone with the sexy fish slap (JDbest45), be a little jewish kid who swears and hasn't hit puberty ( Gruntled) , and best of all be the best spy around and destroy everyone with the strange enforcer and YER (Embest) . If all of that sounded appealing PLAY THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 11/10 IGN would do it again."
fun to play when your not a anoyed -wink wink- also fun to play with friends and gets your skills on other games up as well
You know your wallet is gonna be empty when recieving a major update.
10/10 would spy crab again
"This game, get it NOW. 948 hours of entertainment and it's still fun. And hey, it's free now. GET THIS GAME."
This is probaly te best game ive played in my entire life. I regret nothing.
This is the best free game ever
This Game is filled with content and never stops with the fun. So much to learn and u can even ear money from this game.
Awesome and free! What's not to love?! :D
Pootis. Nope.
It's time to undo the abysmal Meet your Match update volvo.
this game is very fun would recomend it 2 everyone
Do you guys think this is still going to be the best hat simulator in 2016?
"Have you ever wanted to hit someone, but you actually didnt want to hit them and you had an emotional break down on the inside weither to hit them or not? well look no further! TF2 will let you hit everyone without hurting them with its legendary hitboxes! bask in glory as you headshot someone 425 times and deal 0 damage! beat the crap out of people with your katana and watch them come out unscathed!"
"Simple, this game is to much fun! and there are hat :D"
This game is awesome! 11/10 and you can't stop after an hour of gameplay!
i love this game its very fast paced and offers a variety of different game modes both made by the community and officialy realeased
I got a hat and it looks cool. 10/10
"Great game, addicting, free"
This game offers hours of fun!
like everything about this game.
I made a conga chain and then led the entire chain into a train on CP_Well.  10/10 would conga again.
"What can I say, this is one of my favorite games ever. Classes are balanced, teamwork is existent (!!), and the hats are beautiful. You can play it seriously, you can play it casually, you can even sit in trade servers and play the market meta-game! There's fun for everyone, this is the only game where you can be in a heated battle and then join a giant congo dance party with your enemies in the middle of a match. The community is amazing.  I love this game. 11/10 best game on Steam."
"A nice game! I have got the game before it was announced to be free to play and I can say that the game is awesome, but there is one problem... Now there are a lot of items which is actually ok, I mean, you can customize your classes how you want, but speaking about the economy, I think it was much better before it was announced to be free to play.  9.5/10"
"Resubbing becasue this update is aids, everything is broken, ranked is a joke, not even close to balanced teams, I've been playing this game for over 1000hrs and I can't even get out of the first rank. gg Valve."
Best hat simulator 20XX
TF2 a very good game id would recommend it to you if you like FPS and action based games it has a lots of weapons.
This game is great! Fun game play with pretty graphics. I like the screams of all of the people I've tickled. T'was fun. I will also do episodes on it on my channel (BartyBlue / Determined)
Great game!
"Fun, addicting."
"A great multiplayer game for anyone who likes good pvp fps games. Many fun times are going to be had if you play this game, especially with friends."
Crazy addictive
So... when's TF3? :3
Nice game
i got tf2 about 3 montths ago. since then the game has only got better. definate 10/10
the game sucks. dont play it.
"So much fashion, needs more hats.  Some people say this game is about fighting enemies.  This is not true. Think I'm lying? Count the amount of hats VS the amount of weapons.  9.5/10   I'm not serious. "
Just flat out AMAZING! GET IT ITS FREE JUSTT TRY IT OUT!
"This Game is So fun, it has much more content than any other fps would have."
really fun and addictive
This game might seem violent but its really not. There is not a lot of blood and the game is more fun then i could ask for. It's the type of game that you play when you want to play with friends or just fight other people. And the more you play the more cool stuff you'll receive in the game. But if you don't want to kill other people then you can do mann vs. machine which is where you fight robots along with 5 other people. It's really fun and it will make you a happy player.
It is fun for some time...
"Hats, beards and birds in crates. What more could you ask for? oh yeah, skins."
"This 3D animated shooter is the perfect game for all Valve fans! A complete 10/10, but you have to make sure not to be tempted by the 'hats'. The 'hats' are the way to show victory and coolness in TF2, but some hats require purchasing them with real life money and are not aquireable in any other way. The classes are amazing and one of my favorites being Spy, you can unlock certain items by playing the game or earning achievements without paying money. This aspect of the game brings the fun of showing off your items without paying the five dollars for an awesome hat! Honestly not the best game I've played, but possibly the second or third. The classes are fun in many different ways.  - The scout has super speed and can really mess up the other team. - The soldier has a rocket jump which can be used to camp and fire. - The pyro gets an airblast that can deflect most things. Rocket? AIRBLAST!!! - The demoman can spam grenades at you and sticky bomb the entire base if he wants. - The heavy has loads of ammo and good strength, but bad speed and bad aim unless up close. - The engineer can place sentries, dispensers, and teleporters to protect areas. - The medic has a very rapid gun as well as a Medigun which heals other players (best with the heavy). - The sniper can be horrible up close, but he can make headshots and instakill players with his sniper rifle. - The spy can disguise as the other team and even take down the engineer's buildings.  Even if the game costed money, it would still be worth it. Once again, a full 10/10."
SWEET GAME :p
This Is A REALY AWESOME GAME !!! :) :) :) :) :) 
Probably the best game in the world. Gotta love this game. This never get old and is now free on steam ! GET IT BOY !
The very finest in class-based team hat simulators.
It's a pretty good FPS and the best part about it is that its FREE!
This game is halourios and recommend i. :P 
"Alright, so i decided to come back and re-do my review.. and well, here's my thoughts.. Long ago, on august 25th of 2014 i got 'Team Fortress 2' and it became one of my favorite games.. sometime during january of 2015 i upgraded to premium, this game is one of the most fun games i've ever played.. and its practically the defining game of class based shooters.. however, many times during my gameplay i was thinking of just quitting, until gun mettle was released i found TF2 REALLY boring at times.. so now.. onto the pros, and cons, PROS: Lots of cosmetics, something that lets you customize your character like you cant in any other game! A nice variety of weapons! Custom sprays! So much more that i cannot list! But its also got a lot of. CONS: Someone on your team is ALWAYS afk, the day your team can actually have a non-afk member is the day half-life 3 is out On trade servers, someone always sprays up ecchi or hentai, which is just ew, You will be f2p for almost all of your tf2 career, ADMIT IT, you couldnt get an aussie so you bought one,  And thats really all for cons.. but there is neutrals NEUTRAL POINTS: You meet alot of people, good AND bad, You meet alot of weebs, can be good or bad You meet alot of FNaF fanboys, can be good, but is normally BAD You meet alot of tryhards, who just bought everything on the market they could afford, You met me, and begged for my aussies, and i said no, and declined your friend request Scout may as well be the new best class, good for me, bad for you! Sniper gets the machina, one of the most stupidly op weapons in the game.. The AWPer hand is not the bodyshot king it's cs:go brethren is,  and most importantly.. SO MANY CHILDREN!!! some of them are good, and are actually funny, but most of em just suck at the game and had a bad day at school, so they cry into the mic and get banned within their 2 seconds online,  OVERALL I RATE THIS GAME 8.5/10 i took off 1.5 points for all the squeakers, tryhards, and etc. that makes this game SUCK at times.. but i still love this game :D"
I recommend this game simply because you are gay and i like eating donky rainbows and fighting cows on marijuana.
"This is... god... you know what i hate this.  Pick the right server: get killed a million times but have fun once you get the hang of it and possibly get a friend.  Pick the wrong server: get Spawn killed, Killed by hackers, Killed by tf2 vets, booted for high ping, kicked for no reason, kicked because you are doing too good, kicked because you arent good, kicked because no one likes you, kicked because everyone is flaming you and oh yeah CALLED A F*G BY DUMB ♥♥♥ P***KS!!!  Pick wisely or get screwed out of a good time!  P.S. I didnt catch hat addiction, cheers!"
this game has given me hours of fun and now its free theres no reason not to download it 
Most Awesome game created by VALVE!!!
First person shooter with a full economy enclosed and amazing fanbase. What's not to love?
"'s good idk you waste money in pixels and stuff, and now it is getting competitive"
"Yes, this game is deffinately awesome. Since it used to be Pay 2 Play before it went F2P, it still keeps a lot of the P2P structure. You only need to spend money on items. And, a rarity among MMOFPS games, THERE IS NO VIRTUAL CURRENCY. It's all items and crafting ingredients. Now, onto the game. This game is seriously fun. The different classes are all...well....different, and trust me, you will not get bored for a while. This is a really good game. Have fun!"
Team Fortress is very fun alone and with friends so i definetly recommend this 
A really great game to play with friends!
I love this game so much! Well worth the download time and spending a little money too!
Number one game I'd recommend to anyone. Hundreds of playstyles.
"If your tired of CoD or battlefield, or just want a change of pace, try this. it's really fun when you play with your friends (if u have any =P) and best of all, its not a single bit realistic!"
Noice game
"Hello Players! As you may see I have played Team Fortress 2 for only 6 hours, but I can say I really enjoy it. It is even more interesting then other First Person Shooter Games, like Counter Strike - Global Offensive, that you have to pay for. This game is free and is probably one of the best ones you can get for free. Unlike CS:GO there is a balance in game, so there are no super MEGA players who wreck every single one, even if you are new you have a chance of killing a player with good stuff. There are also different classes or roles you can play for example Medic, Heavy or Sniper. Everyone has it's job. If you are good at specific class you are free to play with it. Items are also not expensive and you get them for free while in-game! Anyways, thanks to the Team Fortress 2 developers, I am not sure who they are and enjoy the game. Hope you like it. Strongly recomender 9-10/10 Yours,  AntonGod"
what a cool game to play .. join me now and lets rock !
"It's a very good game, the graphic the characters the weapons and the gameplay is awesome, I think it deserves some of you money, I suggest not more than 10 euros"
"I've been playing for a short amount of time, and this game is awesome for a F2P game. It ruined my life.  11/10"
"Pretty fun game, i really like that you can trade stuff. So many different ways to play, it's unbelievable. (Meet your Match is a good update with some flaws in my opinion)"
"Tf2 is the only shooter that has captivated me and kept me going for such a long time. The entertaining characters and fun to use weapans add a lot too. The unnoficial name of hat forteress 2 is wrong. This is more than a hat fest, it's one of the greatest games of all time"
the epic and best team fps you'll play &gt;:3
I sacrifice events in order to play this game for hours and hours -- I REGRET NOTHINGGGG! (It's like the Mario of FPS; perfect all-around and VERYVERY FUN.)
"One of the only, if not the only, games out there with a healthy, living economy. Not a businessman? There's still plenty of fun with those nine classes, not to mention the different loadout combos for each. Uber fun game for people looking for a good time killer. Over 9000/10"
"This Game is free, yes. BUT it used to be 20 dollors but now that its free 2 play and people tend to think that free to play games are poorly designed, well i have 3 games that are free and they are greatly designed and tf2 is one of the best games on steam im sure of it theres always players on a server and it is SO fun all of my friends have it and so do other people. Cod players who thinks its ♥♥♥♥ YOUR COD SKILLS DONT TRANSFER HERE GOT IT? anyway i have over 3000 hrs on it and i can coach it to ya or friend me if u wanna play it with me  so do i recommend it? heck ya! with balanced gaemplay hats, 9 classes, lots a weps, funny classes each with there own do's and donts, weaknesses, strenghths, balances, limits, and whatnot  so get this game because i cant go a month without playing it its so fun  so merc's, get out there and commit war crimes!"
cool
this game is the best for free :)
"Nothing to say really about this game but that its been completley perfected. Has a few hackers and such here and there, but truthfully I dont think this game will last much longer due to the hackers and lack of content, all the updates bring in this game is pretty much reskins of weapons, cosmetics and such.  7/10"
"10/10 Would Keep Playing For Everyone who like PC Modern FPS Games, This is a really Great Choice."
"This Game it is great, I mean its so good that some times for something I would be a gigantic amount of time late for some ♥♥♥♥ I have to do. So lets get to the point its so fun im addicted. Yah I said it im addicted. "
  I r8 9/11. Many f2ps running around with bad weapons. demos flying with cabers and medics healing soldiers with unusuals.
Killed guys doing conga. Get banned. 420/xxx
Great game :)
I am completely obsessed!!!!! Amazing game. I highly Recommend it!!!!!!!
It is a very good game a 9 class first person shooter 2 team based game 10/10
"this is one of my all time favorite games. Classic shooter, solid mechanics, balanced classes (which are each extremely customizable), different game modes, a lot of humor, and just plain fun gameplay. Trading makes it a lot more awesome, too. Get this game. It's free :D"
"This game... it's amazing. The community's very active (the development portion at least) and, while there can be some nubs here and there... er... everywhere, it just makes it even more fun. The class based combat is very integral to the game and has pretty much become it's selling point aside from it's weapons. While they aren't adding many nowadays, the weapons we have now (as well as the stock weapon skins if you want to consider them weapons) are very well thought out and each provides it's own unique playstyle. It's market thrives off of cosmetics and hats, to the point where community members may call it a hat simulator with guns, but that makes it even more fun! Just like the weapons, cosmetics can be equipped and can be mixed and matched to make unique combinations. It has withstanded the test of time and is still one of the most popular games on the steam engine. Overall, it is one of my most loved games in my library, and I doubt I'll ever hold a game in such a high regard ever again."
Get it it is free and you dont have to spend money but there is the option too
Pyro class is very ♥♥♥♥ing crazy BRA
"This game have the best trading , Best Commuinty , Best game also it's free to play  And you will enjoy this game if you didn't there is tons of free to play games like Dota 2 and Quake Live and alot"
"Team fortress 2 is the best shooter I have ever played, with its cartoon-y atmosphere but violent story, it makes a great mixture to create a amazing game, though the new update wasn't the best, it wasn't the worst, and still I think highly of this game, and I totally recommend this game, play for free now! "
"One of the BEST Fps game ive ever played... i mean you get hats, hats, more hats, and let me see HATSSSSS!"
"Extremely fun and has incredible levels of replayability.   Sadly, though it has begun to feel like Counter Strike: Global Offensive, due to the implementation of skins to weapons.   I am on my phone right now so I cannot make a full review, so I'll leave it at this:  'Buy' this game if you want a good game to play while waiting for a new release.   Tip: Players will be somewhat hostile to you because of your playtime status. Just be vigilant and don't listen."
I used to like it.  Now it's just the free version of CS:GO.  
It's nice
"Seriously, if you haven't played this game yet where the heck have you been for the past 6 years (or whatever)?  YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BUY IT, THE GAME ROCKS, WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?!"
Pretty good
hats
"Remember kids, all the money you spend on this game, goes to a good cause.... Gabens Snack Fund"
3 per day times 6 years minus we're not bread/10
"Started as F2P. Ended up with 3 Unusuals, A backpack full of ♥♥♥♥, and a lot of friends who also have unusuals and backpacks full of ♥♥♥♥.  10/10 It was ok. IGN Approved."
Very dumb game
"Well, it's hard for me to describe TF2. How can someone talk using his reason about something that he loves? Damn, i don't know how. For me there isn't no words to describe this incredible piece of ♥♥♥♥. That's not just a game. It's clearly much more than that. The only thing i can say is that this thing is really ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. No further comments about. Ps. i REALLY REALLY LOVE THAT CRAP. :D"
10/10 would bang
Just a rip off of Call Of Duty MW2 except without quick scopes. 2/10
is rlly good. lik it vry much
"gud game, but I ♥♥♥♥ing hate the f2p little kids"
"Hats. 11/10   Update: July 8th 2016 -- 2,341 hours played. I can tell you that this game is great. As of now, TF2 has recieved a full competitive mode and also a revamp of casual mode. The game is free so unless you are data capped or something, definitely download it and give it a try. There will be a bit of a learning curve if you are not familiar with video games, however there is a 'tutorial mode' if you want to learn how to play soldier or engineer. You will have to figure out the rest of the classes yourself."
"You get to walk around with a bunch of shooty people and stuff, fighting and ♥♥♥♥"
This Game Is Alot Of Fun And Leaves My Wallet Empty :P 10/10
"This game provides you with endless hours of fun, and joy. Once you play, you won't stop. 10/10"
I Recommend This Game For Garry's Mod To Get EXTRA FEED
"Great game, nothing more needed to say."
"Really good addictive game, worth of spending time."
Review a Game to earn: 'Pillar of Community' 10/10 would r8 again.
This is like the best action game everrrrrrrrrrrr 
5 stars. addictive you should play!
this game needs more noscopes and lots more uavs and k-9 units!!11!1! weneed to ad socre strekes so we can fnlly get cair packages. dud like srsly this game is wors than cod i would play cod any day bcuz this gam is so totally gay. i could prob rekt u all in tf3 and cod modern fair wars 6. u all suck at computer games and i could probably beat you all go back to playing mnecraft n stuff &gt;;^((((.
This game in my opinion might be the best free to play shooter on steam. the maps are structured well each game mode is unique and has me playing til my hands hurt. No this isn't your usual usage of Call of Duty or Battlefield. But it's not supposed to be. Those games don't have as strong as a community as Tf2 does. These people work as hard as they have their entire lives just to pump out really awesome custom maps. Say what you want but Tf2 isn't just a regular FPS. It is the most fun you can have on Steam and IT'S FREE. Definitely give this game a shot if you don't know what to do on steam.
"9 Diffrent Unique Classes to choose from,each with thier own types of weapons.Get Item drops for Free for more Weapons,but try to be a Premium,cause you will regret it if you're still not a Premium yet..."
Best Free to play game and hat simulator In History
"Love everything about this game! Beautiful graphics, amazing gameplay, and flow with 1960's-ish styling. Weapon and class combinations allow for various styles of gameplay, and the addition of cosmetics, taunts, and skins provide hours of enjoyment. Gameplay supports everyone from new to competitive. Highly recommended!"
"  Ive been playing this game for more than 2 years, ive made some of my closest buddys on this lovely first person shooter on some great community servers. The classes are unique and (generally) balanced, the large selection of weapons makes for good changes in pace and strats, and, of course, H a t s.  But i personally enjoy the community servers above all else, the many minigames, maps, and groups all make for a lovely new way to experience this game. You'll barely have a dull moment.  Another good thing about the game is the teamwork, being able to plan attacks or change defences is what makes this game charming, this aspect is most certainly seen the most in the Mann VS Machine gamemode, as well.  The game, of course, is not without its problems. Valve isn't perfect, the community isn't perfect. It takes some time to get into the swing of this game, And it might not be for everybody. But beside all of the minor things, this game is most certainly worth the look.  "
Overwatch is just TF2 with Waifus
Children play Call of Duty Boys play Battlefield Men play Counterstrike Geezers play ARMA Corpses play Team Fortress 2
Now with more bread
Want to jump around like an annoying prick who can dodge literally anything that's thrown at him?  Want to use your ammunition to propel yourself across the map at incredibly high speeds and shoot a barrage of high powered rockets in the faces of your enemies?  Want to burn down the homes of those you hate and simultaneously think about unicorns and rainbows?  Want to operate highly explosive bombs and grenades while shouting like a drunk scottish man wielding a medieval sword?  Want to eat sandviches?  Want to carry your team by sticking a life saving device up other people's butts and become the center of attention because everyone either loves or hates your very soul?  Want to build aimbot guns that do all of the work for you while you sit in a chair and drink beer?  Want to be an MLG 360 noscope champion who throws ♥♥♥♥ at people?  Want to use invisible hacks and kill other players in just one hit by pretending you're one of their friends?  Then play TF2. 10/10 would wear a hat again.
"one of the best games available around the world. i would like to recommend it to everyone! IT'S F2P game! start playing, have a lot of fun,make friends, share your handmade items, rate/join TF2 discussions and most important thing! You can trade all your items to other players around the world!!"
"9 classes 3 each for support,defense, and offense with free dropable weapons and more hats than you can ask for! You can count me in!"
Tf2 Has Many Friendly Users And Some Aren't Good cause Of Disrespecting Each Other . This Game Is So Good For Me . I Would Like To Play This game Always When I'm Free
i just want to get the badge
Next gen hat simulator. 21/10
team fortress 2 good game to play laugh
ruined my life
Shoot people. Rage. Spend way too much money in this game even though it's free. Quit for a while because you're shet. Get addicted again while still being shet. Talk shiit. Memes. Play on Valve servers so you can laugh your butt off.  10/10 It's ok.
it's ok I guess.
its a great game lots of uniqe weaposn hat etc
"After spending countless hours mindlessly struggling in the TF2 hatconomy, I can honestly say this game is most likely the product of Satan ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ after eating Mexican food while force feeding himself liquified hats and the souls of the tormented through a funnel.  9/10"
Hats hats hats and hats. Who needs weapons when you got hats?  10/10 hats   Would hat again.
"Picks Scout, gets flattened by soldier Picks Soldier, gets killed by other soldier with Air Strike Picks Pyro, gets killed by heavy aroung a corner Picks Demo, gets killed by soldier using a leg of lamb Picks Heavy, gets stabbed by a spy Picks Medic, gets killed by everyone at once Picks Engineer, gets stabbed by spy Picks sniper, killed by flying pyro Picks spy, gets killed by soldier accidentally.   gr8 game m8 10/11"
GO PLAY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME I WILL PLAY THIS GAME WITH YOU IF YOU GET THIS GAME I WILL NEVER STOP PLAYING THIS GAME THIS IS THE BEST GAME YOU WILL EVER PLAY AND YOU WILL NEVER PLAY A BETTER GAME ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS SELECT PYRO AND HOLD LEFT MOUSE AND EVERYTHING DIES AND YOUR TEAM COMMENDS YOU SO YOU NEED TO GO DO THAT RIGHT NOW AND GET THIS GAME AND DID I MENTION GET THIS GAME
it is a very fun game if u like fps that are not pay to win i recomend u can pay the game money but every item has a down side 
OMG! I love this game so much!
What I like about playing this game is how you almost never never have the same experience with a single gamemode or map even after having played it a bunch. I highly recommend this game for people who are interested in strategy games that require cooperation with teammates to ensure an overall successful victory.
"This game is great, ive been playing this sincei made my steam account, and its been a very very fun game, id definitly recomend this game to anybody wanting a free to play game "
What tf2 did to me:  Made me happy   10/10 - Ign 
Best free game.
"A very fun mixed class shooter. Skills are required and earned as you go on. With a unique item unlocking system, the defaults will never get old. Highly recommended"
"Good game for people who have lots of money! It is very fun and I love the game, I'm addicted to it as much as I am as to Dead By Daylight. SOO ummmmm. This review tho"
Team Fortress2 !!!!!!!BABY
  'Check this box if you received this product for free'  &gt;mfw TF2 is F2P &gt;not sure if received for free or not  Anyway as for my review... The only ones who do not recommend this game are Spies
"won the game and insta killed a demoman  saw a medic cowering in fear, offered him a game of rock paper scissors, he simply stood there, cowering in fear, so I shotgunned him where he stood  10/10, will commit war crimes again"
"Team Fortress 2 is a great and easy to play FPS game with a lot of acheivments,weapons and hats to unlock. Great game to play with friends or by yourself.. If you feel like making some buisnes with other players you can even trade items with them! This game is not like any other FPS game and is a little hard to play at first,but it gets easier to play after you find the perfect class for you."
"Team Fortress 2 is, by any measure, an amazing free-to-play game.   - There is absolutely zero pay-to-win in this game. All weapons are balanced - the weapons you start with, in fact, are usually the best ones all-around. The others can be acquired very quickly and easily. All items that are not easy to get have no effect on gameplay at all. If you choose to become premium, it is dirt cheap also.   - The combat is fun, skill-based, and balanced, on the whole. All classes, mechanics, and weapons have their time and place, and they are all entertaining to play. A few mechanics are frustrating (Random Crits come to mind), but they are few and minor qualms.   Team Fortress 2 is, in my opinion, the most fun, most addicting shooter available. It's free to play, it will run on almost any computer, and it's awesome - there is almost no reason NOT to give it a shot!"
Super fun game with good fun gameplay and friendly players. kinda like a comic style first person shooter game...and just a little bit insane XD
This is the greatest game ever if you like robots shooting action gore multiplayer free to play games hats taunts and much more i see this game as life best game i ever played and will always play almost there to 1000 hours of gameplay sweet sweet victory i would like a 10 class tho that would be amazing!!!1
"What can I say, You are a Pixel character that comes in many forms with given skills and weapons to do tasks. Whether it be to defend your base, capturing a point or Killing that Backstabing Spy, This game enhances your gaming experience and takes it to a whole new level. Lots of people gave this bad and good reviews but if you really thing about it, go to anyones profile and 90% of the Community has this as their main played game and over 1,000 hours. This is a good game under the genres Shooter and lets you show off your skills, techniques, items to flaunt, trade, collect and so much more. I give this game a positive review and it's gonna be a perfect score for me."
10/10. Best place to make 10 year olds legally cry and scream on the mic. Also a great place to play P0rn videos at full volume on a crowded server.
I like the community of tf2 and how after 10 years it is still working and thriving such as the frontline and Mayann update
"It's great! very immersive online gameplay, with an amazing community (especially trading) would recommend on a whim!"
Very fun and epic
Very good and very addicting love the community as well as the trading :D
I made my bread bakery in this game.  10/10
Die by your own Medic       10/10
A hell of a lot of fun
This is not a game. It is a reason to question why your team has 5 Scouts/Sinpers/Spys.   Gibus/10
"love the comunity, and the gamers on it"
Totally worth 0$
"iF YOU LIKE FRENCH MEN WHO GO STAB,FAT RUSSIAN MEN WITH MINI GUNS, AND A PYRO WITH A QUSTIONALBLE BACKGROUND THIS GAME IS FOR YOU...(WE ARE NOT HEALD ACOUNTABLE FOR INEVITABLE RAGE, sERIOUSLY IT WILL HAPPEN...IT DRIVES FRIENDSHIPS APART!!!) HAVE FUN PLAYING"
"Although I doubt anyone with a steam account hasn't downloaded this game, it's great and free no reason not to get it,"
"Awesome class based F2P FPS with great gamplay, wacky and cartoon-ish graphics, hilarious voice sound track, and best of all, it's not a pay to win!"
"I used to be unsure weather or not I'd like TF2, but once I tried it I couldn't stop, I was addicted. Although the game may seem limited on the outside, with only 9 classes and a few gamemodes, but on the inside TF2 is one of Valve's best games. Right now it's one of my favorites!"
"There was time above, A time before. There were perfect things. TF2 absolutes. But TF2 falls. TF2 on earth. And what falls...is fallen."
"The game 'Team Fortress 2' has been turned into a csgo copy but free. When Valve deleted the server list i was devistated, I spent money on servers for V.I.P for perks, and Valve turned that money to waste. Valve a serverlist and everyting you removed came back, That would be highly appreciated. You Turned The Greatest Game Ever Into A Down Populating No Server Filled Game."
"I used to love TF2. It still holds a special place in my heart, you know. But I can't play it - not when it's left in this sort of state.  Nerfs nobody needed, buffs nobody wanted, changes that nobody asked for. A pro player had to talk them out of changing a weapon for a game they (Valve) don't even play any more. A casual mode involving queuing, leaving penalties, lack of choice regarding maps and modes. Said casual mode was only 'fixed' following the game's community lashing out.  TF2's faults are many, but I can ignore them. The thing is that I can't recommend a game when the developers don't care about it. It's clear to me that Valve only keeps TF2 going because it's earning them money. They don't want to put the effort into playing their own game or communicating with its community. I mean, the worst thing about everything that's gone wrong with the game is that it could all have been avoided if Valve didn't ignore the community until everything reached boiling point.  I'm not angry at anyone. There's no point in being angry at this. I'm just disappointed. So very, very, disappointed."
"Played it for about 5 years and had good fun. But the latest update made it much more difficult to have fun. Before I could just jump in a random game, kill everything, then jump out. Now they force me into a pre selected team, I watch every person get slaughtered by a single soldier or demo, then we lose without capping a single point or getting the cart to the first point or even holding a point in KOTH for one second. Then the game punishes me for leaving because I know we lost.   And what the hell is with a leveling system they now put in? I only see it as a 'Look how much of a life I don't have' meter since it doesn't buff anything for the actual gameplay. TF2 has changed a good deal since I started playing it. And not the good kind. Thanks Obama"
Matchmaking update has ruined this game.  1. casual matchmaking is unbalanced as ♥♥♥♥ if you want to find a balanced game even community servers cannot help you due to the fact that they have become full of players 10x your skill level.  2. competitive matchmaking costs money  3. this wasn't in that update but demoknight my no.1 way to play this has been nerfed along with the loch and load which did need it but not as harshly as it has been.  all in all this game has gone from one of the reasons I got a gaming PC to pure ♥♥♥♥♥. Save yourself the memory space.
"I recently came back to the game after the matchmaking update. I was shocked to see a stupid waiting system like in CS:GO. No this was not for competitive, but for casual ('normal' games). Unlike before, where I could log on and have a quick game, now I have to wait 1-2 mins extra. ♥♥♥♥ you Valve, you ruined one of my all time favourites."
The newest update has destroyed any decent gameplay. Almost impossible to build up a team when everyone gets thrown out at the end of a short match.  Unusable now - which is so sad as it used to be great. The new MATCH mode sucks. 
"New update sucks. Change it back to the old UI now. It really is funny how Valve tries to keep this game alive in the see of class-based multiplayer shooters out right now, but by making this update Team Fortress 2 is going to die even faster. We should probably hold a funeral for TF2, because it is going to die soon if this update isn't fixed, and the UI isn't improved."
"I wish there was time travel to go back a few months, because this update is ♥♥♥♥!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"After 2000+ hours of enjoying this game it has been killed with the worst update its ever had and I think it's time to throw in the towel. Why can there not be pub servers AND matchmaking? Every time I've waited far too long to join a game it only lasts 2 rounds, OR you join half way through the second round only to then have to quit to find another match? Shocking isn't the word.... Sort yourself out Valve"
"This game used to be great. But then valve started to ignore it. We went a year without updates, and then we got.. MYM... They, well, ruined the game. it's terrible now. It may be free but now, I wouldn't say its even worth downloading."
Much Gameplay. Wow. Many Hats. Pls Play.
"This is an awesome game for awesome people, or things and everyone AND thing may i add that games should get this game, its free and if you dont like it then just uninstall it, thats it here."
"Valve please just get rid of this update, it has made the game both literally and figuratively unplayable it freezes almost evrytime i play and the removal of quickplay was a mistake"
"This game was the first one I got on steam. It has a lot to offer: nine different classes to choose from/kill, hunreds of unique weapons, and a massive online community. Not to mention HATS! If you play this game, you will not regret it."
Ruined my life. Made me addicted to PC Games.  Best. Game. Ever.
"This game may be free, but I spent over 50$ on it and it was worth it!!! LUV THIS GAME!!!!!"
In-game hats worth more than real hats 10/10
"Good game, found all my friends on it xP"
bad GAME -.-   SO much idiots are in the game -.- so the game suck
As you can see thousands of hours are not enough for that brilliant game &lt;3 Its just amazing to see a goos team based multiplayer game thats soo simple but totally fantastic :D so yeah this review should show that i like tf2 very much and you guys should defently have it in your library!
It's free. Forever. Go online and play and get new items.
"A fun free to play, but you may drift apart from it after a while to play csgo."
mario_kart_20124ever  edit: I dunno if I still do. I mean they removed the bison's intended feature.  That alone bumbs it from 12/10 to 2/10.   Yuh kno wot ohm seyen???
this game sucks.......
"After more than 700 hours put in this game i think its amazing, this last update however is not. I feel that they have taken away some of that which made tf2 great. Valve really messed up this time and they will lose alot of players to overwatch if this is not fixed and fixed fast."
"I have enjoyed this game since I bought it at release in 2007. The game has come a long way since then and had previously only gotten better with each update. As a long time fan it burdens me to give the game a bad review but with this last update of the match making system I must.  Overall it is about lack of player power.  No vote to kick blatant 360 hackers. No auto-adjust teams. You play the teams a computer wants, not what you want/fix poor synergy. Hassle free joining and leaving of lobbies is now a memory. Loss of community feeling with favorite servers no longer allowing 'ad-hoc' connections. Loss of the care-free attitude that made the game fun and relaxing. Loss of game identity. It was TF2, now it is an attempt to be Overwatch.  It was a good run over the years, I hope you revert these silly changes. bluebaron201 "
"One of the easiest game I probably ever played, I never was really into first-person shooters and stuff and I just wanted to try the game out since I found the weapons quite funny (I mean who uses a Macakrel to fight), but anyways I got hooked in a few days. The art is beautiful in a comic way, it's really detailed to the rocks and water, but it always seem to glitch out, I also really like the sound effect and the character's voice that matches their personality perfectly. The game have many classes to chose from and even a larger selection of weapons and cosmetics, unlike most other games. The biggest problem I have with this game is probably the lag and stuff, which really annoys me.I recommend you to have a faster computer or clear out a bit of junk file so it may run smoothly."
Fk my luck uncrating.
"Do you like multiplayer? Do you like to have an arsenal of awesome weapons? Do you like cartoony artstyle? Then Team Fortress 2 is for you. It´s hilariously stupid, and I guarantee you´ll have at least a little fun! If not, well, tough. So, what are you still reading this recommendation for? Go download this game if you have´nt got it already, son!"
Best free game in the world. The classes are awesome and they have a wide variety of weapons. Lots of enjoyable gamemodes. Use a frying pan to kill people. Hats. Any questions?
"Giving a bad review because of the hacking issues. The update I don't mind, it's all the hackers that came with it to quote 'get exp' lol what? The level doesn't mean anything. I report these people and nothing is done about them. Sort it out PLEASE, the opposing team or even team im playing with refuse to vote kick the hackers because I guess they want to win the game and without a person hacking, they couldn't. Before this update, i would run into a couple of hackers every 50-100 games or so. Now? They're in about 50% of each game I play. Do something about it."
"Oh my goodness. I just want to say, what has happened to Team Fortress 2. This game went from being my favourite game, I might even have been a bit addicted to it, and even spent some money on this game, to trash. 800 plus hours, wasted. I remember a few years back, all my friends would come online together and play TF2 for hours, enjoying all the different features of this game, having fun on jailbreak/saxton hale servers, normal casual servers, MVM or just our own custom servers where we would screw around and not care. But those good times are now long gone. Saying 'I still play TF2', is like saying 'CSGO and League of Legends are horrible games'!The past few months, TF2's updates have made the game worse and worse. Like seriously, Valve? Adding skins and conditions to TF2? Having hats and cosmetics were enough to make the game the silly, fun style it was, but having skins isn't fun or goofy, it's just dumb and pointless. What is this? CSGO? Pains me to see my favourite game turn to rubbish. You get penalties as well now? What happened to the game we all loved and enjoyed? Valve, whatever you'll be doing with TF2 in the future, count me out of it. TF2 is a dead game now."
The best shooter I have ever played!

"A very addictive and fun Fps shooter where you fight against cod ♥♥♥♥♥♥s and '1v1 ♥♥♥ at m8 bro ill rekt u' and cod kids trying to 360 noscope and shoot through glass  In other words every once in a while (maybe even often) you'll encounter a aimbotter,speedhacker and much more on the non secure servers, but tf2 is still a great game and next thing you know you'll be in a randomizer gamemode holding a bazzar bargin as a heavy that can build dispensers"

"Top of my addiction list. Play it, and become addicted with me. We can be addiction brothers. No I will not share needles with you. I mean..."
"I've lost my friends and family because they bothered me while playing TF2. My girlfriend left me for another man due to neglect, and I sold my house to buy Keys to open crates. I sold my PC to buy food so I wouldn't starve. I am homeless and currently typing this on a Computer at the Library.  10/10"
Cool
"This game is an amazing game, I have never ever added funds to my steam account but due to this game, I was encouraged to, the game maps are amazing, and the graphics are acceptable and the gameplay, Oh yeah, it's amazing! This game is the best thing that happened to my life! If you are planning on getting the game, don't hesitate! Smash that PLAY BUTTON! VALVE FOR THE WIIIN!"
"  Good game, all round community so pretty much no matter what you wanna play you can find a server for it. But even just the base game is fun enugh to play. I swear only like 50 of my 800 hours are idling."
Hat Simulator 2 Now with conga DLC sandvich/10
"This will technically be my 2nd review on this game as that my last one was 2-3 years ago, i now have ALLOT more expierence in this game and i know nooks and crannies and secrets, but as you are reading this review you probly want to play this game so i won't spoil anything.  One of the best things about this game is that it has its own economy... That fluctuates.... what i mean is that the economy changes like a item on E-bay. You know that one VINTAGE Harmonica your DIEING to get and sometimes the price goes up and sometimes it goes down. the price changes bepending on how rare it is, what its made of, and its demand.  Second thing i love about this game is just the Variety of how you can play it, and i don't mean just 9 out of the 9 classes.  I won't go into the the items you pick up on the way as that would be to much for a little review box.  Scout is fast SURE but he can play as a great distraction against the team and i find him to be more to be a class to stall the enemy team. But thats just how i play, a scout can be right in your face a beat you and blast you solidly in the face. Though with strong weapons and agillity he is also sorta weak, work around that issue the way you see fit.  Soldier is kinda bulky and his weapons are very strong as long as you know how to use them. There is one form of getting around for soldier called a Rocket Jump, a rocket jump is a blast directly under/next to him using the blast force to push him in the desired direction, issue is rocket jumps can harm him and the fall damage of coming back down from the air can hurt too.  Pyro is actually very easy to use if your brand new to the game even if we hate seeing the old fashion 'M1 + W' pyro. he can be very helpful with some expertise as he can reflect rockets back into the senders face with a Air-blast. Pyro can Spy-Check as in BURN the area around him hitting any invisible/disguised spies around. but he is mostly for Short-Range attacks.  Demo can be used 2 very different ways (other ways are available) as explosives are fine and all but you can also go into whats called a 'Demo-knight' and go without any sort of Gun and only use your meelee to cut threw your foes' necks. Issue with explosives he can do harm to himself, and his Demo-knight strategy... well lets face it they have guns and he doesn't... so be careful  Heavy is VERY bulky but has allot of fire power with his minigun and stays alive Via his sandvich, and/or medic, you can also do 'Heavy Boxing' but in a real fight of tf2 i wouldn't recommend it.  Engineer works with his machines but is susceptable to spys, demos, and soldiers. as they can all cause MAJOR harm, even from a distance, to his builds anyhow. Engi is very helpful to his team as he keeps stock to their ammo and health. With a teleporter to get his teammates to locations much faster. But his personal weapons rather than his machines are not exactly strong so you kinda have to rely on your sentry  Medic is extremely smart in machines of the medical type, using his Medi-gun or 'Uber Cannon' as some call it, he can keep everyone in their Peak physical condition, and more so with Overheal. He can revive the dead itself with his expertise. Trouble is that he is definately not built for a fight by himself as he only carries his Medi-gun, a Syringe gun, and a Bone saw   Sniper is pretty easy to guess what his expertise is, he puts bullets threw players' heads! He can be very hard for some to master or some VERY EASY to master, Depending on their past work. He can use a sniper rifles of many varieties or a Bow and Arrow. He uses Jarate wich can be a real harm to the enemy as it causes more damage to them. But as sniper is most of the time scoped in, his peripheral is narrowed, making him susceptable to... well whatevers behind him like spies.  Spy can be very hard to master as he has to go unnoticed by the enemy. Why is this difficult? Because people scream when they have a knife in their back. But spy can become any person on the oppisite team and even his own team to trick them with a Dead Ringer to fake his own death! if disguised as his own team its like they die rather than him. Spy can be extremely powerful if unnoticed but is very weak.  There is many ways to play the game that i won't get into, enjoy Team Fortress 2  10/10"
I have been playing this game for a while and its awesome!
Loved the game. Fun and un-realistic. That might sound bad but it makes it even funner!
tf2 is awesome for anyone with a sense of humor that doesnt have epilepsy.
"Awesome game, play it all the time. Have a truckton of fun with all the cool friends I've made :)"
"HATS. MUST COLLECT HATS.  Oh, and the shooting part is cool. BUT IT'S A SHIDESHOW TO THE HATS."
ultimate hat warfare  i like hats.
This game has taken my life away
Worst 100 dollars of my life
Hat simulator provides you with all your hat needs. Also there is an FPS game mode but I did not bother to check it out.
10/10 cured my cancer
"I don't know why anyone would not recommend this game. I can personally say that the multiplayer is amazing, the achievements are rewarding, and not to mention the awesome community made maps and content! There is a lot of things that you can do in this game! Another thing to mention is that this game DOES have a Workshop. What does that mean? It means that people can freely put up their custom items and if they get ratedd highly enough they can get put into the game!   (I can't say I grew up on Valve, but I find Gabe to be a huge inspiration to me. I can't wait until I can make a mod that is so big to be made into a separate game and get highered on to work there!)"
This is a short description of each class in TF2  -Medic heals people with a magic laser beam  -Sniper shoots people in the head and throws pee in a jar at them  -Demoman he just makes people go Ka BOOM!  -Scout he runs really fast amd has a shotgun  -Heavy he has a massive minigun and he is also fat  -Pyro just BURNS people for fun  - Soldier kicks ♥♥♥ and shoot rockets at people  -Engineer he just builds machines to do his work  -Spy a man who becomes invisible and backstabs people  (Thank you for reading this get TF2 as soons as you can it is a great game)
"It's like barbie game. New update,new outfit. 9/10 no date with Ken"
A awesome most fun game ever in the gaming history and cool items you should play this game and IT'S FREE TO PLAY so play it.
I totally LOVE that game! Every class has its stengths and backsides. You have to think tactical and it's even more fun with friends who play with you.
Team Fortress 2 is one of my favorite games it's easy ad quick to learn how to play. Fun to play with friends and enjoy the games
"Team Fortress 2 is quite possibly one of the best First-Person Shooters ever made. It is very unique in the sense that, rather than being about 'survival of the fittest' like in Call of Duty, Team Fortress 2 is based on teamwork, which makes for a very unique FPS experience. This game has always had me coming back for more, and no matter how long or how many times I play it, it never bores me. Also, ignore everyone saying Overwatch or the Meet Your Match update ruined it, this game is still fantastic."
DIZ IZ COOLZ
Best game probably ever made! And it's free! Just get tha dang game!
What's this!? A Free-To-Play? I thought this was a payed game! This is awesome!
"Where do I begin. Being someone who came from a game like Battlefield, a game I ended up getting great at. This was a totally new playing field for me. I was used to like 4 classes, their are 9 in this game. All with their own strengths, weaknesses, and amazingly well written personalities. This game very quickly became the most fun I've had in a virtual world. Even if you don't win you're gonna have fun, because honestly what other game has american vets shooting rockets at their feet and landing on people's faces while at the same time smacking them with a frying pan!? It's highly entertaining!   Pros- All the classes are useful, and highly situational  A fun loving community, that is all about goofing off Hats to give your classes a hint of your own personality and taste Several weapons that take time to learn how to use correctly Each class has an entertaining personality, and something funny to say While this game is goofy as can be, it can be highly intense Graphics that are very art inspired, thus making them fun to look at Multiple gamemodes so that the fun never stops It never gets repetitive, something new will happen everytime you jump into a match A great soundtrack A very cool secret agent kind of feel, this game takes place in 1972, but has technology that we don't even have to this day, which makes for a really sci-fi-ish feel.  Cons- Occasional bugs, but every game has these Some community members can be very hateful, like telling free to plays that they are worthless, or telling members of fandom groups that they need to kill themselves, however you can't find any perfect community  Two cons? That's it yeah. I honestly can't find anything else negative to say. I got this game way back in January 31st, 2014. I had always wanted it since 2010 but wasn't able to get myself a computer (Mac OSX Air) once I did I played the crap out of this game, and I still play it an insane amount of time, I wanna be a writer, but everytime I get on here to write something I end up starting up Team Fortress 2. Regardless I'll write my book at some point. In closing, thanks to Law Abiding Engineer for giving me tips back when I had only 10 hours logged. GG Valve, your games are legendary."
i love this game! 
played game got bored look at maket sees hats thinks i need them all then spends most of his day trading hats playes game to see hats thinks this is a good game with hats 8/8
Omg... I love that game :D
Yes this game is good but the fact that alot of people tease/make fun of free to play players cause of hats or bad skill or something like that but over all this game is good once you start getting the hang of it.        I recommend this game also its free to play :D.
Good way to pass time while you try to figure out what to play
Hat simulator and a theft. 10/10
"I suck at this game, but i keep playing it  10/10"
This is a great funny shooter game that will be loved by the fans of this type of game especialy because it's free.
this games pretty ♥♥♥♥in fedora but its fun i guess
I've never put more money into a videogame that didn't cost me money to download it in the first place.
one of the best games i ever played
Simply Beautiful
"Team based gameplay mostly revolving around snipers and snappy people with microphones. Good community, nice people, aside from the snappy ones. Would recommend."
"A really good FPS game that involve a lot of shooting, its very fun! and its challenging sometimes!   my rating:  5/5"
I think this is a really good game its just sad many people are giving up on it
"Good game, what sucks is the community. It consists mostly of around 18 yr old YOLO-idiots, homophobics, bronies, furries, sexists and ignorants. There can hardly be a single MVM without harassing, whining and idiotic behavior, annoying setup and ragequitting. There are hardly servers without stupid people on the mic, puking out their racist and intolerant opinions nobody gives a damn about.  Maybe I'm too old for this bull frickin' horse ♥♥♥♥, but I'm really tired of the majority of players here.  BTW, there are also female players out there, so shove your lesbian sprays up your ♥♥♥ and take some more Medic/Engineer action, you homophobic morons."
"I don't need hats, I HAVE SKINS!"
It's nice
Its a really Fun Game the Drops are amazing :D
great and action packed fun 
This game is free. This game is fun. Get this game.
Became a wizard after spending thousands of dollars on this game.  10/10
You're insane if you have a steam account but don't have this.
"Rocket jumps, sandviches, ham shanks, and HATS, SO MANY HATS.  111111/10"
This is not just a game... it's a lifestyle....
It sure is swell being killed by all the VIP players on servers.
its a great f2p do reccomend to people who dont have it
"Welp, What do I say? 1,154 hours (As of Writing the Review) and still playing. The game has a very balanced very fun easy to join casual servers and a non-valve competitive mode once you're ready to take it to the next level. It's got a wonderful workshop with many different custom maps and media. There's many different community gamemodes once you've gotten past the originals to! I hope my review was helpful and I hope you all get the game, Thanks and Play on!"
It's pretty okay.
This game used to be fun
hillariously fun and crazy! its a perfect shooter for any gamer
"This is without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played.  Speaking from experience, being a new player can be a little difficult,  But practice makes perfect, and the more you play, the more you adjust, learn, and get used to everything.   I have spent hours and hours playing this game, and I think the number of hours in itself should show you how entertaining this game is. "
"TF2 is a great game with perfect balancing, classes, and gameplay. It is fun and has a variety of gameplay so you never bored playing the same game. I personally have 500+ hours into it and I still get excited everyday to play this game. Now there will be times where you will think you suck while the other team is destroying you, dont give up. There is a chance that you will get Random Crits, a medic, or even a teamwork team in the next game. The community maps are phenominal and every single one I have played on was full of activity, there will be people who mic spam but you can use that mute button for good use. Now, you do not need to buy anything, I cannot stress that enough because you get all of the weapons for free by just playing the game. Most of the items are cosmetics or guns that make your eyes go crazy but all you really need is the weapons. People think that if they dont buy anything they dont feel like they are a part of the community, which in fact they are. Free 2 Play is a thing I have wanted to do from day one just to show F2P's aren't always noobs who dont know how to play the game. I of course bought things because I thought it would be so cool for my scout to have a hoodie, but then I got bored and bought more cosmetics. All I have to say is, have fun, play fair, and dont feel like you are left out not buying things. Be the first person who plays this game for 1000+ hours with only the weapons you find and we will all praise you."
"Great game, epic. Must have for any FPS player. Fun, easy to learn, and time consuming."
Its Like A Acid Trip
I really like this game because of fun gameplay.
The diversity makes it a truly unique game. I reccomend that you try it out.
Best f2p multiplayer fps. I recommend it for everyone. 10/10
This game is totally worth playing. Although you might get laughed at for being a f2p player but it is still worth it the community is definitely friendly!!!!!!
"a very good free to play first pearson shooter,a must have for anyone who is a fps fan"
"This game is so much fun! There are lots of achievements to do if you like getting achievements, and there are lots of different modes you can play too. The one thing I don't like about it is that you have to buy almost everything."
Addicting game. Pretty easy to spend money on too. Basically the downfall of a social life :D.
"Great fps, Really like the well thought out characters and their backstories. "
"my favorite game ,very intresting game i love to kill other players and get good drops ,best thing is trading with other  team fortress 2 players ."
Has Hats &amp; Sandwich's nuff said....

Its a hat simulator with a first person shooter minigame
I like this game because it is fun to play with friends. I like to spend on hats and really really like to play on tour of duty and Coop like MVM and stuff. So sit down relax and chill and get Team Fortress 2.      FREE TO PLAY
Very fun game. Very nice hats. Very nice. VARY VARY NICE. Besides it friggin free.
i cant kill please fix 
Awesome F2P game
one of the best games
skin simulator 2016 funni and original
Is good game. Play it. Buy hats. Get good.
what is team fortress 2 team fortress is a fps game made by valve i recommend this game beacuse its fun to play its also free and first when i started i got my first hat the gibus then ive been playing the game i found out the big updates that are coming are free but however the hats came in and made me just spend money over them but now its fun to play the hats everything is just great you can screw around in random server or you can play on real maps and use teamwork to win or you can be trading in trade servers and also try funny and awesome stop like airshots and double kills and more thats what i have to say about this game its free 2 play so go check it out :D
  This is such a great game. I've been spending my 3000 hours of life here and spending probably alot of money. 10/10.
"Amazingly fun game, free to play as well! Had many fun moments with this when I bought it on console and now it's even better on PC with items and all sorts! :)"
"I'd say that it ruined my life, but before Team Fortress 2, I didn't have a life. 5 Stars."
This game is too pro 4 me.
if you DONT have this game yet then you have wasted your life
An amazing FPS that's really addictive! It's a very well built shooter with a trading aspect that's free to play. I'd say it's better than the Call of Duty Franchise.
Nobody plays the actual game. All they care about is hats with pruple text that are on fire. 10/10 would reccomend.
"This game is possibly one of the greatest F2P games ever. However, once you reach that premium level, the game only gets better. Starting the game out, people do not realize the potential that they have. They look at their inventories, see the stock items placed in the slots, and connect to the first payload game that they find. And so the journey begins on TF2. But with only .50 cents in your steam wallet, you can unlock all the secrets of TF2. Purchasing their first wrangler opens them up to the world of hats, trading, and of course, unusuals. When a newly found premium player gets his first key, he opens up the crate that had no use before this. The suspense is killing him... 3... 2... 1... You unboxed! Strange Jarate! Not knowing the dissapointment in this. The player screams with excitement about getting a strange! Selling this strange for 1 rec turns into buying another, and getting a ref. This ref turns into a key. And the key into a bud. Now, you are a veteran of TF2 trading. However, with new updates coming every so often (BREAAD), new oppurtunites are created, and the game of Team Fortress get even better."
I reccomend this game because it is very fun and a great team based game. All my friends play this game every day and I think you should too.
Good game for good people
"700 hours later: 1 hat drop, 528303 crates."
Who doesn't love a little of tf2.
its the best game ever 
I wouldnt have used 1000+ hrs on my life on this thing if it wasnt good..
play this ♥♥♥♥
"A ton of weapons, a ton of hats and cosmetics, very fun to play and try to build a setup that you like. You drop the items as you play but trading is pretty big in this game.  In fact, it feels like a FPS/RPG hybrid now, I like it. Also, the fact that each class can be really powerful when mastered is pretty awesome."

This game is appropriate for the young and the old; and innapropriote for everyone else.
A game about hats.
"Awesome game! Skills! Get good, get Skills! Forget about the hat! Play, and enjoy! Keep Snipin'!"
"Not the best game in the world but A 100,000,000,000,002 times beest than CoD GHOSTS (Infinity ward its clear you suck balls) but TF2 has become well hard to believe BETTER! you dont have to be a heavy trying to kill a enemy medic for half an hour anymore -_-!But be sure to give it a try you also dont need an ACE pc to play it!"
dont play dis game its silly n about hats or sumthin idk
Is good.     All hail Gabe an Ewel and the Hatz
"If you dont have this game, THAN WHY ARE YOU EVEN ON STEAM. best multiplayer game ever that gets the term Team right\ 10/10"
"TF2, prob. the best Multiplayer game out there, it's F2P and is one of my favs. I love it. How about you?"
I need a life
You can throw urinade on other people.
Hats. Chaos. Infinite fun. nuff said
"There is literally no reason why you shouldn't play this game. I don't give a damn if your hard drive is almost filled up, delete something and download this IMMEDIATELY!"
"Amazing FPS + STEAM game in general, always my #1"
"From my 1500 hours of playing tf2, I can say it's my favorite game of all time. It never gets boring like other games, like COD. And I'm not gonna be quitting for a very looooong time, and I don't even think I will ever want to quit."
"Hat, Hoovy, Tryhard, Phlog Fotress 2, Star Wars The Phlog Awakens, Phlog Is Love Phlog Is Life."
Tf2 is life &lt;3
Its adicting? Yes.  Its fun? Hell yeah!
best game ever 10 outa 10
This Game is totally completely and utterly EPIC! P.S  Sandvich.
Very 'hat' Such 'trade'
"This game is awesome it has allot of fun into it and recently there is a lot of HATS, yes there is cosmetics, weapons, tools, and also if you are intrested then what are you waiting for get Team Fortress 2 and go enjoy it."
Best 15GB you can have. It has hats and scrap too!
"Absoulutely great game, No P2W formula here. Great gameplay and cartoony graphics, it is definetly worth a try!"
"Free to play first person shooter, what do you want? just try it! It's FREE!"
"A great game. But the only defection is that it tends to lag, and, sometimes, a lot."
This game is the best free shooter out there. 
This is a very obnoxious game that clutters space in my library and my fast access list.
Hat-collecting Simulator. The First. It's from Valve. It's also free - no excuse.
"Great game,great trading..and more..."
"Conga, Hats, and bird heads that everyone seems to hate, but the sniper, because he loves being an owl. This is tf2."
"Well were to start. Its an MMO 1st person shooter with good graphics for a 2007 game. Thats all you need to know considering the fact that there are more guns then the past 4 COD games and thepast 3 Halo games combined. And the crate unlooting system is op because if you do get the EXTREMELY small chance for a unusual item, you can get at least $20 for it. So yeah games good, good graphics, and a AMAZING looting system. 10/1"
"Great hat simulator. Much better then valves first hat simulator, Team Fortress, which had no hats"
One of the best games i have ever played its great for new players because its Co-Op and it verry funny when i first seen it i thought this game is stupid 5 mins later im up 24-7 (Not really) So ya best game i have ever played in my life :D

great for aesthetic people
I cant belive they made this awesome game free! but download it! i had 2 pay for it NOW ITS FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love this game never gets old
This game is great with updates and a lot more to be entertained with!
"Yeah, 671.9 hrs later, it was a good game"
"I have wasted a lot of time, money, and energy on not being good at this game, making weird outfits for fully grown, fictional men, and making sandwiches and chocolate bars into metal so I could be rich according to a made-up currancy.  10/10 would recommend to everyone. Soak this game into every corner of your life."
One of the best 'free to play' games ever made
"Great game, definitely worth downloading."
This free to play game cost me more than 60 dollar games.
Sold me bkpk fir 100 crets 10/10 wuld tread agerrn.
10/10 not enough ♥♥♥♥ing hats though
"this game ruined my life and made me angry at everything ever and i can't stop playing it, 20/10 would buy bills hat again"
It keeps crashing but i love the game -_-
that game is awesome and you have to download it
"Team Fortress 2 is a game of which I have spent many hours playing. It is one of the best (if not best) games I have ever played, and I highly recommend to anybody looking for a challenging yet fun shooter to play on the weekends.   Not only does it have 9 unique classes to chose from, each of which counter each other, and each of which are equally fun to play. I personally enjoy playing as the Soldier, Scout, and Medic.   There are (currently) 9-10 diferent types of game modes to choose from, including but not limited to Capture the Flag, Payload Race, and my personal favourite, 'MvM - Mann vs. Machine'.  I love this game, and always will, for the hats. You can customize your character to look like a paedophile, a horrifying deer-horned monster, or a balding russian man in his 40s.  It also has a good trading community, where I met many of my friends that I still talk to today.  I highly recommend this game to anybody looking for a fun new FPS to try out."
"Basically cocaine on a pixel screen to me!!  Great gameplay, great fun, great community, constantly finding weird and hilarious things in game! Seriously can't stop playin this game since like 3 yrs ago  Constant new updates that are really fun. Idk if i'll ever stop playing this game  (1 Problem - there will ALWAYS be a 12-yr old rage quit kid on every server or 2)  GET HATS ♥♥♥♥♥♥ES"
Found a hat and killed my friend with a fish 10/10
really awesome game
I would like to fight a bigger robot! :)
"It works, worth playing, it's free."
Two words Play it!!!!
"Team Fortress 2 is an enjoyable, fun-for-all experience with a unique take on the shoot genre. Each class is well-designed and balanced and allows the player to customize to their heart's content to find their style. No two games are alike!"
"The community's going crazy over 2 classes, quickplay is dead, and my brother walked into a casual queue and i haven't seen him in over 2 days, he's probably dead by now. Joke's on me because i put 6k hours from 2012 to 2016 into this game."
"Yes, i do recommend for all. Its excited nd fascinating"
"I recomend a lot this game cause it gives countless hours of fun, i hope you survive the people who say to you f2p."
I'm a fat Engineer and then a Pyro who acts like a Spy.   11 Archimedes out of 10
"good game, loads of fun"
"This game is beautiful. It has many maps and gamemodes, especially in the community itself. Whenever you get tired of maps like Capture the Point, you can play maps that are like 'Capture the Intel', or 'Mann vs Machine.'  If you get bored of all the default Valve gamemodes, you can start playing custom community made maps and gamemodes. It is a very flexible game, which is most likely why it has lasted so long. All in all, I would rate it 10 out of 10.  I recommend this game to almost every gamer to try out."
"This game requires the use of a credit card, disposable income, and/or hacks to earn street cred. 109/100 i wub it"
This is one of the best games of all time. I spend alot of time on here and not a second is wasted. there is lots of tradeing and fps stuff&gt; 
I litterally played saxton hale for 600 hours
I killed a guy with a shield and then headbutted a guy who had a giant eyeball for a head and then I got ♥♥♥♥ thrown on me. 10/10
"This is a truly outstanding game that everyone should have in their libraries, from the comical taunts to slaping an enemy with a fish, TF2 Has it all"
Stay as far away as you can. It will consume you before long.
this is like the best free to play steam game ever 10/10
"This game helped me find my path in life. It also lets me snap people's spines with boots by propelling myself via rockets. It also lets me stab people in the back and laugh at them. It lets me pretend I have a Boston accent while pummeling people with a frying pan. It makes me ponder the hard life and times of a black, Scottish cyclops. It lets me make ♥♥♥♥♥♥s mad with my 1337 h34d5h0t 5k1ll5. It lets me rage at a certain area-denial class. It lets me feel helpful by pointing a healy beam towards people with nice hats. It lets me huddah my huddah while reflecting huddahs' huddahs. It lets me be a giant Russian man with nothing but a sandwich and mittens, protesting violence."
Great game. Enjoy playing it with friends and some servers are very interesting.
"This is the most balanced, brilliant f2p game on PC. really."
this game is just so awsome totally recomend it 
This game is epic and addicting. The gameplay always changes which keeps it interesting for eternity. Best f2p game ever
"I love this game! doesn't matter if you're a girl, everyone can become good at this :D"
Everything was fine until the update. I've spent a long time playing this game and I think it's gonna stop because of this new update Do we really have to wait for a long time to find a match? Make TF2 great again. No to matchmaking. Ffs.
Wasted 1200+ hours of my life! Free money!
You want a game where comedy and combat clash together? BAM TF2
Great game. Constant updates and the diversity of the game means this is one that will keep you coming back for more. Highly addictive and definitly one that will grab a lot of your time. Its a completely fair game as there is no level up system and the only real way that players get an edge is through experience.
It's definitly worth to try this game. For me it's a fun multiplayer FPS game.
Very good for procastination. 10/10
"This is a well thought out team based first person shooter. The game encourages teamwork to win against players of higher skill or well-organized teams. Lone wolfing can still be done on lower levels, especially on public game servers.  There are 9 classes to choose from, each one offering unique skill sets and abilities that allow them to fill in a unique role as part of the team as a whole. Because of this, the player is rewarded with a challenging and fun-filled experience, especially when faced against opponents or teams with similar or greater skill.  Even though this game was released way back in 2007, the game continues to have an active development team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content, such as new unique weapons or game modes. At the time of this review, the Team Fortress community is preparing for the upcoming Halloween update, which has been an annual event in the game since 2009.  While this game is extremely fun and rewarding to play, I have noticed how complex the game has become in regards to new items and game mechanics. I became introduced to this game in 2011, and gradually learned the ropes of the game over time. However, I have noticed how newer players have reported having a hard time grasping how all of the items work and in general feeling a sense of information overload. In order for them to not be considered a 'noob' at this game, they must experiment and test with all of the items in the game to have a full understanding of what weapon(s) should be used in certain situations.  All of this, however, is a small issue amidst the big picture. This game is fantastic and, being a free-to-play game, allows players to have loads of fun without having to make a big down payment to enjoy it. I continue to return to the game on a daily basis."
"Good game,too bad that its needed original for tradeabale items..so its 7/10"
"hey im Zero_Thenik and this is what i think of Team Fortress 2. i love this game it has its ups and downs but still i love the gameplay and everything about the online action you make friends fight them trade them do whatever, there are also the downs where its like the tiny chance of getting the Australium guns (if you dont know what Austrailium gun are you can find out in the game trust me) but anyway enough of the Australium talk lets talk GUNS! yes you get alot of guns to choose from fo each loadout i have had my Machina (favorite sniper rifle) for a loooong time and i have used it in every round that i have played exept for the man vs machine (another gameplay that you can check out on the game screen) but yes i love all the weapons and all of that. i guess its about time to rap this up thanks for reading and i hope to see you all playing some time. im Zero_Thenik and i will see YOU in the game!"
"-plays game -has fun -thinks is good -realises is bad -depression -'oh, look! A hat!' "
I heard hats are better than the game.
"Great banter, it realy is!"
THE BEST F2P GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED!
"one of the best team-based shooters,with a pinch of misc items"
I loved this game when I first played it. It was an AMAZING game. I have met ALOT of friends from playing this game and I made alot of best friends. I got really good at this game. There have been some good times and bad times. But now... The community is decaying. This used to be a really good game when it first came out. But now.. its just not that good anymore. 4/10 I wish this game was good again.  R.I.P TF2 Community...
Free-to-Play Because it took your life as payment.
This is a very good game for people who like first person shooters and fast game play.It is also good for people who like to trade thier items.
"Great FPS, especially if you like class based FPSes. Much strategy involved and good class customization. And hats. HATS HATS HATS!"
TF2 is just a great game
game s0 c00l i w4nt3d d1s ♥♥♥♥ s0 b4444d like bruh yeah r8 5/7  byeee ly
THIS GAME IS BOSS AND I LOVE IT   I won't be quiting anytime soon
one question will we be able to play as my pauling in tf2 soon
i love this game 11/10. please make an uptade to give out more people hats and costumes. it makes me sad when i dont have anything
THIS GAME IS THE BOMB!
Yes I do recommend this game to others I know because most of my friends love FPS games. Of course at first I was a COD Player and I would always ask myself What the hell is this game but after a while of playing the game I have came to the conclusion.... I dont like it. I LOVE IT!
PROs: free fun customizable characters lots of weapons hats trading cards loads of maps lots of gamemodes events nothing pay 2 win huge community competitive gaming ------ CONs: ... i really can't think of a con.
ITS ALL ABOUT THE HATSSSSSSS MUST HAVE MORE HATSSSSSS
Team Fortress is one of the best F2P game  and it is made by Valve
the game is alright. it's fun to play and the community makes a lot of good things. but The crafting doesn't always work. I tried to craft a weapon with my haunted scrap but it refused to let me. it said that it had 'special properties'
great game
$13 for a sombrero.. ummm WORTH!!  10/10  Would but again
11/10 best hat sim
A really great fps to get into.
"Great game to play when your bored. Good for people looking for a less serious but equally enjoyable game. Big community lots of trading, Different gamemodes and maps to try out. Steam workshop support great content from there. I dont play it nearly as much as i used to but i have many memories and still recommend it to anyone. Was my first game on steam and that was 3 years ago. Good start for new people on steam too."
"Good game You will get free items This is not play to win game, because you just need skill here And this game funny"
"I've got to say I really enjoy this game. Its nice because it is free to play so you don't need to spend any money. If you are worried that it is pay to win, I can assure you that you will be able to get all weapons naturally without paying. There is a learning curve so when you first start playing you may find it hard, but if you stick to it, you will have a fun experiance."
its is a very fun game to play
Lots of fun if you're looking for a more laidback and lighthearted fps
Free to play games are expensive..
"Team Fortress 2 has the most balanced classes around with some being more for new players and others being for the more experienced. Take the sniper. The sniper is the easiest class in the game and it is extremely easy to use. It is recommended to try and shoot the body and not the head, as it does almost the same amount of damage. The pyro however, is almost impossible to master and the people who are able to use it well have been called w+m1-ers. This stands for win+medic1, because a pyro and a medic are almost unstoppable and can win the game if the pyro has any decent amount of skill. The heavy is also one of the harder class, and the win+medic1 also applies to it. There are many great game modes and maps, but I love deathmatch on 2fort myself."
♥♥♥ u volvo. this game is two spoopy. i get nitemayors naio
  It is the best game I ever played ! Characters are very cool and game modes are good for playing ! There is many weapons and you must downolad this also because is free play ! 😁😁😂👍👍👍👍👍👍 
"If you like games where the whole consept of the game is to play nice, then you came to the wrong place. Let me tell ypu, aside from the frequently lurking scammers and ear piercing ads on random servers, its the whole chat system that irritates my the most(not really, I just want people to read this). I mean really, am I REALLY just typing this review to complete a task in Steam? Or am I just bored at..oh...say...11:41 PM at f****** night!? I'm sorry, I know I might of scared the children there for a little bit but really, if you don't like this game, then you need to find a better way to store 1000 hats in a small back pack. And DON'T let me get you started on the trading system(not that theres anything wrong with it), but would you really pay 16 thousand flippin force-a-nature dollars for a hat that is practically on fire.(Ok...I might) But in the end, it all comes down to weather you like to wear hats that make you look cool in a videogame or if you like to wear hats in real life that make you look cool.Oh and crates.....those are just portals to Gabens neverending stockpile of money.Yep"
"This is the only game I play from Valve, so far, but it is quite addicting. The character development in general is supurb, the designs are always amusing, the community is usually pretty great (except for those Anti-girl-gamers, you know who you are!) I love that the player has the option to play offline or online. The customability of everything satisfies me, except I wish it would allow players to choose character gender. All In all I give it an 8/10, I'd give it 10/10 if the players could choose character gender, because honestly the Femme versions are all equally awesome too!"
I love this game!
pls help...... can't.... stop..... playing....
much wow. good hat. bad bod shot f2p snippies
i would always recommend this game i would have recommended it sincs my first download. The reason whhy i would recomend this is because its a fun first person shooter folr the younger kids. snipers a bit bad for kids but apart from that id say its 7+. 
"IF YOU HAVENT BEEN PLAYING THIS, THEN YOU UST HAVE BEEN LIVING UNDER A ROCK OR SUCKING CALL OF DUTYS DIK...OR BOTH. ANYWA, YOU PLAY AS CLASSES AND YOU GET HATS AND NEW WEPONS AND YOU FUKK SSHHIT UP AND THEN YOU LIKE A CREDIT TO TEAM AND THERE IS SO MUCH TEAMWORK ITS NOT EVEN FUNNY AND THEN YOU GET SHOT AND THEN YOU RESPAWN AND THEN THE CYCLE STARTS UP AGAIN, THIS GAME IS BALANCED...FUKKING COD PLAYERS"
"9/10,Greatest War-Themed Hat Simulator I've Ever Played"
It all love.
very cool and great 
it`s a very cool game 
0/10 worst game i ever play.  no sprint unfare wepins stopid mod where fite robots tht copyd cod zombys no iron sites hedshot isnt instant kil stoppid peeple using ivis hax also other peeple using invinsibly hax evrybody is ubsesed wit hats  0/100 cod is better
"If I had known hats were a viable currency, I would have saved the money of going to college and invested in TF2 merch sooner. I'm not sure if it's like doing crack, because I've never done crack. But hats are pretty addictive... So, take that as you will. I sold my desk to pay for hats now I game on my floor. 11/10"
"When one thinks of First Person Shooter, they think A Realistic game with Real life weaponry and Trolls (lul)  Team Fortress 2 inst that at all, it introduces a collection of Crazy weapons that if used in real life would be absurd. And keeps up with it's community adding new weapons or reskins of weapons with each update. and the maps are also well made and can even be added by the fans themselfs, you also get to be a little picky with choosing 9 different classes (Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy,Engineer, Medic, Sniper and spy). which have there own weapons exclusive to them. I'd reccomend this game for those who want to have a taste of a different First person shooter which adds more then what people would expect.  Now: the downside. The taunts for one seeing now theres a repetitive dance trend which has turned a whacky FPS into a whacky dance fest. the taunts kinda suck out the gameplay and there should rather be a time and place or...server. Another thing is the trolls in alot of FPS games there gonna a troll,Micspammer or kid on a game like this is also annoying and can really get you mad, TF2 has alot of those.  But aside from Taunt Trends and Trolls TF2 is a game which brings a new light to the FPS community."
"Pretty cool multiplayer game. Trading, Economy, Custom Gamemodes... +1"
perhaps we took games way too seriously  especially this game
"  Best ♥♥♥♥ing game created with best community, story, mechanics, balance, style, and company that made it all possible  Honestly there is always something within this game that can appeal to your taste in anyway just look for it dont give up on it."
nice game play
This game is very well balanced and fun
I cannot say how much this game means to me. It is awesome for loads of reasons. GET EVERY WEAPON IN THE GAME. Dress fancy and do your victory taunt. Its to amazing to ignore and its free. Every shooter fan will look at this game and be amazed for its infinate possibles. No person should ignore this game. I love the characters and how much blood there is. Thanks valve for Team fortress.
They must really put up a warning saying that TF2 ruins your social life.
"You install the game...and BAM, you become addicted. 10/10. Master piece!"
This game is one of the only good team based shooters out there... *ahem* CoD you are not
"It's amazing, like FPS(Not that I've even played FPS EVER...) beautiful strategy, nice weapons and so addicting!!!!!!"
Yes this gamenis amazing its funny cuz of the hats and name
"I really love this game and all its creativity plus the lively community! A active one that has tons of people continuosly making new weapons etc.  Though one thing we must all note, the community is kind of getting corrupted. The hackers are getting loose and scammers are just around ever corner. Even though the game itself is great, I just wish Valve can do somethine about the increasingly scray numbers of game ruiners.  Scammers aim for new players with pretty good weapons.  Besides that, the basic community idealogoy must be changed! P2P=best player X/ F2P=Noob, team downfall, blame taker X. I was F2P for 1yr and I experienced alot of critism during my time, at 1 point I even considered quitting the game totaly when I was kicked out of 3 servers in a row. I'll be honest, im not a bad player, I can top score or dominate as well as any P2P. But once that happens, you maybe even accussed of cheating! Hacking!  What kind of community has TF2 become? I remeber it was NEVER like this a few years back! In that time when hats didnt matter, people actually HELPED me! Yes they HELPED me!! Now? Sometimes I dress as a F2P just to see what happens...and the results dont suprise me.   Im giving a postitive rating only because Valve had put in much work into the GAME and I love playing the GAME. I got scamed twice! Both when i just got my P2P status. Lost $50 in total, and when I reported, I dont think Valve did anything against these 2 people.  Thats why im currently putting TF2 on hold.....The rating is for the GAME ONLY, the community........go and get yourself fixed before I say anything."
"git hats, git gud, git comp, git scammed, git sad, git mad, git donated, rpeat m8"
THIS IS A FUN GAME!
This game is more of a hat simulator than a FPS.  +1
"Good, all in one free games. Just expecting for offline lan play to added with last known player inventory without an internet connection though."
"So much fun , even when you get bored of the normal gmae you can pick up trading. Thank you Valve for the awesome game"
I love it.
Forever an awesome game
"Like its predecessors, Team Fortress 2 is focused around two opposing teams competing for a combat-based principal objective.In the game's fiction, the teams are composed of mercenaries hired by two feuding brothers to protect the company assets belonging to one brother while trying to destroy those of the other; the teams are thus represented by the names of these companies: Reliable Excavation &amp; Demolition (RED) and Builders League United (BLU). Players can choose to play as one of nine character classes in these teams, each with his own unique strengths, weaknesses, and weapons. Although the abilities of a number of classes have changed from earlier Team Fortress incarnations, the basic elements of each class have remained, that being one primary weapon, one secondary weapon, and one melee weapons.The game was released with six official maps, although 44 extra maps, 9 arena maps, 8 king of the hill maps, and various other map types have been included in subsequent updates.In addition, a number of community assembled maps have been released. When players join a level for the first time, an introductory video shows how to complete its objectives."
"My logged hours may not reflect it but I've been with this game for what seems like the dawn of time. I paid for my copy back in.... 2009 I think... after playing it countless times at the local gaming cafe. It's a great and 'simple' FPS with a pretty decent community. I mean every community has ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s but for the most part, it's been amazing! I'm a pretty vanilla player. I don't craft. I don't care about hats. I don't care if I have a weapon that's something other than 'normal'. But if you're into that, it's crazy how extensive that side of things is. I just like to get lost for hours on some random map, depending on my mood, and go at it. Always Team Red suckas!   It's easy to pick up and go but it's complicated enough that even after all these years of playing, I discover some new tactic or achievement I can get or do a thing I didn't know I could do. For the most part, everything is pretty balanced and each class really does hold his own as well as aide in combat. You can either be a badass and go off on your own or work with your team to use each other to achieve victory. That is something I really appreciate.   Also, let's just talk about maps/game modes for a sec. The traditional are just as great as what the community makes. I think it's cool that you can have your own server and build your own map. I know I have enjoyed several rounds of Dodgeball, Prop Hunt, and whatever that Slenderman, Weeping Angel, other horror people game mode things are. Also, if you haven't, there's a Mario Kart server that is just super silly and chill. I recommend checking that one out in particular.   The only thing I absolutely hate is the ridiculous and/or random trading requests in the middle of battle which I suppose is more about the players than the game. I really just wanna play and not worry about 2954 pings from 'HerpaDerp1234' distracting me from taking down the other team. Can you wait til set-up or PM me so we can trade after the match or when we are done playing if you are THAT desperate for whatever I have? Come on man...   All in all, it's a great time killer. It has a great amount of variety depending on how you like to play and it's super fun. I reccomend this to everyone no matter the type of video game you like playing."
"2014, Conga Simulator 2014 2015, Now the life of skin in boxing BEGINS 2016, Phlog Simulator 2016: Dawn of the Doom of Spys"
"ElectronJake Score - 'Highly addicting, a must play.'  Traditional Score - 9/10  To be honest, Team Fortress 2 does multiplayer first person shooters the right way. That's all it is. No campaign, no sugarcoating, just pure multiplayer goodness. A mulitude of game modes and servers makes it incredible fresh each time you play, and it's very much a community driven game. It also has 9 different classes to choose from, which I consider to be the highlight. Creating builds for these classes is awesome. I love how all the different play styles are DIFFERENT. Not everyone is run and gun, which is a positive for me. The game is truly a 'team' game. No solo work. Each class is important in some way. And as I said earlier, the classes are extremely customizable. Each class has a primary, secondary,and melee weapon, though some have other things, such as the Engineer's buildings, or the Spy's stealth based moveset.  The best part about TF2 is that it is free to play. PLUS it's free to play done right. You can pay for inventory items, which change up gameplay considerably, but they're not required. You can get plenty of weapons through random trades. A robust economy and trading system compliment what seems to be a barebones shooter. With a couple of friends, this game turns into massive fun."
"What can I say. It's Team Fortress, how can anybody don't love it. It's funny, enjoyable and you can play many different maps with different goals. And the biggest advantage it's bloody FREE!"
7.8/10 too many hats
very Well Planned Game With Many funny items and gestures and one thing that changes it all......can you guess? HATS! Anyways there is nothing wrong with it and its perfect i strogly suggest you give it a try :)
"Tf2 will never let you down. Its funny, obnoxious and lethal. Ofcourse i recommend the game, since its enjoyable fir anyone that likes fun and 'commandos'"
"If you are a steamer ,this is a musthave"
"It's like eating candy. You eat tons and you enjoy it, and then you get fat and explode.  10/10 would get scammed again."
"After god knows how many hours of playing this game, it is my personal and profesional opinion that you should not play this game. While I do recomend this game 10/10, you should not play this game unless you are willing to waste all your time and money on weapons and more likely, hats. You have been warned."
"Once upon a time, I've spent more than $70 in one night. And got hats and cosmetics.  10/10"
You want me to give you a review? You'll GET ONE.                         Hats!                More Hats!               Even More!                  A hat with a side of hat with a hat drink and hat fries and with a hat on the go!                                         11/10 -IGN
It's the game for hat addicts. also enjoyable as well.
"Super fun FPS to play with friends or against bots! 9 Classes to play as, lots of weapons and HATS! This game is all the hype and you need to play it! There are so many hats in the game! Become Premium (buy something from Mann Co Store) to become Premium and trade! Trading is half the fun! You get to trade HATS! GET THIS NOW!"
awsome game!endless fun and opertunity!!!!
"Awesome game with variety of items and addictive gameplay!! +:  Enormous amount of items   Addictive gameplay   Interesting play modes, halloween maps^^  -:  Sometimes boring   Sometimes players are impudent (spawnkills, teleporters directly to base). But it is part of gameplay and you can't play with much joy witht it.  "
This game is good.
vary fun game it can get laggy but it is still fun 
a great game my friend plays it its great that i can find other people with special needs to be friends with and enjoy
TF2 is an amazing game and I have gotten the most mileage out of it. TF2 is not pay to win and that is one of the things that is fantastic about it. Class diversity is a good part too.

"I've spent over 2,000 hours (give or take with idle) and I must say it is single handedly the best game for a free to play to pick up. It has 9 diverse classes and an easy to pickup combat system, aswell as that tons of different game modes for players to use. As well as being so diverse, the game has endless fun and humour aswell as a insanely high skill level that I would say would be almost impossible to master. Whether its a scouts hit-scanning ability or a soldiers ability to airshot fluently or just an engineer's sentry placement the hours you invent so master these skills leaves anyone on their toes and wanting to play more. I definetely rate this game a 10/10 and recommend it to anyone."
It's free. You have no reason not to download it. Do so. You will be forever grateful.
"I recently got myself a Steam account just to play this game, and I gotta say, it's worth it.   Pros: -One of the few FPS out there with a personality -Unique and consistantly artistic visual -Fun yet competitive team mechanics -Diversed and balanced classes, giving the player many ways to support team objectives  -There is NONE of that pay to win bulls**t! Default items are just as effective as paid ones depending on the situation because there will always be a trade off.  Cons: -Some classes and mode have a learning curve that does not appeal to common sense. -Luck is a factor since critical damage comes and go randomly. -Individual skills are not nearly as focused in this game when compared to games like CS:GO, which can be a turn off if you're the lone wolf type.  Recommandation? Definitely! This is one of the most creative FPS ever made, and it's a shame if you still haven't played it by far. GET THIS GAME NOW!"
"Alright, last time I did a review for this game I had roughly little to no expierence with it. Now that Ive packed roughly six thousand (6000) hours into this game I think Im ready to put in a REAL review.  Note this is a personal review, so there will be plenty of bias since its all online and there isnt much 'story element' to go off of. Anyways lets get this party started.  Team Fortress 2 is a class based multiplayer shooter with plenty of maps and objective based game modes to play. I could sit here and tell you about each class indivudially but then it wouldnt really be a review, it would be more of a detailed look at the game, which isnt really what Im going for. Putting it simply, you pick either RED or BLU and click and shoot. Pretty simple right? Well I would hope so, lets skip into the pros and cons shall we?  Pros:  This game is fun, mostly with friends. With plenty of pub servers (public) which are Valve servers. They are the most basic of basic servers and have no plug ins or add ons or anything like that.  Plenty of servers to choose from. Again, from Valve servers to the simple orange servers and custom map servers there are plenty of servers to go play on. Servers will return on the cons list so keep an eye out for that.  Weapons! There are plenty of weapons to choose from that could either be situational, or go towards a player with skill. An example of a 'skill' weapon would be the Direct Hit as it rewards soldiers who are able to hit the target directly instead of going for splash damage. The Bazaar Bargain is also rewarding to Snipers who can get headshots constantly. Spy's knife is also a bit of a skill weapon as it can deliver backstabs which insta-kill. Plenty of weapons to choose from, however stock weapons (or vanilla) are usually the best.  The biggest pro I can think of right now is the hats. Yes I know that people put hats above all else in this game, such as the better your hats are, the better at the game you are. However thats only a simple sterotype going around in the community. Unusuals being the 'top teir' hats due to the partical effect they offer. Why is this a pro you may ask? Well its kept the game alive for the most part. With the lack of weapons, maps and game mods, hats seem to be keeping this game afloat and lets be honest here. Some hats arent too god awful.   Alright boys and girls here we go, lets move onto the cons.  Cons:  The community. Yes, the community. Whats so wrong with the community you may ask? Well the first give-away shouldve been the hats sterotype. Of course that was a community thing and theres a few other things Ill cover. The first being the Lenny face meme. If you're like me you hate the thing and dont find it funny. However from my play-time Ive noticed I cant go a single pub game without finding someone who loves to spam it. Now Im not a big fan of 'memes' myself so anything like 'get rekt' or 'skrub' is enough to annoy me, but moving on the majority of people who use Lenny are self-entitied ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who think they are better than everyone else. Another issue with the community is all the ♥♥♥♥ talk I see and hear every game. I dont know who said it first, but a certain phrase says it best : Its a hat simulator, not a hate simulator. However it seems like a decent portion of the community is half-decent. Shying away from this, lets move on.   Hats. Like I said, they came back. People seem to put their cosmetics before the game. Acting like if they have a certain hat or unusual they are some kind of demi-god at the game. Same goes for weaponry reskins such as Festives and Australiums. However this isnt always the case, some people with these are actually decent, if not pro at the game...actualy lets mix weapons into hats as well. Some weapons are literally just cosmetics themselves. So here we go! Weapons: Well like I said with unusuals, if they have a Festive or Australium the player might think themself a demi-god at the game. This also mixes into the community but Ill keep it here. Another problem with weapons is that instead of adding new weapons to the game, we get constant reskins. They can be nice at first, but I would like a weapon with new stats to try out. &lt;--- Bias, am I right guys?  Hackers. Ok look guys, this is the biggest issue next to scammers, sharks, and other trade terms. Sure, TF2, like a good other portion of Source games, run the VAC system. However, it is slower than a snail stuck in tree sap. Me and my friends were on a Valve server and we dealt with a hacker for several rounds before he, himself, left. No he was not voted off, no he was not kicked by the team he was on. He. Left. Himself. Six straight rounds of a hacker. Now ignoring my pity story, hackers ruin the game. They ruin it for the team they fight, the team their on, and just the game in general. I can think of about 4 hacks. Invisibility, wall hacks, aimbot, and trigger bot. Sure theres more, but still. Hackers can ruin this game.   Overall Id give this game 9/10. Hackers and the community really take away from the game, but its fun none the less. I recommend it for people new to steam, or for someone looking for a fun F2P game that isnt P2W."
A game literally made me laugh because of bread. Wat.
I havent seen my friends and family for years. I have wasted all of my money on this game. I collect hats. I may have an addiction to medic. I havent been to school in how long now? I played for about three years now and I still suck balls at it. Overall its just really fun so I don't really care 11/10 IGN
THIS GAME IS THE BEST OF THE WORLD
"  What can I say. A first person shooter with a class to suit anybody, all with unique and funny personalities and gameplay mechanics that are fun to utilise and easy to learn. You really can't ask for more from a game which you can download for free! (But this doesn't mean that I don't hate Spy's...)"
this is a fun first person shooter and multiplayer game where you can test ur skill and find new weps and hats to try new stuff out
...Need more class.
"If you want to have most fun online , just download this game!!"
"This is possibly one of the best games ever made. I give it a 10/10, mostly because of it's great community, great gameplay, and long lifetime. This game has been going for 9 whole years. And in that time, it has made intense improvements. Even on older and slower computers, you can set settings to make it pretty enjoyable. Every gamemode and every aspect of the game is great. I'm happy to see it have come such a long way."
This is is the reason why my grades have dropped in Maths -.- And I'm Asian so this is very disgraceful.
Great game.
"It's alright, it should be the first free game for everyone but it could be heavily improved if they had better game modes, more realistic weapons (such as machine gun), and if nothing costed money in-game. It would be a BIG NO if this game wasn't free otherwise you would pay for the game, then spend $100 in-game."
10/10 would play
"This game is a great multiplayer experience! I remember hating TF2. But my friends got me to try it out, and I fell in love with it! It's free to play, but if you're still hesitant to download it because of it's estimated download time, don't worry because Steam overestimates the time it takes to download. I remember downloading it took 30 minutes to 1 hour when the estimation said 7 hours. Either way, you can either play in team matches with friends, or random people who happened to be on the server. I prefer the Co-Op mode, Mann VS Machine. In Mann VS Machine, you can team up with friends, or random people as i said. It's pretty much a Human Team against AI Robots. The Human Team wears a red color, and Robots, blue. What i really like about Mann VS Machine is that you can buy upgrades. You get a certain amount of money before the game starts, and you can buy upgrades with it. After the game starts, whenever you kill a Bot, they drop a certain amount of money depending on how tough the bot was. Then, it's a race to ge the money first! I like upgrading the heavy from slowest class, to middle slowest. Either way, TF2 is worth your download time. It can't be worth yuor money because it's free to play. All joking aside, I really like, this game, and once you give it a try, you'll love it!"
"If you have not played this game yet, you are missing out and what is one of the greatest MMO games out there. Valve, whatever you did to this game, you did right."
BEST GAME IN STEAM!
Fun FPS game I would total recommoned it to just about anyone.
"fun shooter, do not judge this book by its cover. With balance of chaos and fun this is a good first shooter for anyone."
Best hat simulator ever!! 1000000/10
First games that says hats are more important than anything.
Very addicting and funny in a way PLAY IT! IT'S FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111111111!1!!!!!111!!!!!!111!!!
"This game, is awesome, very flippin awesome, there are tons of weapon choices, each with their own effects. The classes have a ton of personality which really makes them shine. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes shooters."
10/10 Good Game passes time quick Amazing FPS
10/10 best game ever spy crab approves
"This game is pretty awesome if you like action games / fun games. Get weapons, craft and many other things! Just awesome!"
i havent really played it enough yet to give it a fair review but its pretty good
"Awesome Free to Play game! Encourages teamwork and strategy. Includes a 9-class-based team combination selection, and each with a specific counter. Work together with team mates to defeat the other team! And aside of all the fun, the trading experience is amazing! Dont be afraid to send me a   Trade Offers ⇄ !"
It's ok I guess.
Really fun with guns
"Do I even need to add a review to the sea of them down here? Heck yes I do! TF2 is the most fun, most intresting, most time-consuming game I have ever played, to this date. This game is frikin' unbelievable. Do not even read on until you have downleaded this FREE game. Go on, I'll wait.  ... Done? Let me tell you about the game you have just downloaded. Oh boy it is so very fun! Quick quiz- You bought Half Life 2, Portal 2, Borderlands, and Overgrowth in the Steam Summer sale. Which game do you play first? TF2, baby! This game will keep you coming back for more with it's rich multiplayer experience. There are tones of great weapons to choose from, ranging from a rainbow flamethrower that kills enemies with a sparkly shine, to a small knife that will instantly kill an enemy from behind. And who could forget, HATS! TF2 is the full out hat simulator of the year! There are so many hats to play with that do absolutely nothing at all for you, but still makes you feel superior to those with the bald heads. Even more, there are 9 really fun classes with different play-styles, from the zooming fast scout, to the sneaky, disguising, invisible, backstabbing spy. What are you waiting for? Play it now, and you can watch a sniper get his head chopped off by a charging scottish man wielding a 5 foot sword, all while eating a sandwich (sandvich) as fat, Soviet man. This game is the best, ever."
has hats
"when i saw the beta trailer for this game back in 2006 on G4's X-play i relized this isnt ur average fps game. no, its also very shiny looking and has dark ♥♥♥ shadows. i atched youtube vids on it for years and years untill i got my decent laptop a year ago. i now have 2,003 yrs team fortress to this day. tf2 and killzone are the funnest games ive every played! they are both multiclass fps games. thanks valve!"
I recommend this because its really fun to play with friends and its free! :D
Awesome game :3 :3 but my pc can't hanldle it. So lag
this is the best conga based hat simulator DOWNLOAD IT!!!
This game is just. AMAZING! Best FPS Game Ever.
Nice FPS hat simulator :)!
"I would very reccomand this game for people who like first person shooters and stratergy games due to the fact of the variety of gamemodes, it can keep people addicted for hours on end! Also, the game classes are very balanced and diffrent classes work better against other classes then other! Also, the communiy isnt that bad and you will find hardely any hackers in this because of there VAC system which can make servers safe from hackers. Alltogether, I rate this game 10/ 10 because of its awesome gameplay balanced classes good loot system, and the fact that it has a ginourmaus varity of gamemodes! Would reccomand for any first person shooter or a person who likes the mess around and kill!"
"Tons of fun for the whole family, if your family likes playing Team Fortress 2. Very adicting. Love the newest event, Gun Mettle. Its has been fun to work on completing the contracts. A buddy and I have also been working together to get different achievements and this has added another level of fun to the game. Highly recomend this game!"
"TL;DR  10 / 10  Download Now.  EDIT: Removed long unecessary review, filled with nonsense."
"After nine years in devolopment, it was worth the weight."
"I love this game, its funny and u can also trades which makes that u can explore new weapons and get cooler with hats and also make profits on itesm"
"A very nice, competitive game. You can choose bnetween the competitive game mode and the co-op game mode, which is a very nice touch. Very ncie game overall, woudl recommend :)."
"Fun Cartoony FPS game, Even more fun with friends!"
Definitely would recommend this game. I mean it is free and you can beat it being free. I've never been a person really into first person shooters but this game is the exception. Something about it is so fun and addicting. 10/10 would recommend.
"I love this game, its really addictive and i would recommend this."
"Do you like sitting, congaing, and shooting things? then  Team Fortress 2  is the game for you. anything you can dream of you can do. and HAT HAT HAT HAT HAT HAT HAT HAT HAT HAT HAT HAT HAT HAT HAT HAT HAT HAT HAT HAT HAT  "
This game died when they updated it.
This game is rate good
"i Like This Game, i'm 5 Years playing this game"
Absolutely fantastic.
bloody and super fun
"Action packed, crazy cartoon fun! I would reccomend this game to anyone looking for comedy, guns and gore! The community is great. The weapons are great. The hats are halarious! 7/10"
"Ruined my life, and my bank account. 11/10 would pootis again"
I like to be the medic.
"This game kicks ♥♥♥ in more ways then 7. What more can I say, after all, 7 different kinds of ♥♥♥ kicking is enough to buy the game- BUT WAIT, IT'S FREE!! Team Fortress 2 is one of the most played games on Steam and it's not a surprise. It's a FPS with a cartoon-like twist! The more and more you play it the more and more you unlock new things. After a while you just get so caught up into it and BOOM. No life :3. But in all seriousness, I highly reccomend this game for it's extreme balance between players. It doesn't matter if you're a F2P or a P2P, the weapons are always equal. The cosmetics however... different story. All in all, 10/10 stop reading this and go get Team Fortress 2! See you online :L"
nice game competitive and cool I recommend the game Trust Me
" Team Fortress 2 is one of the first games I have ever played in Steam.   Presenting: Hat Simulator where guillable people spend more money on virtual hats than there real-life form! RED vs. BLU battle it out to get more land than their brother, and they hire 9 useless mercs to do it for them!  What Redmond and Blutarch doesn't know is that RED and BLU are actually not doing anything because of the Conga and Kazotzsky Kick hype, which will eventually die out. (｀・ω・´)”     hets. "
"A hat simulator, FPS w/ countless of weapons and equipment and 9 classes to choose from. Each class can outplay the any other if they have the skill to do so. Each class is fair and balanced and have their own abilities to make them unique. New game modes, maps and updates make this game fun and relevant."
I love this game its the best game ive ever played thanks valve
Really Fun If U Played other Fps Game u will have experience 
"I've never been particularly fond of multiplayer shooters. From my limited experience, they have this intial rush that feels pretty good, but that feeling slowly fades to leave behind a bleak and dry experience. They just seem to lack the engaging elements that singleplayer games have and use so well.  That's not the case with Team Fortress 2 though. This game is  fun . Not only is the gameplay deep, intuitive and interesting, but it also accentuates the style, and the style accentuates it. The characters are surprisingly fleshed out, and I would recommend reading some of the comics.  Overall, give it a go."
"I don't even know how to start this. I'll just dive in to the monster that Valve has created with this new update.  This latest update has completely broken the game. It takes upwards of 25 minutes just to get in to a match, which, I may add, you cannot choose the map anymore because that of course, was such a detriment to the game *Sarcasm*. But, that, of course, is if you can even get in to the matchmaking system, I currently have an error message popping up on all matchmaking AND training matchmaking things basically saying 'Hey uh... one of our systems is broken, You can't play TF2 right now... have fun!' Really Valve? When I CAN get in to a matchmaking queue, it takes forever. But that's only about half the time. On top of that, quickplay has been replaced with casual mode. Casual mode penalizes you if you leave in the middle of a match... really? Well no more 'Oh I want to play a quick round of Team Fortress 2 before I go do something.' Well then. Oh, and a minor complaint is the new ranking system in Casual. Why do we need a ranking system? BECAUSE WE WANT YOU TO PLAY COMPETITIVE, ♥♥♥♥FACE! I'm not even gonna get in to the problems with the gameplay right now. That ♥♥♥♥ is a whole other can of worms. So yeah. Valve has promised to fix all the issues but right now, I still can't play the ♥♥♥♥ing game. You know, Team Fortress 2 used to be that one game. You know the one. Among all the ♥♥♥♥, it was there. Standing proud in your steam library. The one you would think about all day long while at school or work. Then when you finally got home, you got on your computer and played it for hours. Sure, the community was ♥♥♥♥ and by the end of the night, you've produced enough hate to sate the entirity of the internet for the rest of the year, but you would come back as soon as possible to play it once again. Now, I can't even get in to the damn thing. So this is directly to you, Valve. Please. Please god, don't ♥♥♥♥ it up more. Let me actually play the damn game. Please. Fix everything. There are a million other reviews up right now that will say the same thing with a different coat of paint. We, the community, love your game. We love your company (However ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at customer support and listening to your fans you may be). Listen to us and fix the ♥♥♥♥ing game. "
An awesome game with a decent community (if you know where to look :P)  can be played either competetive or casualy  I'll update this review if i find a game that i think is better than TF2.  10/10 for me ;)   ...oh yea you get hats    ...lots of hats
I Say This To You If you Are Reading This Gabe: THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS GAME! The Best FPS I Played In 2014 - 2015 But I Do Think The Dead Ringer IS Kinda Cheap And I Hate It When I Get Killed By A Spy Who i Though I Killed. All In All A Master Piece
I recommend this game to every one who has a steam account because you will see the funniest things on this game than any thing I ever saw!
"Due to the new update i don't recommend tf2 finding matches takes forever, i can never find a match in tf2. its either my computer crashes or i have to wait at least 30 minutes. I miss the old tf2 with autobalance and non laggy servers. This is why I do not recommend tf2."
It's A Great Game
Its awsome
might consume life
  10/10
"Team Fortress 2 Is an amazing FPS game that is loved by many. Updates are frequent and the weapons are abundant. The servers are based in many different states (and countries) for the player's convenience. The gameplay and art style is amusing and I enjoy it. If you have the time and economic skils, you can even profit from the game!   I have been playing this game for a few years now, and I joined when the community was at its peak. Community servers were abundant and common and the Pinion Pot of Gold was as annoying as ever. Back then, being as bad as I was, it's obvious that I got stomped on, making me wish the community away. Now, three years later, TF2 is losing popularity and the community is slowly losing its sanity along with its integrity. The most common occurence is a pub tryhard who will stomp the living crap out of a player and then continue to insult them just because you have killed them. The people they do this too could be the very people that would someday become a part of our community. The amount of community servers is slowly decreasing, and the players who play are either completely clueless or some insane salty tryhard who obviously plays to help balance his emotions. I wish I could help support the new people more. If you're new, add me and I will try to help you learn how to play.  I do agree with a lot of the negative reviews and I see why you would and should avoid this game. If you cannot take the emotional stress of dealing with constant online insults, you can either not play the game, turn off the chat (which tends to be no fun because the people insulting others get increasingly mad to a breaking point which is funny to watch) or ignore the insults, which is what I do. Now, there are a lot of good people still, but they're much less common than your average tryhard. If you're ready to rumble, then download this game and try it for yourself?"
"simply they stuffed team fortress 2 over they got rid of dedicated severs in which if you live anyway but U-S-A like me (Australia) your going to have laggy matches because there are bascially no severs in Au, your going to have to deal with competitive being forced down your throat even in casual BLOODY CASUAL IS NOW COMPETITIVE.  all i want back is dedicated severs and the old search system back as well."
WTF? Used To Be 19.99$ USD. Whatever Anyways Very Great Game Unfortunatley The Models For any class are errors Probaly Is My GMOD Anways 100% Reccomend For People Who Like to go through an Awesome Life In 1 Awesome Game  Valve If You Make Team Fortress 3 Make it like this Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ;( ;( ;(!!!!!!!!!!!!111111!!1!1!1111 !!!!!!!!!!111 Really Am Looking Forward To See TF3 In 2015.
"Has an extremely nice cartoony style,with great teamwork and clever humor with zany items to boot.Its ♥♥♥♥ing genious!"
The Best Game on PC. Ever-expanding. It's too good.
"How to feel good playing this game: Heal people on fire about to die with 1 health left. Bonk a heavy about to decimate your team. Snipe that spy about to chain stab your team. Build teleporter exit to first spawn point near the end of a match. Backstab a sniper until he switches to razorback. Headshot him until he switches to pyro. Win a match after team sh*ttalker moves to other 'winning' team. Kick a bad medic for trying. Getting 50 kills in a row also feels pretty good, if you can do it. Don't acknowledge the people who defecate in their living room instead of their bathroom. People who bring all their life problems to the game, known as ragers, don't realize the fundamental aspect of entertainment. Whatever good or bad thing happens while playing, is ultimately for your entertainment. You will forget this playing TF2 though just saying and become a rager yourself."
Heavy is credit to conga line
"Awesome game considering it's free to get started. I'd even pay to own it, but considering I've spent plenty on purchasing weapons and cosmetics for my son and I, you can say I did pay for it. Buying and trading items to use in the game can be addictive, time consuming, and expensive. Beware. But overall, a great game."
A very fun and addicting game!
"From shooting people to conga-lining. Fighting Players and fighting robots. Team Fortress 2 has a mass ton of fun for anyone who likes Dressing-up, Shooting, Fighting, Halloweening, and having fun. But beware of crates, they're everywhere."
IT..... CHANGED...... MY LIFE......... ALSO DEMO-KNIGHTS ARE CANCER
yes i like the game it is cool have you are mario yes? ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ you are gay ayy lmao
i hust did this for the badge
The game in it self is an amazing experience to say the least and its so good i forgot what i was gonna say
It's an amazing game I love it!!!
One of the best games i've ever played!Already spend 80$ on it.
I recomend this game to anyone who wants to play a good fps with a good community. I have a decent amount of hours in the game and i admit that every time i hop on theres something fun to do from arena to payload to zombie fortress there is something out there for everyone. The only problem i got with this game is that hats are what rule your life a good hat means you got skill aparently
Amazing game! They're always adding in new items.
Best ♥♥♥♥ing game ever install worth the 7 gbs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Really like this game.It looks like a cartoon.It`s really cool and i like the classes.My favourite class is the Scout and sometimes the Heavy.I like the Scout becouse he`s fast and has the best gun.Who ever is new to Steam i recomend Team Fortress 2 becouse it`s really fun!!
"I played in this game from 2008, right from the first time when i read review on this game in a cozy 'Igromaniac'... Author said the game has a lot of advantages, 9 distinct glasses, and the main thing... cozy, expensive and cool customization... Later (about a week later) we played on some custom map with my friends and were thinking how this game was cool, how it is well balanced and stuff... But later, we noticed one more thing:the game was always changing. The gameplay was changing, there was added new custom parts... and you know what? i left from this game, because i didn't like all this changes...  In 2012 (or 2011) my friend sucked me back in the game with the arguement of 'dude, you have to check it out'. And the thing was men vs. machine update. I was more than amazed... so much changed for all this 4 years while in most other games stuff stays the same!   I highly recommend this game to everybody: from the ones who likes bloody shooters, to the people who likes fat eastern eggs on stuff from media. And especially changes, because this game lives more than 8 years now, and it keeps changing, it keeps being popular, it keeps being fresh."
this game is good...too fun to play with friends...and on lan...
"I like taking photos of almost everything on TF2. When I cleaned up my disk, I freed up 2 GB.  What am I doing with my life."
"I've had COUNTLESS hours of CONSTANT fun with this game! I grew up playing this and I've made almost half of my Steam friends through it! I just absolutely LOVE the concept and idea of this game! I'm always getting into duels and battles to see who's better among my friends (We play arena to see who lasts the longest, last person standing) and I usually get into the mediocre sort of range... I'm nothing special at the game, but I see myself as a pretty good Scout, an OK Medic, a good Heavy, and a great Sniper. I find all sorts of different ways to traverse all sorts of maps as Scout and test my sharpshooting on 2Fort as Sniper. I've played with lots of nice people and on servers with 'Plug-ins' that allow you to get upgrades and buffs kind of like an overpowered version of Mann vs Machine in which You and your team of 5 others fight for a certain amount of rounds against Robots and they keep getting harder and harder. Just wait until the tank comes! Then you have a full-team target! Great game overall and you should DEFINITELY get this game!"
This game used to have toast. I like this.
"Brutal game with hats thats has hat, did I said Hats twice?"
"A game of which I loved quite heavily in the past, though I have not owned it for a long time. Sadly, it has become more of an enjoyable pass time than the adored game it once was. I still enjoy it, but the barrage of new 'Weapons skins' and constant almost identical updates have made the game, different in my eyes, more that it has become a pass time because nothing really seems to change anymore. Still an interesting game though."
Very Fun Multiplayer Game with 9 Playable Classes. Play with friends with several different Gamemodes. I certainly enjoy playing this all the time and reccommend VSH Saxton Hale
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=UbaGodU_Gkw   This video says it all. (Video belongs to rightful owner)
Probably the best game i have ever played on pc
"Team-Fortress 2...Well,tf2 is a really nice and popular game which will blow your mind.You have 9 different choices of weird characters,from the fast scout to the giant heavy weapons guy.Since it's free,you can have one of the best fps you can play for free!TF2 is also a game that will let you make your own server in which you will be capable to do anything you want.I highly recommend tf2 to those who:Want to play a game which will make them laugh and will have enjoyable combat at the same time.Also if you are good a programming and you want a game which will allow your ideas to leave your mind and join the internet,here it is!"
i only played for a bit but i think this game is pretty nifty
"THis is one of my favorite games that I always seem to play even when I try to stop playing, Plus I get to do more than just kill, and the cosmetic's are Great in all fun. but alot of cosmetics are holiday resticted. and I always seem to get a game in tf2 cuz their is always alot of people on tf2. plus it is completely balanced unlike CoD, but every majior update can possibly unbalance the game and so they get working on fixing this unbalance, also is unlike any other game I played so far."
i love this game becaouse its fun to play and therer are a lot of good death run maps 
"I really like everything in TF2, (hats, weps, random drops, etc). My three favorite classes, are, Pyro, Demo, and, medic. Run in with Pyro and try to fry as many as possiable, hope that theres no medics so that your run wouldn't be ruined, Demo, I had one awesome round with Demo, my team was really close to getting the last cap point, and then i used the 'Charge N Targe', and ran on the point and won for us, and i noticed when, i turned around, everyone was coming in. Medic, first class i ever played in TF2, i like how Medic is a simple class, just go heal, maybe heal yourself a bit, but not too much, because you want your teammates to live for a bit longer, and, thats all you gotta do, nothing more..."
Hats. Conga. Dismemberment. All a man needs in life
♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥. I HATE THIS GAME. I HATE IT SO MUCH I PLAY IT ALL DAY OUT OF SPITE!!!
really fun game if u like first person shooters and team vs team
"This game is amazing as it is simple, 9 classes The Scout,Soldier,Pyro,Medic,Spy,Sniper,Heavy(weapons guy),Demoman And the Engineer battle it out representing their 2 teams, Red/Blu. with a plethera of Maps, Weapons, Gamemodes and hats YEAH HATS!!!! this game is a great pick up for the casual player and the serious gamer. GO MEDIC FOR ONCE"
This is good game
TF2 is my favorite game i think i should give it a 10.0 star rating i love this
In the negative section: - People who exclusively play 24/7 2FORT ALL-CRIT PONY that think they know enough about the game to judge it. - People who are mad that their favourite crutch was rightfully balanced - People not even judging the game based on the game - ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s
It's not that bad.
"yeeesh, this game is weird! @_@"
"Mic spamming, gibberish speaking, 8 to 12 year old kid simulator. Thanks to our one and only, savior and almighty Gaben for implementing 'cl_voice_enable 0' console command. Taking care of us from brain damage since June 23, 2011.  Other than that, I'd say the game is gud."
This Is a Good Game 
"  A nice,fair fps game"
Its a Nice game I hope that you do like it!
Great Game
I love this game :D
"If you ever want to masturbate while being entertained at the same time, I recommend trying this."
Can't go wrong everybody likes this game.
"This game is the best online shooter i have seen in a long while. This game has a very fun multiplayer experience,the best maps and most of all it has an amazing community. This game is what you will expect from a shooting game and so much more, This game has different classes that balance each other out, that and it also has weapons that are balanced, which makes it a lot more fun when you get new weapons. This game has the best community made maps and good ways to talk to new people, The best part about this game is,IT'S FREE, yes the whole game is free and you should try it out for yourself to know what the heck im talking about. So to summarize this whole thing i can only say that play this game and you might have the best time of your life, Thanks Valve for making awesome games like this."
a wonderfull piece from valves source engine all hail gaben gaben is hat gaben is key
favorite game on steam right now 
"Good FPS game, probably best Free game I have ever seen."
I've never been so obsessed with virtual cosmetics before
Really awesome game &lt;3 everyone should atleast try this game.
A highly addicting waste of time. I like it!
i love this game 
A great time! Gameplay is extremely varied and can almost never get boring. Please don't buy hats.
The best free first-person shooter out there.PLAY IT NOW!
"Great Game, I had lots of fun playing this because of Dodge Ball and other minigames some servers have."
"A must have Free-to-Play game that is well balanced in all classes and a bunch of the weapons. If you haven't played it already, you're missing out on a lot of fun."
Team Fortress 2 is a good game its a FPS you can get hats' misc and you can buy from the MANN.CO store 'note you can buy the hats and misc from the MANN.CO store' 
"Join Hat Simulator Fortress 2 now! This game is filled with awesome mercenaries that will be better if you make them wear hats! Because hats are their life. 10/10. Seriously though, get this game. It is not your regular FPS game. This game has enough charm to make your head explode. You will have hours of fun and hats. So stop reading and download this game for FREE.  (And later on, buy hats on the store.)"
"A thriving community and countless memes have spawned from possible one of the biggest games of all time. Sadly, no game lives forever. TF2 did not. I'm not going to tell you to not play it. It's free, and it's FUN. Not what it used to be, tho. Back in the good old days of TF2, we had people actually playing the game like a fun first person shooter. But the game has slowly turned towards a trade-based, game with barely any traces left of the past golden age of TF2. Play it if you want, I'm not stopping you. And if you're new,   where the hell have you been for the past 3 years?!"
I likeD this Game although its animation but its very interesting and u dont have to pay to be pro ! .... just play and enjoy
1 year ive been playing this and i still think im new to this game
I recomend this game
This game is actually good and alot of people seem to hate the game due to the whole 'FREE TO PLAY' update and alot of people actually think this is a problem but this actually gives steam more profit from Team fortress 2 and it was one of the most played games on steam and they made it free to play because it was really good and alot of people make really good things for this game and you should actually play this game.
Best game to ♥♥♥♥ around in. 11/10
it is a good game
Those who do not get this game are wimpy spies.
I like this game
"This game... This game... I have dedicated over 200 hours of playing time to this game, leaving every other game in my library collect dust (with the exception of fallout new vegas), however; I feel like I could easily put in another 1000 hours without getting bored. This game is, by no means, a free to play, play to win, but it is very tempting to spend hundreds of dollars on cosmetics, stranges, killstreaks, and (of course) hats. Most of the things that truly make the game more exciting, such as new strategic weapons, are obtained through time and determinations, not money. There is a very strong continuum of skill throughout the game, making some servers too difficult or too easy, depending on chance. The latest update, while rebuked by some, is actually quite interesting. The new weapons aren't too underwhelming and the gifts are pretty excitng, like a raffle of sorts. Overall, it is one of my favorite games and one I hope will stay around for another six years.  Update: 9.5/10 still no Star Wars hats.  Update: 500 hours later and still in love. I'm already feeling nostalgia for how I used to play the game.  Update: 10/10 There's a lightsaber. A f♥♥♥ing Lightsaber."
"If you wanna do nothing but conga, this is the game for you."
I love touching tips with my bros
"Team Fortress 2. Arguably the most popular FPS on the PC. This game is insanely fun, even after so many years of playing. Every class is still working as they should. (well, except the Demoman, but let's face it, Valve made every single one of his unlocks make you play him differently) The addition of the steam workshop compatibility makes all new possibilities come up. So, even 5 years after its initial release, Team Fortress 2 is a MUST HAVE FUN GAME, and since it's free now, there's no excuse."
idk why i waste my life on this piece of crap
Awesome! :sentry:
I recommend this game
"Amazing game for casual play and tycoon-like economic building of your items, I reccomend 9.5/10"
"The game itself is highly addictive, very fun to play. But I have noticed this game has a lot more problems than most games. Kids screaming into mics, scamming on trading, aimbots (hackers), spawncamping (VERY much a problem), etc. Other than the multitude of flaws, it is a good game, but given the flaws, I find myself wanting less and less to play it"
"fun with friends, fun alone, great for anyone"
"Once you get used to the game, you'll be playin it every single day just like me"
free epic nufff said
"Presentation - 8.5/10 User interface shows you all you need to know, solid feature set all around, and great little touches of polish.  Graphics - 9.5/10 The art style is such a forceful presence in this game, adding to the enjoyment you get out of it and the allure to keep playing. A strikingly coherent artistic vision.  Sound - 9/10 Many of Valve's staple sound effects are mixed in with excellent weapon and voice effects to yield excellent results.  Gameplay - 9/10 It's difficult to describe, but this game just feels right. From the way the weapons handle to the way your character scampers around the environments. An absolute blast to play.  Lasting Appeal - 8.5/10 Very Lasting... very lasting indeed  OVERALL - 8.9/10"
"The second best first person shooter, Overwatch being the best. Runs on almost any computer, and its free (and not full of pay2win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t). There is no reason not to get this game."
"Ah, the noble, bittersweet taste of autism."
its such an amaizing game...
"i love this game, rate is you think the same!"
Only played a little. It was okay
  Some might call it too much fun 
"One of the best and most unique FPS games I've ever played. Play this and every other Valve game here, believe me it is worth the cash."
watch your back and have no mecry cause its backstabing time.
"this is the BEST free to play first person shooter, I HIGHLY reccomend this game"
"I can describe this game in 5 words: HATS, CRITS, FUN, GREAT TIME"
hey everyone go check out TF2 one of the best games out there and now free to play!
"Team Fortress 2 is the 2nd installment of the Team Fortress series (TF, TFC and TF2). It features 9 different classes, that have different habilities and weapons. Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Heavy, Demoman, Medic, Sniper, Engineer and Spy, this are the classes to choose.  The game is known for its huge amount of hats, which can be buyed from Mann Co. Store or be earned by drops or achievements.  It has constant updates, great amount of hats and weaponry, and also its alternate gamemode, Mann Vs Machine, where you'll need to fight waves and waves and waves of robots were ONE of 'em holds the Bomb. Don't let them get to the hatch!  You will enjoy this game! And also is F2P, so don't make any excuses and play it! You will not regret it!"
Nice game !
11/10 with conga
"An accurate representation of the US economy, and how inflation functions in a virtual space. In the case of Team Fortress 2, Keys are the virtual currency, and seeing how they went from 8 Refined Metals in 2013 to around 20 as of the time of this review... really puts into perspective how inflation can make a once inviting market become elevated to an inconcievable level.   Why does this matter? Well, the point of Team Fortress 2 is to collect as many meaningless cosmetic items as possible. This was once a possible objective for any aspiring entrepeneur, but now, it's nearly impossible. Unless you buy into the market, you are basically unable to progress in any meaningful fashion.     In conclusion, for those who don't wish to scroll through my ramblings; you can't get any really interesting items, like taunts or hats, unless you buy into the market. And for a game that is, in general a war-time hat simulator that is also FREE-TO-PLAY... being unable to effectively aquire cosmetics without investing large sums of money.   What is the problem with this? I'll tell you.          I'm not really sure."
"Possibly one of the greatest first person shooters developed, due to its unique style, character diversity and likeable personality. Though slightly hampered by the occasional chat spammer, multiplayer is relatively enjoyable overall.   Would definitely recommend this game to people new to the genre - learning curve is quite shallow and the ingame tutorials as well as the community guides do much to aid new players. Those coming from a different FPS, particularly more formal and 'FPSish' games like Battlefield or CoD may find it a bit hard to adjust to the different playstyles, but everyone adapts eventually.   "
"It's TOO hard to resist the hats. It's a nice ♥♥♥♥ing game for a f2p, though... anyways, I got VAC ban lol"
"Great and a fun-full game! I really like Valve games, so this is one of the Valve games that is endless to play."
This game is the reason why I have Steam account in the first place.
"A great multiplayer game that one would think should have died a while ago and been forgotten. But it's still going strong.  Despite their being no actual goals (such as getting stronger or aquiring ranks to display), the game still manages to be good fun. Part of this is due to the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously with the visual style and the way characters will spout humerous lines and specific points during a game.  Many people call it a 'Hat simulator', but this is only true depending on what server you play on. Choose the right server(s) and I guarantee you will have fun and the collectable hats will not get in the way and only serve to keep players looking like individuals rather than cut and paste clones.  and it's free to play. There's no reason not to give it a try.  "
runied my life/10
"I am so tired of seeing free to play games where you can't be as good as anyone else without spending your money TF2 offers the perfect solution to this: everything can be obtained in-game by random drops or trading with players, however, you can get items much faster by paying money, but it is in no way required on top of that, I love the way that all the classes are overpowered in some unique way, counter ballencing the other, overpowered classes, it is a very unique model for a game"
"  It's better than Call of Duty, hands down."
"There are only two reasons to why you could possibly hate this game. 1: You are a steryotipical 10 year old Call Of Duty ♥♥♥♥♥♥, who hates every FPS other than COD 2: You only have 2 working brain cells All in all 11/10 Would play again."
"This game is awesome. I'm sure you will love this game. Best thing is that the game is free2play. For me personally would be better if game had some leveling system, so you could progress and get some bonuses. Anyway if you didn't played this game, do it now! 10/10"
must! play!TEAM FORTRESS TWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! &gt;:D
"Awesome game,concept,but too many hats and f2p"
"It is very addicting, if you haven't played it, play it now! It is worth it!"
This is an amazing first-person shooter. Very fun. I wish keys could be found via the drop system though.
this game is magnificent. Brilliant gameplay all aroudn equal and has a nice economy style feel to it. all in all a great game
very fun and a relativly easy game to play 
This is amazingness. Get it. OR ELSE.
10/10 most fun and addicting game ever
"It's free, it's fun as hell, and new stuff is often happening, if you do not own this game, you NEED to own this game"
"TF2 is a balanced, fun game that has given me allot of joy over the past year, its class based game-play and fun, fast-paced combat never ceases to entertain me, and with the seemingly never-ending stream of content Valve is continuing to produce, along with the already phenomenally designed maps, it doesn't show any sign of getting stale any time soon."
"Theirs no reason you shouldnt get this game, ive played for over 500 hours and still having fun, and it's free! i really roceomend it to everyone."
its amazing i love the graphics And EVERYTHING!!!!!! I wish Valve would make Team fortress 3 :(
this game is amazing if you want a multieplayer shooter games with tons of weapons and hats you can never forget the hats
this most fun and awesome fps game I ever seen and also it is free!!!
"TF2 is the only first person shooter that I can play. It has a few balance quirks as of right now, but aside from that, an incredibly fun game, from the perspective of someone who's always hated first person shooters with a fury."
"Spectacular gameplay, spectacular community, spectacular map design... Why wouldn't you play this? Hell, it's even free."
"Awesome Game!  Trading Is Awesome!  Gameplay Is Awesome!  Community Is Not So Awesome D: (12 year olds all day)  Items Are Awesome  10/10, Would Hoard Hats Again."
tf2 is the best game ever 
Went from shooting mercenaries to finding bread  10/10 would play again
"As a Cod, I was really blown out of the water by how much I enjoy this game. No class feels overpowered or useless, which really adds variety to the gameplay. Even more variety can be found in the different weapons you can unlock for each class. The addition of hats and cosmetic items really has given the game a sense of fun and chaos you don't find in the more generic FPS games.  (Any game where I can hit someone to death with a fish is a plus in my book.)"
"Great game, hours of enjoyment."
Nice game
"Welcome to Hat Simulator 2 The best Free 2 Play game ever created.  This game is so well done and keeps getting updates from ValvE which is awesome, almost every week a new update with new content. If you haven't tried it yet, well then you are pretty late because this game is 7 years old by now.. but you are never too old to download this game because it's the best free 2 play game ever created and it will be for ever  All hail lord gaben to release Hat Simulator 3"
"Best Funny and Free To Play Game To Spend Time!! :) Really Nice Graphics!! Love The Part Of Exist More Than 1 Class Great Multiplayer Modes , It Has Competitive Too Heavy Is So Funny With His Sasha aha :D My Favorite Class Is Sniper Great Community Too!! Congrats!! :)"
"I....to be perfectly honest, I really don't know how to start off this review, so I'll just jump right in saying this 'update' is quite possibly the WORST update I've ever witnessed within a game.   So after a few months of 'quitting' TF2, I decided to hop in a game right before I had to go to work bright and early in the morning. Needless to say, I was awoken with an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥torm. Was I able to just pop right into a game without any trouble? Think again...  Quickplay has been replaced by 'Casual' - you can no longer choose your map or freely join a match. Not to mention, the matchmaking takes a tremendous amount of time; I honestly wasn't able to find a match for over 20 minutes. What is this now? PAYDAY 2: CE for the Xbox One?  the very first time I encountered this new type of ..uhh 'matchmaking' I was honestly devastated. WHAT happened to just being able to join a match without ease and pop in/out of a game with ease? Now if you leave mid-game, you get punished (I don't know for how long, but when I saw that I really felt like this was the end). Mind you the games generally last a long time, and I'm fairly certain not everyone has time to play the -entire- match.   at least for me, I've NEVER taken this game seriously - I mean, I've taken the matches seriously, but in the end, who actually gave a ♥♥♥♥ if the team lost or won? The game was made for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles, and to just have a blast.   I never thought Valve would ever soil such a fun, amazing, simple yet incredibly satisfying game like good ole' (literally) Team Fortress 2. One of the fewest games I would stay up until 8 am the next morning and play all night, being able to jump in/out of games fast and easy. Now the game is pretty much butchered and unless they can somehow manage to fix this henious mess, I can honestly foresee the end for this game."
"I would definetly reccomend this game it is amazing.No lag,fiar classes and weapons,and great gameplay.Also,the classes have wonderful personalitys,(sorry for mispells)the maps,gamemodes and graphic style are all AMAZING!And dont get me started on the Steam comunity on this game,they are awesome.Now,this is going on for a while,so i say i give this a 8.9,great for people who have grown out of COD or hates it(like me)and wants a laugh while killing people.SO GO PLAY IT!NOW!im still here,wiating.C'mon,play it,ill end the guide here,PLAY IT!"
"TF2 is a must have and you should feel ashamed and dirty if you don't already have it. Everyone and their mother is boasting their F2P game nowadays, but it usually turns out to be a Pay2Win. TF2 is not like that at all. While some people may argue the whole Mann Co. Store makes the game Pay2Win, they're lying. Every weapon in the game can be aquired through random drops. No painful leveling, no grinding. Just play at your own leisure and the weapon will eventually fall into your lap. If you are an impatient little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you can always just go to the Mann Co. Store and spend a candy bar's worth of money on whatever weapon you want. TF2 is an incredibly balanced game with no class being better than the other *COUGH* Pyro*COUGH* All of that aside you have 9 completely different play styles if you don't count the plethora of different weapons and gamemodes where you might play a class entirely different. Valve, the sweethearts they are, also host holiday events and constantly add in new weapons and hats. Oh yeah, there are hats. Along with competitive play you can spend money to play with friends COOL RIGHT?! In all honesty, the TF2 Co-Op gamemode is lots of fun and is really hectic and chaotic, but DEAR GOD IS IT DIFFICULT. It's probably just cause I suck. TF2 is truly a spectacle in the FPS world, managing to rake in more money than Ethiopia in a year by selling hats. Now, these hats are not real. They are a line of code. They don't increase health or make you jump higher. They make you look cool. This is one of the aspects I'm not so crazy about. This hat-hierarchy if you will, causes a lot of discrimination between the community as to who's free to play and who's not. Along with that, the community is not the best in the world, especially not the Man Vs Machine one, TF2's Co-Op game.    Overall TF2 is a great game to have in your library. It brings hours and hours of fun and excitement and is great to play with friends or by yourself. As an FPS in general it is more goofy than Battlefield or Call of Duty. What it lacks in seriousness it makes up for in charm and being better than Call of Duty. My final rating for TF2 is 8/10 for being a fun and totally replayable FPS for everyone. It is great as an entry level FPS or one for veterans. ALSO IT'S FREEEEEEE! So go on, go get it. What are you waiting for? I'm going to stand here until you go and get it.   If you disagree with me feel free to tell me why and try and sway my opinion otherwise."
if this game was a potato it would be a good one.
Very exciting and thrilling game. Makes you surprised all the time! Recommended for EVERYONE!
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) m8 play this game
TF2 is an awesome way to spend a short amount of time relaxing. Jump in / Jump out and have fun
This game ruined my life
"This game is amazing. Be sure to play it sometime, and all glory to the ham. 11/10"
"From my personal experience, this was an okay game until July of 2014. There are some things to avoid doing, try to follow this adticle to be a better player:  •Don't be an a**hole on public servers a.k.a. Pub-stomping.  •Don't be a rude admin who requires free items from random players on trade servers.  •Don't be rude to new/younger players, everyone starts out somewhere.   •Don't be the pyro that doesn't extinguish team-mates. You'll see why if you're new reading this.  •Last but not leas: Don't spend too much money on the game. Pay-to-Play is what can literally ruin your REAL WORLD wallet.  Other than these few of my wishes, have fun with the game!"
"What can I say about tf2, that already hasn't been said? Well at its core tf2 is just like every other shooter. (you click on people) But it's still different enough in order for lots people to play it instead of other FPS. This is also my second favorite game and I definitely recommend it!"
"Team Fortress 2 is one of my favorite online games of all time! With the overflow of CoD's and CoD rip-offs, it's great to have a refreshing, different take on the first-person-shooter genre. I mean, what other online fps has virtual hats? P.S.~ God, I'm good at being an owl!"
Hours of fun
Its a cool fps game its simple and its easily like the heavy is for the guys who cant aim that good and the medigun is easy This has required alot of work i think you should give this a chance to get bigger and bigger
i never want to stop playing
Killed a man with a Lolli-Pop 10/10 would pay for.
I RATE IT 5 STARS
For being played Free It's such an amazing game Play it now for fun!!! -Haiku
10/10 would bang... legit just so SEX-AY
Best game ever! 699 Hours played.
I've been playing the game for 3 years and I luffff it
10/10 would pay for hats again.
"Good game, I really enjoy this. Compared to some people i have a very small amount of time spent but i every minute of that time was well spent, Other then the loading screens :)"
"In short, this game gives hours of fun. It's free to play, but is strongly recommended that you upgrade to premium (you can use your steam wallet to pay for the cheapest thing in the store, if you wish to upgrade).  9 Unique classes and multiple weapons per class, you'll enjoy this game for a long time.   There are also lots of different mods, gamemodes and maps."
"I didn't remember clearly, what were my first thoughts when I started to play this game. But now-2 years and nearly 1000 hours later- this is the best game I have ever played. Why?  Because it's fun. Everybody can find his/her main character from the nine and play with the others as a TEAM.  Oh, and you can earn money with it."
"One of the best all around games ever made.  Endless fun, this game should need no introductions!"
ERRMERRRGRRRR SO ARSOOOOOOOOOOMM 
This is a great multiplayer game that I would recomend getting. I do believe it should rated E and not M and it is a nice game for children.
this game is a fun and free game for mac pc and linux
Have fun eatting sandviches while watching your friends murder each other ya turkey.
"Sat on top of my sentry gun and loudly drank beer while everyone died around me, then did the conga to the nearest hat shop and spent all my money.  420/10 Its not a game its a way of life"
iz the best f2p game out there in my opinion. You start small and climb up the hill o hats. Soon you be up there with the big hat league. gl
great game
"Great multiplayer game, especially Mann vs. Machine. You'll spend hours playing it. It's free to play so you have no excuse not to try it."
"I love this game, because of the fact that it has, over the past 5 or so years, developed a diverse and mechanical economy of its own. I have spent countless hours trading, crafting, and buying several hundreds of items over the past year. And the fact that this economy has been almost entirely developed by the Steam Community is remarkable. I would be shocked if I found a steam user who did not already own this masterpiece of a game. Any other MMOFPS game that has been thrown my way has not even come close to the mastery of this here game. 10000/10. (TL;DR)"
"This game is a must for anyone starting on PC gaming. It's full of strategy, action, stupidity, extremely customisable, and has atttracted a community spreading across the world.  The characters are well-thought out, you'll find a range of gameplay styles and modes, and best of all it's free."
'I didn't need a life anyway' - Everyone
"Pros: - Nice to have fun  - Lots of different weps and hats  - You can play free  - Premium accounts can have very nice drops, like hats  Contras: - Free accounts just have 50 backpack slots   In spanish:  Pros: - Muy buen juego para pasar el rato  - Muchas armas y sombreros distintos  - Puedes jugar gratis  - Las cuentas de pago tienen mejores 'dropeos' como sombreros  Contras: - Las cuentas gratuitas solo tienen 50 espacion en la mochila"
Very fun game. Can be intense for un prepared players. Items are costly if you dont know your prices. Otherwise a very intertaining game.
There's hats.
get the game it to fun man
"IT IS AWESOME,I LOVE IT THANKS TO BEBLAZED HE INVITED ME!!! AFTER 5 HOURS I WAS COMPLETLY ADDICTED TO THE GAME BUT WHAT I DON`T LIKE IS,YOU DON`T GET BILLS HAT WHEN YOU PLAY LEFT FOR DEAD 2 #`_'"
Great trading platform with very balanced classes.
Great game!   10/10 would ♥♥♥♥!  
They Always Have More Time To make it Better :D
Spent more time on this game then i did with my family   10/10
"This game is fun and you should start out official server multiplayer. It is fairly easy to learn and i suggest playing as the pyro first, then moving on to the heavy. Also, there are lots of fun smaller servers and a great trading community along with a competitive community. Also, you can go on special non-official servers such as randomizer, where every quality about your character is randomized to anything on any class, including having 3 different-class weapons."
Best Game ever 10 out of 10. Super fun :D
10/10
I AM BRUCE LEE
"The game is awesome, can't complain"
"Good game great chatacters,great fun,great fun getting drops,great graphics for the age it was made,great company made this,GREAT NO SCOPES I DO 360 NO SCOPES m8 U ♥♥♥♥♥ COUNTS WHY U LOOK AT THIS REVIEW DOWNLOAD THIS GAME ITS F2P Btw: I cant now go outside to pee bcuz of this it ruined my life 100000/5 - IGN"
"This game is over 9000. this has to be one of the best valve games. The classes are so well balanced, there are always new weapons, and TAUNTS, HATS, AND MISC."
"This game is extremely fun to play, the friendly community will welcome most people of good nature, and the modded servers allow for many different experiences through this game."
"A stunningly vivid and undeniably fun team-oriented first-person shooter. The userbase consists of nothing but an incredibly varied mixture of veterans and beginners alike as you and your comrades work together to decimate the entire enemy team, choosing from nine classes, each with their own unique gameplay style.  --- oh, who am I kidding  That isn't TF2. TF2 is a conga line simulator with hats in it."
The best multiplayer fun I had since Medal of Honor 1 on Playstation and splitting TV screen with cardboard!
this is one of the greatest games I've ever played. Valve keeps adding more stuff and the best part is there is a whole economy for this game! :D also it does require good team work but it should be called Hat fortress 2.
super addicting and fun game with unique classes really takes away from main stream cod shooters on todays market of fps's
If you don't have this your stupid
Do I even have to say anything about this ♥♥♥♥ing amazing game
Endless opportunities of fun. 10/10
this game is like the best but if i have a bill's hat and a bud it will be better
Team Fortress 2 is an online multplayer shooter.  But over all I will say that Team Fortress is a great game and I recommend giving it a try its free to play so you should have no excuse not to have played it once.
"If you want to be screamed at by 12 yearr olds i recommend this game. Seriously though, great game, not serious at all and MVM is a lot of fun"
Best FPS out there. Great level of diversity. Timelessly entertaining.
:)
A+ hat-based dating simulator would spend another 100+ hours playing.
"Incredibly diverse game.   You can either play or trade, the game itself is incredibly easy to get into, no overpowered classes, everything is well balanced, easy to adjust to.   The trading part is less easy to get into, however once you are in, like the gameplay, its incredibly fun and diverse.   I have played this game for so long, and while I occasionally get bored, I am yet to find a game on par with TF2, gameplay, uniqueness and trading-wise.   "
Simply the best free to play game in the world!
"This Game is amazing, no spectactular, it is so evolved, so different than most fps that it can no longer be called a game, sure there are ♥♥♥♥♥ who play, sure there are little kids who don't know anything, and the few who do, but TF2 has so much to offer it is crazy, frequent updates, minigames, mods, ways to costomize your gameplay so much, it is great!!!!!!!"
Best F2P game ever that my crappy computer can run. Seriously though this game is awesome.
11/10  Gave me a bread related erection.

I blow hundreds of dollars on this game every year and I don't even really play it anymore.
can throw milk at a fat guy then whack him with a fish 10/10 oh and hats
"Great game, but needs more gamemodes."
"Good quality, a wide range of clothes and weapons to choose from, good trading system, and a lot of action! There is a wide range of people you'll meet in this game-both good to bad.  Some are good people who help you with the game. Some examples of bad people are hackers, phishers, scammers, etc."
"Really fun game. The more hats the funnier, and there is a lot of hats in this game."
"It was worth the $15 or $20 or whatever they were asking for before, but now it's free? Play it play it play it play it play it."
better then overbotch
"By far the most advanced hat simulator on the market today. Without games like this the internet would no doubt collapse. Not only does it contain a thriving hat economy, a fps also happens to function well as a bonus game."
Sniper: A Point And Click Adventure  Featuring hats!
WTF i win a match and i did not get exp that is bs!!!! 
"After joining a KotH_Lakeside server, I was greeted by ever-growing conga lines. Then, after a few minutes, the other team joined in. Then, at the last minute, everyone on our side died, and the entire opposing team of spies captured the point, and won singlehandedly.   Bread/10"
Still better than any call of duty. ♥
"I started to play this game at September 2011 an will try to make a short review.  Classes:  They are 9 classes to choose and every class has differents skills. Example there is a heavy with 300 life, slow but strong, he carrys a minigun, shotgun and his fists. The opposit would be the scout, he is very fast but only has 125 life and carry only a shotgun, pistol and a bat. They are also a Soldier, Pyro Demoman, Engineer, Sniper, Medic and Spy.  Wepons/Cosmetic All wepons are balanced. No op classes exist like wepons. But they are more wepons then the standards, every wepon has itself cons and pros. There is a wepon called like pain train, you can capture objetiv faster BUT you lose resitence against bullets. You also dont have to buy them in the store, you can find wepons randomly. Every week you might find 8 - 12 items, You can find hats who change your look, wepons to change them and crates. You can open crates with a key, the key can bought in the shop or being traded by the Community. You can find strange wepons there, who counts your kills or Unusual hats who has different effects.  Gameplay: They are 2 Teams called BLU (Builders League United) and RED (Reliable Excation Demolition) who fights always against them. They exist tons of maps by the community and by valve. They are still updates to hold the game alive. You can join Valve server where are most new players or find a server by the Community where you mostly find very good players.  Mods: They are currently many mods from valve and from the community. Payload: You have to push the bomb to the Fin to win. Capture the point: They are 5 points you have to capture them all to win. King of the hill: The team who holds the point is going to win the game. Capture the flag: You have to capture the other 'intellegent' Attack/Defense: Its like Capture the Point but blue can only capture and red can only defense Hale: 1 Player is a very strong character and must kill all other players on the server to win (no respawns) Deathrun: 1 actived traps and the other players have to go to the end to win (no respawns) and more...  Comic: This game can give you alot feeling about it. If you are really interested in the game/history, you really should read the comics. They have humor and cost nothing. It also give you alot knowledge about the game. You may find tons of Easteregg in it. Vavle really put few things in it and you might guess the next update :-)  My Point Its free, the community is fine, they are tons of mods, still get updated, a real free to play,... You really have to try it atleast they game."
"^ The hours that I have played. This is ridiculous.  No game I have ever played had this many hours on it. EVER. This game has everything a FPS could ask for. Its got some humor in it with the funny descriptions and the wierd combinations you can get with cosmetics.   It has a very strong economy from Backpack.tf (where people can vote on item prices) and from trading. This game is very heavily community based. The best part about that is the community is kind and lively. People are constantly submitting new items into the Steam Workshop in hoping that it may be put into the game.   This game you can trade, suggest, have fun, and play. All of this, for free. Just consider this before you go to the store and decide to buy that $40 FPS. Can you trade? Can you take part in a large community? Can you have fun even if you are losing the match?  Just think about what Team Fortress 2 has to offer. All of this. For free. "
"I love this game. I really do. I have spent so much $$$ on this game and now because of all my dedication to this game valve has decided to ♥♥♥♥ me. This new update is horrible. I used to have a custom hud but now it seems like you can't have one or else it breaks the game (I literally can't navigate to the find a game). They have also decided to tell anyone who doesn't want to fork over ten dollars to play a free game to go screw themselves as I am still waiting to join a valve server on casual (even though there are allready 600+ compatible servers near me). I would write a review about how the update has changed the game but like I said, I am still waiting to join one...  Edit: I have finally joined a game!!! And it sucks. They (valve) has changed a few of the skins for a few weapons that i like and the new 'skins' literally almost make me feel sick. the reloading on some has you hand just clip all the way through the weapon. Also the maps and the way they changed the hud is painful. If there is a petition to change it all back please tell me whereas this update has made me lose faith in valve.  As the saying goes. 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it'"
"this game should cost 12.000 pounds of money, to play, for 12 seconds! if you know what i mean :D"
It is simply awesome.You MUST play it!
This game is very good for FPS sheep. Best class is Spy  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXVBPgl9xWA 
Used A minigun that created a ring of fire and i flamed everyone around me get the most points on my team  10/10 Would Flame Scouts Around Me again
"This is my thoughts on Team Fortress 2.  Note that, I allready made a review of this game. But that was back when I didn't really have that much experiance with this game. So, now that I have more hours than usual piled into this game. I may as well give some really honest thoughts and some basic guidelines for people who want to get this game.  First off, it's entirely different to games like, battlefeild, Call of Duty and other general FPS games. So If your coming from one of those games, (Most likely from COD) your going to have to adjust to the new enviroment of Tf2. I know... that sounds hard, but seriously all you need to do is at least try.  But honestly, if you can get past the differances between all of those games and TF2 you'll find a great game. It's teamwork baised gameplay, the personality to it all...  OH! I should have mentioned that. The classes of Tf2 aren't your ordinary Soldiers and hired guns ooooooh no. Valve made it so that these guys WILL be embeded in your mind to the point that you don't want to forget them. From the Insane personality of the Medic, or cocky and immiture nature of the Scout and of course, the ever so famous Heavy, with his absalotely HALARIOUS dialouge.  Also, something else that makes TF2 Special, is the different weapons. You see the Weapons aren't so much upgrades, more like they are side grades and can change the play style of the current class your playing as.   The only things I can really complain about are pretty much personal stuff. However there IS also one major gripe I have with the game. And that is with one of it's core concepts, THE RANDOM CRIT SYSTEM. The reason I dont like this system is because, I could be kicking ♥♥♥ and then all the sudden a Soldier comes along and shoots a crit rocket and wipes me out in one shot.  But other than that small gripe. I really can't find anything wrong with this game. (Other than some of the members of the community. But hey, thats pretty much personal stuff.  As for the rating I give it, a 4.5 / 5 It's a Great game with a few design flaws. I would reccomend it to ANY die-hard FPS fan out there. Even if you are coming from a different game."
Great game for masochists.
Pretty good...
TF2 IS A FORCE FOR GOOD TF2 can increes the happiness of infected people. Happy people will want to infect others and they are less likly to work on a cure
This game is just ... awesome!
"It's like Call of Duty, but not bad."
"I love this game, its one of the best games I have ever played. It had alot of thought and effort put in to making it!"
"Great fun. Those 2 words describe this epic game. I have played 913.2 hrs on this account and 1560.2 hrs on my other account and I still havent got tired. Amazing game, Good fun, Fun community. Do not worry about hats and miscs they will drop in the server you playing on and you might just get one. Also collecting weapons and turning them into scrap will also be a way of you to get hats or miscs. 5 STAR GAME."
It is a 10 out of 10 game it is amazing and hilarious
Hat Tycoon 2 is the multi award winning hat trading simulator from Valve. You are Saxton Hale a successful hat salesman and professional Australian. One fateful day your best friend Bill has his hat stolen and held for ransom by evil hat terrorists. It is your job as the world's greatest hat salesman to raise the ransom and get Bill's hat back. The bulk of the game takes place in Trade Plaza where you attempt to sell your wares to various NPCs. Make sure to set the right price though as if you attempt to sell too high Saxton will be declared a Jew and the NPCs will be less likely to buy from you. Also watch out for the mysterious Demopan who occasionally shows up to steal your items. There is also a shooting minigame but you should only really play that to get new items to sell.
I LOVE THIS GAME! Guys if your a F2P or havent tried this game. BECOME A P2P AND ENJOY THE GAME! You Find EPIC Items. Wear EPIC hats Beat the Fricken Hell out of the opposite team. PLAY THIS GAME! ITS THE BEST!
Crafted two wooden bats and got metal 10/10
This game ruined my life  11/10
"Team Fortress 2 does an amazing job of creating very specialized classes for every type of player. Whether you're the type who likes to attack from afar, charge into battle, or even go undercover, TF2 has you covered. Since every character has exaggerated features based on their play style, I immediately understood each character from their look. For example, the Spy's slender and mysterious physique told me he wasn't the strongest, but he was probably stealthy. Since the name of the game is TEAM Fortress 2, the TEAM is a major part of it. To be successful, you need every class on the field. Sure there will be a few of a certain class, but a team full of snipers won't do any good if you don't have someone looking outside of a scope once in a while. One of the main problems a lot of people have with the game is Auto-Balance; spreading people around to fill empty spots on the other team. It annoys me a lot of the time, but it makes it fair. Sure you might've just scored 2 caps and someone else is about to make the third when you switch, but it is for the good. It's just a game, right? TF2 constantly makes me laugh, whether it's the Heavy's quote, 'POOTIS-PENSER HERE,' or the Medic's quote, 'OOPS, zat was not medicine!' If there is some sort of campaign, I haven't heard about it (at least for single player), but it makes up for it. Best of all, it's free, and you can conga while wearing a hat.  Pros: Fun for all player-styles Hilarious dialogue and art style Straightforward and easy to pick up Conga  Cons: Team Auto-balance sometimes No real storyline or single player campaign"
"Thanks to this game, I am officially a professional TF2 adult mercenaries shipper.  10/10 would write smut again."
its ok
10/10 Gives the opportunity for looking stylish with hats &amp; kicking ♥♥♥ at the same time. 
"10/10 Best Game Out On Steam At The Momement, Unbeaten since 2007 Great Work Valve"
I personally think the meet your match update is stupid. For starters valve introduced a stupid ranking system where you have to play a full game of tf2 to get your xp. They also replaced quickplay with casual and in casual you don't get to choose which map to play. Bring back the old TF2 Valve!!
"   (Yes, there is a Tl;dr at the end.)     This game is  REALLY  fun.  You may be noticing the other reviews, of people claiming the new update ruined the game. While this is somewhat close to being almost true, Valve is quickly fixing it, thanks to the community's feedback. As such, I wouldn't consider it a long-term factor when you're thinking about playing this or not.  Besides, just look at how many hours some people have on this game. Not 50, not 250, not 500, not even 999.........but THOUSANDS. Yes, plural. That shows just how much people love this game, before the update. Although, like I said, the negative affects of the update won't be around for long.  However, if you truly do have unbearably long wait times, just go online and find some non-official servers. My personal reccomendations are:   Skial , if you want something very similar to official servers  Harpoon Gaming , if you are just getting started with trading  Intox Gaming , if you want a good ol' time with custom maps and mods  Neonhight's Servers , if you want a fun experience with mods and maps, with a bit of trading mixed in  ACG  (Uber Upgrades, specifically), if you want to have way over-the-top OP battles.  Plus, there's the  amazing  community. We have popular YouTube channels, memes, and thousands (or, dare I say, millions) of players every day. In fact, we've got an entire fandom....sort of.     Tl;dr:     Play this game. If you don't like it in its current state, play Dirty Bomb or some other free substitute."
every one like this game
The best game ever.JUST THAT.
"Quite possibly the greatest hat simulator for P.C. as of right now, but the shooting elements feel tacked on and not as well polished as the hat simulating aspects of the game. Valve has also shown zero progress in fixing the game-breaking bug, where your steam funds slowly drain, and hats keep appearing in your inventory upon installing the game.  The shooting is sub-par, it is ladden with bugs, and the Community is terrible. But the Hats look cool. 11/10, would waste life on again."
"Metacritic, give this game a new review."
This is a fun game and is great for joining random servers where u can play just with your friends. Also has a wide variety of different game modes. Awesome
:^)
If you have a computer there is no reason why you shouldn't have played this game. (Unless it doesn't appeal to you.) So I guess there is a reason.
"Imagine this game as the Eldorado , Valve and the F2P introduction as a nuclear bomb and TF2 nowaday as the aftermath of that bomb .  That's how I see TF2 . It used to be great . On the way before the ruin , Valve added stuff . At first it was good . Then it started becoming suspicious . The hat phenomenon was at first a lol thing , that we first accepted ; that in-game market , that however , was no good .  And then there was the nuke . The Meet the Medic update , introducing the free to play . What was the reward to old players for buying the game ? A hat . It looks like a WW2 british hat , but for me , it evokes more like Valve's middle finger, pointed to my face . The community ... TF2 used to have one of the greatest and most friendly community I had ever seen in any FPS . Such perfection was anihilated in one day . Now , the autistic F2Ps who wouldn't even hit an AFK are everywhere . Is there a sentry blocking your way on your attack ? You'll have to destroy it yourself , because your allies will keep running on it and dying like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ turds they are . Managing to bring down some of the ennemies ? Too bad , five others will come on you alone . Some ennemy made it through your defense ? Then you're ♥♥♥♥ed . If you defend , you'll be there forever , as your team will never know how to capture an objective . If you attack , it's like an instant defeat , because your team doesn't defend . Nor attack .   The fact I'm referencing here is the team system . In every ♥♥♥♥ing server , it will be like this : one teams contains all the good players , one other contains the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ . If the team happen to be balanced , the goods will gather will the goods because it's TF2 and people won't like challenge . If you happen to be in the good team , the game will say ♥♥♥♥ you and 'team balance' : putting you alone in the team full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ , leaving you 1v10 .  Let's not forget the cancer of Demoknight , which make ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ unable to destroy sentries anymore , and the minisentry , the invention of satan himself .  That's only a few cons of the modern TF2 . The rest is up to yourself to see or to read by the other games review , as I assumed you've read a lot , but the most annoying thing is listed there .  It's not a game anymore . It's valve's personal milkstation , filled with the second most toxic community of videogames .  ♥♥♥♥ you valve , for you ♥♥♥♥ed us way too hard ."
despite the graphics this is still my faveourite steam game
Like skyrim with hats!

has lots of hats and crates 10/10 would play again
good game and free!
I highly recommend this game who are new to steam and its fun to play! Only problems that I have with this game is the amount of squeakers who ruin the fun by screaming and whining. Another is that people rage easily when killed or dominated. It can be fun at times but can get annoying later. Other than that. The game is good.
funniest and one of the best shooters out theres  hats are love hats are life
i love this game always making me happy when i am bored and helps me level up on steam with the amount of trading cards
"*Launches game* *Chooses fast, shooty-jumpy man* *Walks out of spawn* *Blown up* *Bird appears*   And here I am almost 2000 hours later  10/10 storyline better than Angry Birds gameplay better than Sonic '06 more hilarious than Slender more complex thanFlappy Bird more jumpy jumpy pew pew than Mega Man more competitive than Super Smash Flash better fanbase than FNAF better economy than trillions of dollars of debt  Would play for another 2000 hours"
I love this game and the items you can sell for actual money!
This game needs more hats.
"A friend introduced to this game back in November 2011 and I thank him for it! Team Fortress 2 is without a doubt one of the best, if not the best First Person Shooter available for the PC. The art style is really excellent, and makes it look very cartoony in a way which is incredible. In this game there are 9 classes, the first one being the scout, who's always the first out of the gate. The main advantage to the Scout is his speed, equipped with a Scattergun, Pistol and Bat makes him a fun class to play as you can flank enemies. The Soldier is another fun class, his main weapon he uses is a Rocket Launcher, with this he has the ability to rocket jump and able to get to spots most classes can't. The Pyro is quite an interesting class to say the least the flamethrower this class uses has the ability to reflect projectiles back at enemies, which makes this class the perfect counter to Soldier. The other classes are great to which are the Demoman, Engineer, Medic, Heavy, Sniper and Spy. Each class has something unique to them which makes it fun.   The gameplay is fantastic and never gets boring, this game was released all the way back in 2007 and it still has a very active community which shows how much people love this game. I give Team Fortress 2 a 9.5/10 to me this is the perfect first person shooter and it's free to play so anyone can join in on the fun. I recommend this game to everyone."
"Team Fortress 2, oh man... This game is the game you want to play if you really like shooters - and hats :D - and you want to have some fun. I always try to finish my homework (most of the time I just skip it) to play TF2. This game has 9 classes with every each of them have something to counter, and a class that counters them (exept for pyro, it's OP as ♥♥♥♥). The best weapons in the game, are Stock (the ones you start with) and reskins (just for rich kids) because they have no downside and no upside. You might think ; 'No upside! Well that sucks!' Well no. EVERY single weapon has its moments, even without upsides. The only thing I still can't find is the sprint button (just a damn joke). After all, I really do not recomend not playing this game. &lt;3"
:)
"edit 9/12/2016 this game got me into pc gaming and gaming in general i hate to see it this way  Another negative review possible TL:DR warning  I love this game don't get me wrong its on my list of the best video games and Fps Games of all time and the characters will be remembered in history And it was my first steam game like many  On the night of January 10 2014 well, having a sleep over with my friend I decided to check out a Game Called I heard about it before and My brother recommended, I didn't know it was free a signed up for steam and went to find this Team Fortress 2 Game he was talking about I found and played it for a few minutes instantly enjoyed it and check out some servers I was amazed by the custom maps and mods it had to offer  BUT recently a game came out this game as you all know Overwatch developed by blizzard entertainment the creators of the world famous World of Warcraftators of the world famous World of Warcraft, but this game has turned the community into a living ♥♥♥♥ storm people saying the game will make Team Fortress 2 go extinct that never happen but valve ♥♥♥♥ed it up bad with The Meet Your Match it removed a feature that everyone used quick play and pubs now replaced with matchmaking and thirty minute waiting.   This game is now a shameful CashGrab and over stayed its welcome   I will change my review if the frontline update is a sucess or if valve gives us pubs back  I will stop defending this Game i will accept that this game has jump the shark  i will still try to play this game and put up with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"
Fantasic hats and a decent community 8/10
"Many years ago, some men were concerned about our safety, and so they tried to teach us a dance, and assured us we could leave our friends behind. Unfortunately, the message was lost for one simple, horrible reason. They had no hats. Fast forward to the 21st century, and those who longed for safety and danced remained hatless, with the exception of Prince, who had a thing for certain berets. Then came TF2, which restored hats and dancing to the world. Unfortunately, it might have forgotten the safety part.   The impetus for this culture shift that is Team Fortress 2 was found in the cryptic writings of a large cat with a hearing impairment in ages past. Buried among those ancient words was 'No serenade, no fire brigade, just pyromania.' So it was clear that people should not sing, but rather attack each other with flamethrowers and play air guitar with weapons. It made perfect sense. Meanwhile, while listening to the radio, Mann Co. came to remember that they built this city, and when it was finished the engineers grew restless and bored, and began to struggle with the pyromaniacs. As the arms race escalated, people had to come to terms that in fact this minigun-wielding man, he was not their brother, and that he was, in fact, heavy.   Because of these events, a group of private eyes were hired. They were watching and saw every move. They assured the world 'I'm a spy, but I'm on your side.' When they cried out 'hit me with your best shot, fire away!' in mockery, they were suprised to find sharpshooters from Australia eager to take them up on the offer. The military was called in, to attempt a peaceful resolution. The soldiers called out 'come off your battlefield, lay down your arms and surrender', but the combatants saw their rocket launchers were loaded and aimed, and attacked.   Interestly, some talent scouts for Major League Baseball were on hand, and mistook the melee for a sporting event. Eagerly, one of the scouts shouted 'put me in coach, I'm ready to play', only to be hit in the head with a frying pan. So he called out to the nearest medic. 'Doctor, Mr. MD, won't you tell me what's ailing me?' And he said 'Yeah', before a spy snuck up on him, stabbing him in the back, and the doctor swore eternal revenge.   By then it was clear something needed to be done. So scientists in a remote location in Scotland prepared a weapon against this madness. They spliced the genes of Syvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes together to create a new superhero. His name was The Demolition Man. But this was only a prototype, the Demolition Man Demo, and Taco Bell wasn't sure about the sponsorship.   But then there were the hats. And people stopped fighting amongst themselves to trade these many hats that they wore. Just kidding, they kept killing each other endlessly. But then they questioned the conflict, and it became Mann vs Machine for a time.   The world is a safer place. We can go where we want to. A place that they will never find. We could even act like we're from out of this world, and leave the real one far behind. Because of the wonderful hats, which have brought world peace. Although it looks an awful lot like war."
"Very interesting game, especially with friends. It never gets old and is updated frequently. +10"
10/10 There are hats in this game.
yeah its a pretty good community and u get a good chance to meet many great people 
great game
"A good fun game if you have the patience. The community is mostly friendly some are salty so be advised. If your a parent searching for a review to say yes or no to your kids, Its a good game forr 13+(if mature enough other wise 14-15). The game has blood in it but I never really notice it. Its very cartoony and funny actually when you get blasted to smetheriens. The MVM gamemode is very fun and lucrative in some cases. Hope this review helped &lt;3"
"Very addictive, good community and update-rich."
"I recommend it to all level players, best free to play game!"
This game has changed my life and I'm never going back to the none game playing nerd I was before
"I highly recommend that no one play this game until it's godawful bugs have been fixed. The loading times are horrible and once you finally get into a game it only lasts for about 30 seconds before you're thrown back into the main menu, only to repeat the cycle.   Also with the lack of the ability to autobalance matches, if someone leaves halfway through a match like half of my team did in a previous round, you will then be stuck in a 4 vs 18 spawncamping hellhole and your only choice is to leave the game and let the other team 'win'. The game is near unplayable in it's current state and although there are some good things about this update, the bad things come in a much much larger quantity. Team Fortress 2 was my favourite game until this update arrived and now I'm lucky if I can get 45 seconds of game play before the teams become unbalanced, the game ends (because it often places you in near finished games) or the loading times become too unbearable.   Overwatch didn't kill Team Fortress 2. This update did."
"Ok I love this game alot and there is nothing wrong with it* it is fast paced team based fps and every class is fairly balanced, not to many bugs and has many easter eggs ive played for a while and i love it and everything is fine the community isnt tooo bad and they are pretty accepting and friendly *but here is where the asterisk goes in. the new casual and competitive matchmaking is a disaster it is soooo slow if the developers get the old quickplay back than this would stay my favorite game but if they dont... than the game will die faster it is already a dying game and other games are exceding it it pioneered class based fps' and id hate to see it go hope you found it helpful"
One of the best games I played in a long time. Weapon drop system is a genius idea.
"Other than the recent atrocity that is the 'Meet Your Match' update, Team fortress 2 is one of the best online multiplayer experiences you could possibly ever have. Everything about this game is just fantastic, such as the gameplay, the characters, and the humor is just great. Sure the community can get pretty toxic, especially with trading, but I have also met a lot of nice people through this game. So WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU JUST STANDING THERE FOR!, try this game out, plus this game is free to play so that should be a reason for you to try it out!"
"This game is wacky. All out funny with cartoon like actions, and like the desc of this game...hats! This is by far one of my favorite games."
Really good game I say lots of people use tf2 for trading to get more stuff and sell that stuff for games without having to buy anything or use real life money to get a game but its a littel hard to start off on tf2 without a key or two...
"My best game. Plays well, F2P and P2P, but not FORCING you to have to be P2P. One of the many reasons why I love this game. A few rough updates recently, but still extremely fun to play and recommended to anyone who likes a fun FPS. (Also has conga)."
"This game is fun. I like the silly graphics and the wide variety of classes. It does have some flaws, but they aren't to noticable. I would recomend this to anyone who likes to play FPS type games. And now it is free-to-play witch is really cool."
Great Game 5 Star
fun game thats been ruined by updates. finding a game in matchmaking has completly ruined finding games with my friends
"Remember when we payed $20 for this game?  Yeah, me too."
Its my Favourite Game and i could spent tons of hours playing this Game! Theres so much fun!
im broke because of this game
"It's a fun game, and you can enjoy it with all your friends and the best part, it's free!!!"
Super Dam fun with every update this game gets just makes it better !
Y it not inclood webbz
Your saying hats don't make you better. Words of a wise mann.
"Nice game! I like how the developers have changed the engine, so the graphics are more comic-like. Nice :) Good job x)"
"Team Fortress 2. Ah, how amazing it is. This game is one of the best things to happen to me. Why? Because of the sheer awsomeness of it is hard to understand by using words, but i'll try. This game is a fast paced fps that puts you in a seemingly cartoony world where flying drunken sword swiping bomb chucking sticky trapping black scotish cyclopes exist, you already know this is one of the best f2p games you will pick up. This game is different from all the rest, not only because of how it looks, but of the gameplay and classes avalible. the story is told through comics, and thats fine with me.there are 9 classes, The Scout, a fast running loudmouth from Bosten, The Heavy, a Russin family man that will make you ♥♥♥♥ yourself everytime he opens his mouth, The Engineer, the gentile Texen that can build a sentry that will make your life living hell (if it wasent already), The Demoman, the scotish drunk that you heard about earlyer,The Spy, the french devilish snake that will sneak into the back lines, as well as your mothers bed, The Sniper, a assassin for hire from Austrailia that will take your head off in .5 seconds flat, The Medic, the sasistic healer from Germany that will heal your team as well as stick his medi-gun up the heavys (beeep), The Soldier, the crazy American nut that can blow you into a million giblits, as well as be a flying killing machine that will stick a shovel in the back of your head, and The Pyro, the Pyromaniac that gender is unknown (MatPat's theory has been disproved, sorry) that will w+mi as well as airblast his way through everyone. And that doesnt even cover the gameplay. if you think you should give this game a try, then you are very right. I hope this review helped you, goodbye and gooday, mate (headshots)"
"I'll honestly say, I took me awhile to get used to this game. It's really fun. Don't even think about. Get it, And when it's done, Play it."
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFnNOseN4IY   No further elaboration needed.
"Its free, its fun, and HATS!"
"You can say alot about TF2. But you can't say that it isn't fun. This game is most certainly a perpetual case of fan-service, but in doing this, it's kept itself alive and has only grown in relevance."
"I liked everything about Team fortress two,and i disliked nothing about it.It's a great game"
"Great game, I've had alot of fun with it. Just download it now. It's free and there's no reason not to."
I really have enjoyed this game. Its very fun especially if you like Fisrt Person Shooters. Very Fun :D
One of the best multiplayer games out there.
This game is f2p. Hats are not free. Get hats. Get stranges. Trade. Get unusual hat. Sell for $40. Proceed to spend $40 on more hats.   11/10 potatoes  super kawaii game of the decade hats made me lick the ♥♥♥♥♥ off of my GabeN picture
Got the game at 75% off at the price of free. It was worth it
This game Its The best game Ever :DDDDD !!!!
The best game:D
love this game and the community!
"Updated review on Team Fortress 2:  This game is fun well it was fun until this new update rolled in. In all honesty the Meet your Match update really killed it for me and for a lot of reasons. Valve getting rid of quickplay servers is to me a big mistake seeing that a lot of the community plays on quickplay valve servers. 'Oh but Glutch we got casual mode now stop your whining and accept.' No for the most part I thought all of the big updates to TF2 were really good sure there were some weird changes but usually Valve would fix it but now it seems they really don't care anymore. Pub servers were so popular for many reasons it was a place where many players could play normally not really get into a super comp mode but in some games you could get into that mode. But now they just took that all away and left us with the god awful community servers filled with DUSTBOWL 24/7, MINECRAFT TRADE, and SLENDER HUNTING giving many players not that many options. Also you think Valve would fix the Vac security welp we were wrong again. Hackers can still get into casual servers and by pass the outdated Vac system now thankfully Valve added the option to kick players in casual mode but to me thats not really enough. Valve should be harsh on cheaters since all they do is ruin peoples fun. So the only thing that I wish to return pub servers please Valve it will make many of your fans happy if you make the right decisions and hopefully in the next big update you will learn from your mistakes.  P.S. Its still a fun game but I've just been annoyed lately by Valves recent decisions."
"why should i even write a review on frikkin' TEAM FORTRESS 2?! this game is as good as perfect.almost NO flaws,great cartoon artstyle,differnet classes and different play styles for each class=a recipe for an hilarious and awesome game that your never gonna get bored of. and best of all ITS FREE! and if you wanna 'buy' the game you only gotta spend 5 cents.  final thing to say:if someone dares to say that tf2 is a stupid/bad game,then you are allowed to slap that person in the face and give him/her a ransid NOPE.avi"
"Amazing game to play, it's free!"
"Hats, GabeN and Random Crits. Enjoy my F2P Gibus Friends"
"Literally my favorite shooter of all time. The game never gets old, the community is astounding, the characters are well-written, and the gameplay is always fun.  There are those that think TF2 is dead or all the people online are just sitting around trading, if you are one of those people, please direct your attention to:   http://store.steampowered.com/stats/    http://tf2center.com/    http://www.tf2pug.me/    http://www.ugcleague.com/    https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2    https://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2   And multiple other sites.   I have heard people call TF2 'pay 2 win', and that is simply not true. Actually, a good chunk of the time the stock weapons are better than weapons you get from drops/crates/etc. The weapons you can buy from the store can also come as drops, be purchased cheaply through trading through sites like scrap.tf (we are talking 2 weapons for 1 scrap, which is worth no more than 3 cents), or traded from friends or players in game. Those strange/killstreak/unusual items you get from crates? Those properties are purely cosmetic and give you absolutely no benefit in game.  Yes, TF2 can be competitive as well. Just because it's a silly game does not mean it can't be competitive. TF2 is possibly the most balanced game I have ever played, with a few exceptions (*cough loch'n'load cough*). These exceptions are usually banned in competitive via whitelists to make the gameplay fair for everybody. Every class/weapon has a counter.  While its true TF2 trading is dying out because of players moving to CS:GO trading, the game itself is not even close to dead.  TF2 has not been abandoned by valve. As a matter of fact, an   Alien Invasion update   will be upon us shortly, and no thats not conspiracy. This is the same way valve lead up to the MVM update which you can learn about   Here  . Thats not including the upcoming Spy vs Engineer update.   I can wholeheartedly reccomend this game to anyone who has not tried it, as it is a fantastic game and a great mulitplayer experience."
This is a good game it is fun :P
"if you have a computer and dont own this game, your missing the point of having a computer"
Team Fortess 2 is the only game that takes revenge and trolling to the next level besides DarkRP. In Team Fortress 2 you can find yourself in a boxing match with three heavies that are all wearing hats that have magically burst into flames or shooting a 6'4 Australian man in the face with a pistol 14 times only to be awarded with a fist sending you straight to your grave.
"Team Fortress 2, I believe, will be the future of FPS games. Unlike other games where your just running around spraying automatic rifles, this game involves teamwork, and has 9 classes to help do this. Its all evenly balanced, with every class able to counter another class and every class having a counter. Theres also a wide range of weapons to customize your loudout. They also have many kinds of fun game modes, both official and community made. To top all of this off, if you're a hardcore gamer like me, you can play Competitive, which is a more highly skill based teams fighting each other. There's two verions of competitive; 6's, where it is 2 scouts, 2 soldiers, 1 demo, and 1 medic on each team; and there is highlander, which is 1 of every class. no matter the gamemode you and your teammates will be on the mic relaying info to each other, such as if a enemy is hurt or if someone is down."
Like a WB cartoon. Except you get to shoot them in the head.
this game gucci boi
not much replay value
let me tell you a story  one day  i had money.  *team fortress 2 happens*  the next day  i had no money.  --  insufficient funds/10
The best game in years :D
15/10
AWESOME game i really like the cartoony effect to this game. SO cool
I think that this game have a lot to offer. It is old but the community is strong and the game by itself is fun and easy but hard to master .
I really like this new update :D
Fun but the game is one of the best f2p games i ever played (BALANCED AS ♥♥♥♥) :3 also Valve-anti-cheat make it 2fun XD but if you want this game only f2p you WILL get bored /: cuz you keep seeing everyone with a hat.
this game is a classic that everyone should play. I like how u can get different weapons but it can take a while which one of the downfalls of this game if you arent super rich. when i am at the steam store i also cant sell any team fortress two items but i think that is because i had to buy the game when it came out.   still this game is awesome 10/10
Funny Graphics Cool Gameplay   and most important thing is  THIS GAME IS FREE
Worst three thousand hours of my life
I did this for the achievement.
"What's amazing about this game, is that if valve never made any more updates for this game, the community, even the game itself, could sustain itself, ab kept alive for a very long time. It's almost as if it was made to be alive forever. Crafting, trading, inventory, cards, item drops, events, it's all here. The gameplay is fun, gory, querky, and addicting: everything you need in a game. The absence of an assault rifle is another thing that makes it stand out. It doesn't need to be like COD, or halo, it is what it is, and that's what makes it better than others. It has bird heads, sandwiches, more birds, shotguns, and everything. I highly recomend it. Best game ever."
Second best game on my library. Five stars.
"Very fun to play in pubs, with friends, trade servers, or just trading hats :D"
"it started fun, i didnt understand a thing. 2 years and over 1000 hours later i dont understand the people. still fun but it doesnt stand alone if u want to go beyond 1000 you need other games to avoid burnout. or the trading and the youtube community."
If this game was a potato it would be a great potato!
"The GoldenPan is all I need to say, it is an all class weapon which is literally as the name says; a Golden Frying Pan. This item originally sold for $5000 USD and there is an entire community based around the trading mechanic of what is a solid arena shooter.  I mostly play this game as a social experiment as this community is full of Trolls, Furrys, bronies, annoying children and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s alike!  I have only dabbled in the trading side of things a little and just grabbed some nice looking cosmetics, but I’m not so great at the core game either (which is a really damn good btw) as I normally play a community game mode called surf which is based off a glitch with the physics engine (source).  Personally I enjoy playing it, I mostly play Call of duty 89 which has a much more serious tone to it so it’s great to be able to play something random and ♥♥♥♥ about with people. "
It's hat simulator at its finest. The classes are all diverse and are fun to mess around with. The amount silly community servers is never ending and if you and some semi competent players queue up for some comp or casual it should be a fun time. Beware of the f2p and rise the ranks to be the best p2p. Good luck.
very fun and addicting
thanks i spent all my money on this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game
THAT SANDVICH IS A SPY!
Amazing game fun weapons nice grafics and smooth gameplay
"CS:GO-Comic relief edition.  The colorful guns are cute and fun, but this isn't what the game needed. You countered a lousy update with another lousy update. I can't not reccomend this game, but really. Don't let it die on us. Not like this."
"Team Fortress 2 is the most realistic hat simulator created to date. There is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one. The first time you start the simulator, you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items. If you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame, you get your very first hat: the Gibus. This is where it really starts; To play the simulator correctly, you have to spend money in the market place, made by Valve. After that, while you play the minigame, you can find hats which you can trade for, or collect! There is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats, just like you! After you collect enough items and/or hats, try joining a trade server! There, the REAL fun begins! Good luck, and beware of ending up poor!"
Awesome Game would buy and play more :) Pay 2 win :)
I can feel myself slipping into the void. i just bought my first hat. I... I... I need more..... I cant explain the urge... The urge to just take all of my money and spend it on virtual hats...... Someone help us.    UHHHH ISS A GOOD GAM 10\10
this game is the best to play
"This is awesome, I play it almost everyday."
"Well ,if you have steam you probably already know tf2, you know 20/10 Ign 9999/100 metascore pretty much the best game ever. Dont forget: Hats mean op so this game is a super p2w.If someone doesn't have a hat he is 100% a Nube  My favourite class is the spy. Enjoy and have fun.  -Lord GabeN"
Hat Simulator 2 is an all-around great game and has been for a long time
"Great old school FPS/class oriented game. Lil laggy at times, but if you join a server with medium players rather than max, it's better. Overall, it's a good time killer. :D"
"Truly amazing game, and its been like that for the past 7 years! From the day I started, I have thoroughly enjoyed this game. Valve has chose and done bad mistakes, but people just shake it off, and deal with it. The trading system is very good but Pishers came with it aswell, that can upset some people after clikcing a link. Otherwise, a extraodinary game indeed."
"I Love this game. Team Fortress 2 I think is a really good Multiplayer Game I love the trading community, The gameplay and even the updates. For a Game that came out in 2006 or 2007 i dont remember but this game has come a long way sence then. Also from how long it took for this game to come out It's a masterpeace I think. I dont Think theres anything that could be a better game. You should get this game I highly Recommend It :3"
"Great for casual play, great for competitive play, great characters 'n humour, mostly well-balanced, and still updated consistently.   Not to mention arguably the best monetary system in a F2P game."
"Team Fortress 2 is awesome. You can play lot of gamemodes and have fun with friends and if you are lucky, you can get cool items. There are characters with their unique abilities."
THIS GAME IS AMAZING AND ONE OF THE BEST FPS I'VE EVER PLAYED!!! YOU MUST DOWNLOAD IT NOW!!!!!
:)
"The multiplayer is amazing,the hilarity of the characters makes you want to play more and their personalitys could not be anymore well put into a shooter,the large variety of customization of your character,your weapons,nearly everything that involves yourself,the whole game is amazing but sometimes the prices for items can be slightly overboard,I understand Valve is trying to earn money for all their hard work but the prices don't need to be that high,the trading system was a very good add on to the game,letting fellow players trade off for the items they desire,now the scammers are an issue to the system,maybe a new player has a valuble item and they get scammed off with a cheap item worth nearly nothing and the victim would not know it,so the only issues really are the scammers,overpriced items,the wasting of money from keys to get items not even priced close to the key's amount,the chances of unusuals are very low,they may be rare but people are using their money on keys to get great items not a ripoff,and besides that,the game is great,probably one of the best shooters in my gaming life,good job Valve,keep up the good work"
Right great game... 8/8 m8
really good game you should download this game its pretty awesome
Great game this game will keep you coming back for a long time. I highly recommend it as a gaming must have
"TF2. One of my reason of why I'm even on Steam. Its fun. Its Multiplayer. Its TF2. From Scout (Annoying, But Fast Character) To Heavy (Slow, Overweight , But has a Minigun) To finally, The Spy (Backstabbin Son Of a..) and many more classes. This is one hell of a game. And its free!"
"After many trials and tribulations this game has suffered over the years with fluxuating updates, this is still one of my favorite PC games, and you should at least give it a try."
This is the best game ever!!! 20/10! :D
"Great game, and Free-to-Play! Amazing!"
"before I start I'll say not to have ANY kind of game monitor open, like MSI Afterburner, because the game freezes at the valve logo.  I will say I haven't played since summer 2015, but before that I played this like it was the best game ever made. well I recently decided it was more than reasonable to download this and play it more if I like it so much more than my other games. well, 1 year later, the game got a total overhaul in UI, and servers, now including an XP system. at first I though 'Awesome! they gave it a breath of life, as if it even needed one though'. turns out it really didn't. I can see how this can become a good thing, but I'd rather have my beloved 2009-2015 style back. they never changed much because why fix whats not broken? well unless they do a lot. it now suck, and I'm sad to say that. look for Whiplash141 's review for a more well written review detailing the issues. if it changes back, I can't reccomend this game enough, but till then its a thumbs down.  Edit: I should add that it took me a total of 36 mins of having the game open to connect to 2 matches that were ending, and 1 match that didn't last long because you no longer join a game that plays till X points in X time, then imediately connect to another. instead you play to 1 point and leave to wait in another 8 min server"
best game ever created
"This game... still one of the   best   free to play games available. With it's 9 classes and god-knows-how-many items to craft/find and equip, it offers a great amount of options and variety to change and expand your playstyle. Simple and intriguing at the same time."
Play for fun!:)
it's ok
"This great game is played by thousands of people and is a lot of fun. The game is updated regularly providing players with new and fun content. Although the game features payed-for items such as hats and weapons, the game is not pay to play and you will not be at a disadvantage if you do not buy them.  + Can spend hundreds of hours on this game.  + Free game!  + Lots of content and more being added.  + Large and (mostly) friendly community.  + Very fun with friends.  + Visually pleasing graphics style."
10/10 ITS SO ♥♥♥♥ING AWSOME IT GETS YOU MORE HYPE THAN COCAINE
Ruined my life but for some reason it's still fun 10/10
this is one of the best f2p games in history get this game now!
Nice game!
Nice pootis game c:
"Team Fortress 2  Pretty much the best game I have ever played. Like, if you asked me to make a list. It would be #1.  Why? Because it is the most polished, most developed, most played, least buggy, and most balanced game I have ever played.  Other than that, it's just a load of fun. Just something about the game makes it loads of absolute fun for both a main game and a game on the side.  If you haven't played, what are you waiting for? DOWNLOAD. If you still dout how much of a good game this is. My user name and my profile picture were based off of TF2."
This should be in every steam users game libary
"Amazing Game,F2P,great gamestyle!"
A very good game in multiplayer.
"Idk what to say, but I like this game, It makes me happy while playing it."
I have an addiction. Please help me.
"Really nice game.  You should try it, very fun :D"
So great I had to make a review on my other account about it!
you have to pay 18 euros/dollars just to play one match!
yes i can idle here 24/7
"Tired of COD? Want to get back to your Online-Shooter Games? Well you're in luck son, you're playing Team Fortress 2! You can find random items! If you buy somthing off the Mann Co. Store, You're going to have a nice time, trading, possibly ragequiting, 'GET OWNED YOU DUMBASS ♥♥♥♥♥!' time!"
"Good game, but when I first downloaded I couldn't play [That was when I had a XP, now I have a 7] and this game is really good, 9/10"
"Great game, didn't expect to like it THIS much. :)"
hats
"Team fortress 2 is besides its power over persuation a verry good, awesome, mind blowing game. Who, despite the fact that it has been created in a verry light colour(wich I appreciate), is sutable for all first person shooters who are looking for a bit of imagination but still want a verry imposant game.  There for I recommand this game verry much!! (thanx for reeding)"
It's the best game on Steam.
"INTRODUCTION: Flash-back to Summer 2011. I was on my Xbox 360. playing Team Fortress 2 on The Orange Box. I didn't have a gold membership, so I didn't get to play with anyone. Pretty boring. Flash-forward October 2014. I was browsing on Steam and I saw Team Fortress 2! Finally! I get to properly play this game. Well not exactly, 'cause I didn't have a proper PC to play it. A lag-filled disaster! But flash-forward to Christmas 2014. I finally get a $500 AMD build. Not perfect for the latest games, but not bad for my first gaming PC. I re-installed Team Fortress 2 on it and then started playing. Little by little, my enjoyment for this game kept on growing and I still love playing it!  PROS: + Great gameplay! + Constantly updating, so there's always new stuff to try. + Tons of characters, weapons, items, maps and unlockable achievements to keep you busy for a long time!  + Free-to-play! + Doesn't require a good PC to run. + Barely any hackers! + Great community! + Has variety.  CONS: - Can sometimes get kicked out of a server for no good reason.  CONCLUSION: So if you don't have a good machine and are looking for a fun experience, look no further!  FINAL SCORE: 9.5/10"
Sniper is a good job mate.
Team Fortress 2 is a fun online game with friends. It's so fun judging from CTF to CP to even parkour!  Play it now! it's free!!
"The well known, and appreciated War Themed Hat Simulator, AKA Team Fortress 2. Fantastic game with truly awesome gameplay that does not focus on being realistic, just fun!  Unlike many other multiplayer shooters, this one requires a lot of teamwork, hence the title, which can be either rarther frustrating or just plain fantastic!   The feeling of when you and your team smashes through the enemy defenses and when you help each other out defeating the enemy is something to experience... You won't find this anytime soon in CoD kids...  But of course, there are also some bad sides to the fact that teamwork is such a key element. Often it is seen that a lot of new players decide to go the class that they like- This is problematic since a full 10-man team of snipers simply will have a lot more trouble taking down a sentry nest than a single demoman and medic.  Morale is that you have to balance the classes so you have enough of everything.   There are a lot of unlockable weapons in the game, but you don't get them by 360'ing 30 people in a row... It's random drops, and to some extent achievement milestones (But not that much really...) Most weapons are simply sidegrades, so there aren't many weapons that are just better! Pretty much everything is balanced.   As a final note, there are cosmetics in this game! YEY! These doesn't change anything particular important, even though people love 'em. Just collect them as an extra mini-game! It is not what the entirety is about :)  The game is free! So yeah... Go have yourself a good time"
"I dont know it use to be good, but know it just a pay to win game, sence when does the size of ones wallet = skill ?, its a real shame, i see so many hacks being used in every round, aim bot, god mode, etc. Its says if cheat u get banned what a joke, This is distastefui i have seen so many players just cheating away with nothing to worry about, i cant even take this for a real fps game, they had it write the 1st time, went pay to win and its just down hill from the point on. And no i dont recommed this game to anyone for the simple reason there a more cheaters then liget players flat out."
"Best game ever: Addictive gamepley, check, Hats, check, Guns, check, team work, check."
"I think there are enough reviews to show that this game is highly recommended, but here's another anyway.  TF2 manages to do a few things quite flawlessly: 1. Classes. TF2 has 9 very distinct classes, each with a very different style of gameplay attached to them, making the game very replayable.  2. Clarity. TF2 is a very approachable game, as the classes are very well defined and their roles (from the eyes of a newbie) are fairly clear. The art style in the game also makes it very approachable, catering for pretty much all audiences.  3. Variety. To add on to the classes being varied, there is also a massive set of weapons, which range from minor cosmetic differences to completely different utilities, making weapon combinations become something personal that you can tailor to your style of play. TF2 also boasts a decent range of game-modes, from CTF to Capture Points, to King of the Hill, and even a vastly different co-op mode MvM (Mann vs. Machine).   4. Community. TF2 has a very active trading scene, competitive lobby and league scene, and Steam Workshop. Many items created by fans of the game have ended up being implemented, producing revenue for the artist and Valve itself, which leads onto my final point:  5. Free-to-play done right. Their monetisation methods are non-intrusive and not in your face. There is incentive to gamble with crates for strange/unusual items through buying 'keys', but in the end the high-tier loot are all COSMETIC in nature, rather than unlocking some weapon with vastly OP stats like so many other F2P games. Everything that can be bought can also be traded for, and with the activity of the community it is not too difficult a feat to do. The game also provides you with free items based on play time, which can of course be traded, and non-tradable basic weapons for completing achievement milestones with the different classes.  All in all, it's a great class-based shooter/hat simulator with a great setup behind it. Go play!"
one of the greatest game ever
"DO NOT PLAY THIS VERSION OF TF2!  Holy sh it, Team Fortress 2 was one of my favorite games and actually the first game I ever played on steam. I have been gone for 8 months off of steam and I came back to try tf2 on my new laptop. I was expecting to join a valve matchmaking server and play the spy. I was wrong  When I downloaded TF2 and launched it, something was different. The menu looked like donkey s hit, and quickplay was gone, replaced with casual, competitive, and other options. I was p issed. I wasn't sure if I launched tf2 or csgo. Casual takes years to put me into a match as when I used quickplay, I was put in a match within seconds and you could actually stay on the same server. Casual forces you to quit once the map is finished and thats bulls hi t. I tried to like casual but I just can't. I put 20 hours into casual and I hated it. Not to mention the tf2 community, possibly the most cancerous community on the internet next to bronies, undertale, and furries. The community is full of re ♥♥♥♥♥ who spend their mom's welfare money for virtual weapons and hats to trade away. The economy of that welfare money trading is also going down the sh itt er. Mann Co. Supply Crate Keys used to be 3 ref each, which was awesome. You could actually make money by crafting items you got from random drops. Wanna guess what the price of the keys are now? FUC K ING 19 REF! That's nearly 6 times more than the original price. It's because the f aggots at backpack.tf don't know how to maintain the economy and use the economy to benefit themselves. They know when the price is going to change. They know how to turn a profit. They even fu cked over the most valuable piece of currency in the game. Earbuds used to be 19 keys, now they are f ucking a whopping 2.2 keys. wow man. Enough about the community and now onto more of valve.  Valve, F uc k y o u. You money-grabbing sl uts. You are trying to make tf2 cs:go so bad, that you copied the gamemodes from csgo. You copied weapons skins and inspecting weapon skins and next thing you know, there will be a de_dust 2 map. You also ♥♥♥♥ed over alot of weapons and broke the game trying to compete with overwatch. Give us quickplay and my tf2 back you c u n t s. I geniunely upset on how this game has progressed.    Sincerely, A concerned steam user."
"A greate game to play with friends that never gets old.(the game, not your friends) With endless updates and patches, you'll never run out of wepons and hats to play with!"
This game is a simple must have and guess what ITS FREE
Holy this is freakin aweome
Good But Need Hats To Play Well
Good graphics. Team fun. Much hats. Much wow.
"obviously, one of the best if not THE best f2p there is on steam"
"Do I really need to say something about it? GO GET THE FREAKING GAME ALREADY. One of the best FPS's out there, been playing it since 2008. Endless fun, not to talk about the awesomeness of the hats and its amazing community. Go get it!"
This Game is Amazing i really recommend Team Fortress 2
"Great game, I'd say nice people, but that isn't always the case. I know Valve is trying all they can to make TF2 a better, safer experience, but it'd really help if they added some sort of, kick-from-tf2 thing. To give hackers a better idea of what will happen if they keep doing what they're doing.   I like the hats, keeping in touch with my friends, but most importantly, I love the unique-ness. Most Free to Play games are not entirely invigorating, but Team Fortress 2 breaks that line. Team Fortress 2 is the best Free to Play game I know, being it has great community, makes great animation partnered with Source Film-maker, and most importantly gives me something to say to others, 'Yes. I play Team Fortress 2. Got a problem?' I am a proud player of the game."
This game has it all action drama explosion(michael bay even masturbated) even hats that cost more than real hats tho.But do not forget the mechanics and the most important IT IS JUST 4FUN. No rages like in LoL.Just play for your self. Objectives? ♥♥♥♥ them.
"This game is great to play with friends. What makes this game so awesome is that paying players are just as good as non-paying players, unlike most FTP games. It is not just 'pay to win'. Also all the weapons are perfectly balanced in my opinion. If you found a weapon, it is just different, rather than better. The regular updates show that the developers pay attention to the game, eventhough it is pretty old already."
Note : Along with the hours i have on this account i also have 730 on an old account .  After playing by the summer of 2013 till now i have to tell i have completely fried my brain . This game will destroy your money and life ( sarcasm levels are high right now ) . The nostalgia i feel when i remember my first hours as a free 2 play....the best hours in my opinion . And even though i slowly quit the game i cannot give it a bad review since it taught me Steam and and helped me find some of the greatest people i've met online . I salute you TF2 community!!!
"You probably know what this game is. Lets be honest, everyone has probably heard of Team Fortress 2 the moment they got on steam. Team Fortress 2 is a free-to-play shooter with a cartoony art style, and an unusual way of playing that sets it apart from other shooters. In Team Fortress 2, there are 9 classes, each with its weaknesses and advantages. Along with the basic shooting, classes have their own unique abilities that help on the battlefield. However, this game is not only famous for the click &amp; shoot, it has one of the most interesting (and complicated) economy that I enjoy to participate in. You can work your way up to be able trade in-game items for actual steam games. This game also doesn't tax your machine and even on low settings is lovable with it's computer-friendly artstyle. Even though it's been released a long time ago, Team Fortress 2 still maintains it's freshness and uniqueness."
that is cool game :) l like it so much :D
Great game will reccomend to anyone who likes to not take games to seriously but still wants to play
"I can't believe I haven't written a review about Team Fortress 2 yet, since I've pretty much centered my spare time around it.  It's a Valve title. It's free to download. Pick it up.  You're browsing the Steam reviews for a free game. May I ask why you're here? Go help the needy or something. Then, after a hard day of helping the needy, kick back and relax with a few matches of TF2."
"If you're a fan of fast paced, cartoon like games... Then this is the game for you!  Favourite Features: It is filled with quirky comments and cool gadgets! That freeze frame you get of the person, covered in blood, that just blew your head off your shoulders!  Least Favourite Feature: Sometimes the long respawn delays. There are no hit markers, which I think this game REALLY needs!  Overall it's a kinda fun game to play, but I honestly dont enjoy it so much!  I rate it a 6/10"
"Addicting, i would explain reasons and whatnot, but i would rather use the time to go play Team Fortress 2."
spent so much money on this game I could have bought 2 not f2p games.   would like to spend my money again 10/10
I LOVE THE CONGA
"Well there is only a couple of words for this game. These words would be Amazing, Good, and Fun. Tf2 is a very good well balanced free to play game. It's very good and worth the play time. I would recommend getting this game because its a very good game and is also free. Just get the game if you don't have it yet."
this is a very fun and enjoyable game that is great to play friends with and never get bored
"I'll be honest about this game, I was semi hestant about playing it because of its free2play and only multiplayer experiences, oh how I thought wrong. I never though a game about the cliche' of hats, taunts, and 9 classes could be so fun. Plus I met with a variaty of people along the way.  Trust me, there is basically a section for all people, trading, competive, casual, minigame minun, you'll find your groove and mix and have fun with the game overall.  And once you buy somthing from the mannco store(giftpault), congrats! you are p2p. have fun. o/' 9/10  EDIT: July 6th, 2015  I decided to come back to this and give another review with an update called the Gun Mettle. This update caused plenty of commotion, but I'll state my opinions.  The change made this into what people are dubbing. TF:GO or CS:2 ... somthing like that. In short terms, it took the ideas of CS:GO and placed them into TF2, for example, new weapon skins, new crates, picking up weapon drops, etc.   Does this affect me though? In a way, yes. though this game has changed it's identity to become a CS:GO like function wise, It drew me in as a very nice go back to the game as I was getting tired of it. It's still a class based game with enough difference to not compare with CS:GO.  TL:DR - It's has CS:GO ideas, but it's still it's own fun game none the less."
The best!
"TF2 is a game that I, on multiple accounts, have accumulated about 3,000 hours on. I love it to death. I'm even happier that it is still WELL populated and regulated. If you are looking to buy TF2, here are a few things you might want to know.  Pros:  Skill-based yet accessible gameplay. TF2 is a perfect mix of difficulty, with each class giving a different level of skill. With some very basic twitch skills you can do quite well. At the same time, with practice you can become a god of the field, dominating enemies with a long range rocket hitting them in the air.   Gameplay suited to you. Different classes and weapons offer you any placestyle, suited to you.   Balanced gameplay. All of the weapons, classes, and mechanics of TF2 feel well-tested for balance. There are few items that are unbalanced, and none that are gamebreaking.  Team-based gameplay. As the name implies, a good team is needed to win. You will get more-or-less randomly paired with a team. You don't necessarily have to be good: you just have to contribute.   F2P in the best sense. You do not need to buy anything to be good or have fun in TF2. While you cannot trade or find hats as a F2P, those are very little things that do not affect most gameplay.  Plenty of gamemodes and maps. Team Fortress 2 keeps the gameplay fresh with plenty of new maps and old, and many gamemodes.   Constantly updated. Valve still updates TF2, and even when major updates are scarce, they still care for the game. The community is very much alive as well.  Cons:  Bad community. There are many good people who play TF2, but there are an equal number of bad who play it too. Nothing can take the fun out of a game of TF2 more than some embittered teammate complaining about how bad you are doing. There are all manner of villainy (I love that word) in the game: scammers who dedicate their existence to getting virtual items with no effect on gameplay, annoying players who key-bind after every kill, little children who think they're in charge (those are more cute than annoying) and elitist players who will scorn you for every failure. The last is perhaps the most irritating: there is many a player who, at the first sight of you being new or bad, will not hesitate to call you a noob or otherwise call you out. There are also many who judge your skill based on your number of hats: I recall on one occasion a behatted P2P getting dominated by a F2P who was better than him, and remarking that the F2P was 'lucky' and was a 'noob.' It was deplorable. I advise going into the game with a thick skin.   All in all, I give TF2 a 8.5/10. The game is the best-made I have ever played, and although the community can be a bother, the game itself is remarkably solid. Also, if you don't like it...well, it's free. Seriously, go download it right now. RIGHT NOW.  "
"Team fortress 2 Review @30/12/2014 'End of Year review' 'Nine distinct classes provide a broad range of tactical abilities and personalities. Constantly updated with new game modes, maps, equipment and, most importantly, hats!' As it says in the games own description the most important thing is Hats!  Team fortress 2 is a first person FPS with a vast item base and many community created maps and modding equipment which will allow the player to full change everything about the game be it the in-game Heads up Display (HUD), Weapon skins, Hats, Players etc... with ease, Since Team Fortress's realse it has gone through massive changes, The overall balance of classes is perfect some of them are better against overs but they are never overpowered even when the game adds new weapons and changes it never becomes inbalanced.  This game also has the biggest trading community in existence, I thought it was massive inside games such as 'World of Warcraft' and 'Dota 2' Team fortress's tradig is by far the most indepth and interesting community, The trading system is easy to get used to thanks to the many 3rd party websites which update prices on a regular basis.  The best thing about Team fortress 2 however is its gameplay, The maps appear to be endless thanks to the tons of community made maps and already official Valve created maps, Valve has also taken this into granted by giving this game the biggest workshop community allowing players to create amazing maps, hats, misc and new weapons to be added to the game in either little patchs at times or biig community updates or festivals inside the game so the game is always feeling alive.  Only con I could think of is some of the fanbase can be rather harsh to new players, I have played the Xbox version starting off and moving to the pc version and now racking up almost 1,000 hours on other accounts starting off can be rough on some servers.  Overall the game is worth playing, If you are not into the genre you should at least test it out and try it for yourself."
THIS GAME IS GERD 
very nice game
"So I wasted over a 1 hour doing nothing but dacing Conga in this game, where I am supposed to shoot people and push a bomb.  It was the best match ever. 11/10"
Made of win.
  Oktoberfest!! I have been playing this game for a while now and I enjoy its creativity on weapons secret features and even maps. Its a game that I call a pick-up-and-get-started game with adequate controls for beginners though there are some other buttons you need to know but they even have tutorials to show you how to use them. Theres more weapons and classes but i dont want to spoil all them for you :) . The game even has different game types and more coming! This game is SO fun with all these features in the same place this cant be boring. A little rage from the game but still its a wonderful game with awesome mechanics so i suggest in 110% ! And do you know what else is great about the game? ITS FREE!!! But you have to pay 1.00 yes 1 little dollar for premium! I reccomend this game for its wonderful weapons that give you a new playstyle!! So what are you waiting for? Play it!!!
i really enjoy this game and the good part is that it's free!!!! 
Good Game :) Get It Now!
"This game is so fun, its fast paced and fillled with various gamemodes, try it out"
This is a fun free to play game. huge emphisis on team work. the game modes vary outside of normal play like rocket jump maps etc. its frustraiting at first leanring the characters and each characters attributes. after you get the hang of it its HIGHLY addictive!
so far this game has always been the the game closest to my heart as it is my very first pc game a long time ago(a year ago so its not soo long) when i first played the game i loved it as the years go by i enjoy playing tf2 and theres alot friendly ppl too(good community excet for those who wants to be a troll)and yes for those of u who cant afford games like cs:go and cetra u should get this game as it is a free to play game and yes i recommend this to ALL of u just dont be an ♥♥♥♥♥ while playing u can get banned for that.
"The expirience for this game is magical &gt;at first&lt; but the more you play the more you realize its a complete cash grab from valve. The only reason this game is still being updated is to stop it from dying, because its a good income maker for valve. None of the devs give a flying fish about this game anymore.  Not to mention the players, community and pretty much anyone who plays it. They're all mlg memer's who attempt to be funny by going 'friendly hoovy.'  Just don't play this game, save yourself the heartache."
Havn't Played To Much But... Its Pretty Cool I Guess
Best game to play while listening to Skrillix.  11/10
"Best game ever, I got it for christmas, and have played it non-stop. I rek n3rds. You should get it so I can rek you, too. :)   ;c"
free game with expensive hat ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
"Nice game, only bad thing: community."
"This game is a skill-based, humorous first-person shooter. If your looking for something to do with your time, or simply want a casual rocket-them-up, this game is for you."
"(IF PARENTS ARE READING TO SEE IF THIS GAME IS OK FOR YOUR CHILD SKIP TO THE BOTTOM)  Since nobody has written a serious review and your probably biting your fingernails whether or not you should dowload this game I will. I may just have 67 hours but that is still a lot of experience. TF2 (Team Fortress 2) is a class based game. The Spy- He has the ability to disquise himself has one of the enemy team members. He also has the ability to cloak and get out of situations. There are also unlockables in the game. To name a few of Spy's he has a Your Eternal Reward. You lose your disquising kit but upon a succesful backstab you instantly disquise as them. Aslo dead ringer where you can fake your own death. The Medic- He is probably the most important class in competitive play. He has the abllity to heal teamates quickly, has an insanely awesome melee arsenal, and can build up a ubercharge while healing teamates to make both of you invincible at the same time. Medic also has unlockables. The Sniper- Just as he sounds. A headshot with his hlfway charged sniper will nearly gurantee an instant kill (unless it is a heavy) Sniper also has a good melee arsenal and his secondary isnt very good. Trade it out for a Razorback. Prevent spies from backstabbing you the first time while your scoping in, or jarate, throw pee at enemies to make them vulnerbal to mini crits with your sniper or melee weapon. The Demoman- He has a gernade launcher which can be powerful at some points, he also has a sticky launcher. It shoots sticky bombs at any surfac e and you can right click to make them explode. His melee arsenal is awesome too. (Actually nearly every class has an awesome melee) The eyelander. Chops enemy heads off and blood splattering everywhere. Also onee secondary is a shield which gives yiu the power to charge at enemies at a ridicoulousy (pardon my english) fast speed. You dont need to equip that in order to do that either so the charge and eyelander are a great mix. Oh and did I mention that he can stickky jump. shoot two stickies on the ground. Hover over and jump and blow them up at the same time to fly around the map. FLIPPING AWESOME. The Heavy- This class has the most health and firepower in the game and the slowest. You might be thinking well he is overpowered. Especially if he is paired with a medic. But he is not, It is not likely you can take him on your own. But maybe a soldier there and a sniper there perhaps and demoman and medic there can take him down. It requires teamwork. Note with that many people it will probably take 5-10 seconds to take him down unless he is paired with a medic then 15-20 seconds. The heavy's main is a minigun and all he has is miniguns for his primary and thats AWESOME. I love miniguns. The heavy's secondary is a shotgun (Looks awkard in his humongous hands) or a sandvich (Tasty loooking sandwich) Which can heal him if he is low on health and there are no medics nearby. Aslo his melee is his FISTS. You can equip him bare fisted or have a vairety of boxing gloves for him. The Engineer.- Perhaps his loadout is not the most important but his abilities are. The Engineer's main is a bunch of different shotguns (note when I say different weapons those weapons can be completely different with there different powers) some wrenches (for his awesome creations) and a pistol. Now he has a currency which is metal. If you pull out your contruction PDA you can build a sentry, dispensers, and a teleporter entrance and exit. First of you start with 200 metal (That is the max metal u can have) You should build a dispenser first. The dispenser can supply you with metal, health and ammo, it will aslo supply your teamates with health and ammo so thats cool. Then you can level your dispenser to a level 2 and 3 to supply you and your teamates faster. Now build your sentry (130 metal I think) It starts off as a small sentry but if you hit it with your wrench you can level it up to a ultra machine gun sentry. Level 3 includes rockets with your machine gunning sentry. But watch out for any suspicous teamates. They could be a spy and they could sap your sentry and destroy it. (I forgot to mention the spy could do that sorry) Same for your dispensers and teleporters. Now on to teleporters. when your playing a gamemode like Attack/Control when you respawn it can be a painful trip to walk to the frontlines. So you can build a teleporter! Build your entrance and exit. But dont forget to level them up to level 3 because there are charges between teleports (which can be dreadfully long) The good part is you dont need to level them up seperately. As you level up your exit your entrance levels up so thats cool. The Scout- He is the fastest class but has the least health. THE SPEED IS MUCH LIKE QUAKE. I like to think of Scouts primary as his speed because it is very lethal to other slow moving classes but his primary is a epic shotgun arsenal whether it has an insane knockback or a crazy mini crit in close quarters it is going to punish you for messing with you but if you manage to push him back he will just finish you off with his pistol. His melee is awesome like the sandman. If you charge it up you can hit a ball at an enemy and stun them (They cannot shoot and walk faster) for a moment. The scout is important for capturing points because he captures points twice as fast as other classes. The Soldier- His main weapon is a rocket launcher! Then a shotgun or buff banner which can momentarily grant you and nearby teamates mini crits with every shot that the enemies deal, but requires to be charged. There are other like the rocket boots too. His melee arsenal on the other hand is terrible. Just stick with the stock shovel they give you. Though the soldier doesnt sound like much he is very important and can go on sprees but his most important ability is rocket jumping. Go find a youtube video of it. Type in 'TF2 Rocket Jumping and find a video. It's hard to explain. The Pyro- His primary is the flamethrower, a shotgun or different flare guns, and some good melee weapons. He is porbably one of the most feared classes on the field especially for spies. If they are disquised in accidentally walk into the crossfire of a pyro's flamethrower it can reveal his diquise. The meet the pyro video is self explanatory. Trading-Now this game has a very unique trading system. With metal being the currency. People trade hats for metal, key or buds. Trading servers are your best chance for selling something like a bills hat but sometimes you can just go on regular servers. Find some trading guides for more information Game Modes- There are games like Payload where you escort a bomb to a location where it will blow up Attack/Control where one team defends some points or attacks them Payload Race Just like Payload except there are two of them and you have to race each other King of the Hill It's just plain King of th Hill Capture The Flag You just capture each other's flag Special Delivery Deliver a pack of Australium to a rocket ship There are also special game modes like Halloween that come out every holdiday  Let me know if I forgot one abd by the way I have no favorite I jump around to every game mode once in a while The Store- The sotre is where you can buy every item in the game. Hats are the most popular and people are obsessed with them. They basically dont play Team Fortress 2 but Hat Fortress 2 9/10 cuz of squeakers with mics and ocasional crashes  PARENTS READ   There are no cuss words in the game itself but the community does, People have mics and can cuss or use the chat system in game. But you can easily mute their mic or the chat. Look it up fi you want to know how. There is a LOT of gore and when I mean gore I mean body parts flying everywhere and blood splattering. There is no setting to censor this BUT there is this item called the Pyrovision Goggles. You can get this by buying them on the Mann Co- Store for like .99. Hope this helped! "
My wallet is crying.
I have currently spent $135.12 in a free to play game.  Still need more hats.
"I would say that this is the best free-to-play game out there.  There are so many items/cosmetics to customize your characters and you can color many of these to make them even more unique.Just by playing this game you get items. 10-11 items are dropped per week, depending how much you play of course.  On most free-to-play games you have to make an account which is a serious pain in the butt. First you need to log into steam then a second login to get into the game) thank god there is no second login on Team Fortress 2!"
"Clean, simple, and fun. Best of all it's free to play without nagging you to buy content."
Best hat simulator I have ever played.
"TF2 is far better than any other FPS I have ever played excluding 'Counter Strike' of course, with a unique and almost 'child friendly' vibe. With added 'hats' and 'different' weapons or 'different' takes on already existing weapons.   Gameplay is great and each of the 9 classes are completely unique with their own skills and weapons to master, Spy being the hardest and Heavy being the easiest (in my opinion), even though some may find the game repetitive and a '1 night fling' sort of game, it is still worth playing as it is a free to play.  The 'Online Policies' are not too bad but some items can cost and outrageous amount of money, but all can be avoided by buying items from tf2shop and trading with the online community at backpack.tf and etc.   But this game being 'Profitable' is not its only strong point, mastering and or becoming experienced at this game creates a much better play style and enjoyable game. Being competitive like most FPS (not COD -_-) learning the each classes strong point and weakness is fun and knowing which class can detect or kill another class easily is fun and interesting, for example if an engineer is not guarding his buildings they can be wiped out in seconds by Snipers or a by the Spy's sapper, if you consist as a team of all Heavies without 'Pocket Medics' you are not going to get very far if the neighbourhood Spy or Sniper comes along and says 'Hi!'.  Pyros mostly end up as Spy detectors if you are not an experienced player and help protect the Engineer and his ammo consuming buildings, and of course the Medic being one of the most quintessential points to a team’s success, if paired up with a Demoman or a Soldier and of course a Heavy.  Each class has three main ways to attack its 'prey', a primary weapon (the Heavy's minigun, Pyro's flamethrower, Engineer's sentry gun, etc.) and secondary (various classes have shotguns, others pistols, while the Demoman has a highly effective mine thrower) and melee weapons (the Scout's bat, the Medic's ‘bone saw’, and so on). Teamwork is also another vital part when it comes to winning against the 'enemy team'. As I find TF2 a great team builder along with 'Counter Strike'  Overall the game is a must play and especially coming from someone like me who has over 900 hours with the game: D  Opiziite - 9.6"
It's purty k
"Its a no-brainer, the most fun game in the century and best of all,free"

Ruined my life and developed a hat fetish. 10/10
My wallet has been bled dry.   10/10 IGN
Very interesting game. If you have hats you are rich i guess. Very fun though.
"Yes this is a very great game I'd say myself. I loved this game when I couldn't play or wasn't home I would watch so many S.F.Ms on my phone but not only Team Fortress 2 but also Half Life, Left 4 Dead, and so on. One day my computer broke so I missed the Halloween updates that I wanted to play on, but I could't. When I saw a video about the Halloween update gameplay I said, 'Man, I wish I was there'. But on Christmas I was very happy to see in my hand my computer. Fixed, I was so happy. I installed Steam A.S.A.P. When I played I was so happy to see all my classes, hats, cosmetics back to me, I even met up with old friends. I also noticed that The End of The Line update was out. I was pumped for it but it kinda sucked. Only a reskin of a wep, new hats (that I'm happy of), Taunt (Super cool), and more. When got the chance to get keys I opened crates only a few were dupes but I didnt really care that the fact there were cool. I aso met up with old friends we had so much fun together. Then one day I got a virus. I still played but addons kept comming ruining my gameplay. Then I decided to fix it. Nothing worked so I decided with the help of my brother to reset my computer ( Day before posting this). Then (Day of post 10 p.m) I saw my computer virus free. I was very happy then i saw a note it said 'Virus free have fun and your welcome'. I said thanks to my brother and redownloaded Steam, TF2, Garrys Mod, Counter Strike G.O,and so forth. Oh and one my thing... THANK YOU GABEN FORCREATING THIS FOR US ALL!!!(Sorry if i spelt it wrong)"
Awesome and addicting game. Also very funny and free!
I'm sorry for your parents if they have credit cards ;_;

This game is full of casuals and try hards. R8 it 8/8
Brilliant fun no pay to win just great
Played a match and some one was quacking like a duck the entire time. 10/10 would quack again
I've been playing this game since 2011 and this is the best ftp game ever!
JUST GET IT. You're taking it from the guy who made the game.  I have played Team Fortress 2 for a bit over 2 months and I continue to play whenever I have time :D
Nice game.
"TF2 will always be one of my favorites. I like participating in the market, because it is so simple to prosper. The violence is endless, but as you play, it does not seem violent.  Somehow, if you do not have this game, get it. Best free game that the world has to offer. TF2 makes its money from the overpriced Mann Co. store, which is why it is not $19.99 anymore.  I do not think this game needs a rating because it is free and worth so much more. It becomes addicting to stack hours on here."
"The best American First Person Shooter and Hat Wearing Simulator 2015. Congrats Valve, now could you count to three?"
"Its okay, I guess."
It's k
As far as i know this is the most wonderfull game . its fun . keep up the good work :D
A money waster  A GREAT money waster!
'This is a bucket'  'dear god' 'theirs more!' 'no....'  bread/10
such community  much keys  so wow
This game is probably one of the best free to play games on Steam and one of the best first person shooters.
great game!
"Hats, what more could you want? Theres also weapons.Everyones playing it you should too"
The best hat simulator! 10/10
expect to invest your college funds into this game....  9.999999/10 &lt;:
"I was going to wait until I hit 100 total hours of play time, but I just could not wait!  This game went Free To Play a while back, and with that decision, brought many players who were not serious about the game and just wanted a little game to play for a little while. I am not discouraging such behaviour, but Valve decided that they were no longer making money from game sales, so they added microtransactions. What a distasteful day. They added cosmetic items, such as hats, in the Sniper vs Spy update. It went to hell from there. Team Fortress 2 has become a game of trading hats and rarely weapons. Yes the game is still very fun. Yes the hats are kind of amusing. But I can not stree to you enough, there are few things worse than a kid flooding the chat menu with 'Deals' on his hats and cosmetics, while everyone else is playing the game.  One of the most entertaining features of this game is doing the conga! After a recent update, an item was released. An item to unify. An item to long live in players' hearts. This item is the conga! You can initiate the conga and have everyone on the server join in! You can conga for hours and just have fun, no violence!   Bottom line, this game is a shooter, nothing less, and a very balanced shooter at that. The classes are all very balanced and need each other to work together. This game is full of Free to Players who are here for the sole intention of trading, that is unfortunate, but the game is extremely fun.  Why are you even reading this?? This game is free! Spend 100's of hours FOR FREE!!!"
Play it now or die.
"I played a bit, seems good so far"
"Its a fun and active game, I love playing with friends and Ive had so many laughs on it! (♥o♥)"
its okay I guess
Best free to play game played so far
Most Epic Multiplayer game EVER! This is now my favorite game! Eeeeeeee! Graphics! Gameplay! Everything &lt;3
very competitive and very nice art stle and great gamplay
"There are a few types of people in this game 1. Gibus f2p's kids. 2. Pro's Disguised as f2p kids. 3. The ones full of cosmetics that don't know how to play. 4. The ones with no cosmetics that make you rage. 5. Rancho engineers, conga classes 6. Party crashers 7. Try Hard gibuses 8. Try hard rich people AND SO ON AND SO FORTH"
This game is super cool guys !
^_^
"♥♥♥♥ing brilliant, now back to the game"
"I like those hats.  Great game, doesn't become borning.Many different gamemodi, many cosmetics...  I can only recommend it."
"Obviously the best Free-To-Play game out there on steam. I've been playing this game for years and I still have not gotten tired of it, and I probably never will. It's not like any other game, COD, CS:GO, you name it, it's amazing how awesome it is. Just get it!"
Not even realistic 10/10 would waste my money on free2play again..
Haven't played much  10/10 would buy $200 hats again
11/10   -Best Hat Simulator of all time -Learned Fluent Russian in a week  -Economy can pay America's Debt -12yr olds give sex advice -Best bind spamming game ever -Can get banned for killing a friendly 
Put on a hat which crashed the game. 10/10 would crash again
Everything is great in this free to play game. Even paid games are not this much fun! 10/10 Would recommend to everyone I meet.
real life:because you know i'm all about that bass  tf2:because you know i'm all about that hat
spent my life savings on virtual hats
"Team Fortress 2 is a fast-paced game.From characters as fast as scout to characters as slow as heavy.Although some people might argue,I personally feel that scout is not the fastest. As a soldier,rocket jumping proves to be a good mean of reaching to the front line.A great item to have as a soldier when rocket jumping is the 'Gunboats'.The gunboats is a pair of AMAZING item.It provides lots of mobility.Next we're going to look at the classes. 1. Scout=Fast,good mean of damage with the scattergun,flying guillotine+sandman can take down a heavy fast 2.Soldier=Slow at moving,fast at rocket jumping,highest mean of damage with stock rocket launcher,gunboats for mobility and market gardener/escape plan 3.Pyro=Normal speed,reflecting rockets is the way to play pyro properly i feel and using the flare and axtinguisher gives you lots of damage output. 4.Demoman=Slower by normal speed by a bit,Pipes and stickybomb launcher is a really good mean of taking down sentry nests.You can have lots of fun by being a troll demoman by having the boots,tide turner or sticky jumper(depending of map) and the ullapool caber.The fun factor is high. 5.Heavy=Slowest class,Good mean of damage and very effective at attacking sentries. 6.Engineer=Normal speed,widowmaker teaches you how to aim your shotgun as missing takes out your ammo,pistol for secondary as its your seond long range weapon.Gunslinger as its annoying and fun to use. 7. Medic=Faster than normal by a bit,blutsauger,kritzkrieg for the healing taunt and uber saw to build uber for team. 8.Sniper=Normal speed,challenging but fun,sniper is an effective class to deal with heavies. 9.Spy=Normal speed.Last but not least,we have the SPY.An effective class against sentry nests,heavies and medics,the spy is a very sly class,able to take out sentry nests with the sapper,taking out heavy and medic combos is a huge up side.   Overall tf2 is a fun game to play ."
In real life: hat + fire ≠ money In the game: hat + fire = billionare  
its fun thats all  you can get swag buy buying cosmetic or waiting for the rare chance of you finding one look at all the pllayer with australium or unusual swag  thats all i can say
"Amazing, never gets boring as your constantly getting new items. "
It's very good game.
11/10. would play for more 100 hours
It's a game.
it's so fun
"What is There to say about tf2?... pickles...   Play The game and get addicted, then go shove all your money into."
"You gota download TF2 its an awesome game plus its free.there are awesome 9 playable caratchers each clas has a specail set.there is SCOT,SOILDIER,PIRYO,DEMOMAN,HEAVY,ENGINEER,MEDIC,SNIPER,SPY.The scou has a shotgun,a pistol and a bat.The soildier has a rocket launcher,a shotgun and a shovel.The piryo has a flameflower,a shotgun and a fire axe.The demoman has a grenade lanchur,a sticky bomb launcher and a botlle.The heavy has a minigun,a shotgun and fist.The engineer has a shotgun,a pistol,a wrench he can also build sentry's,dispencer and teleporter.The medic has a medigun that heals player,a sayring gun I probaly didnt spell that corectly and a bone saw.And the spy has a knife that can backstab people (its an instal kill)a revolver,a saper that is uset to sap engineer buildings and he could disguse as the enemy team. I like TF2 verry much you can get difrent weapons and you can customized you're clash.there are also difrent events in TF2 like christmas you get a stock sock and inside is 8 items.there is also haloween.ITS FREE"

09/10
Was fun. Only played a little though
i love this game becouse so many hats and soooooo many friendly players sooooooo many game modes and sooooooo many weapons
"I loved this game. Loved. This game has sadly long since surpassed its glory days, and it shows in not only the community, but also in the content which the game has to offer. TF2 is a live-action FPS game that pits two teams -- red and blu -- against each other in a multitude of different settings and cuircumstances. Its 'cartoony' look and simple controls make this game shine. However, the good ends there.  The community is composed of three main groups: the meta-gamers, the tryhard/noobs, and the pros.   The Meta-Gamers are the ones who don't mess around and actually attempt to complete the objective. They are the backbone of TF2. These players aren't the ones who make this game... bad.  The Tryhards and/or Noobs are basically the ones who are so insecure about themselves that they kill everything and everyone that they see. Is there a Sniper on the 'Sniper Ledge'? Let's play Scout and camp the roof! ... Stupid freakin' Double Cross... Oh well, at least they'll die a lot because they never stay away from a battle... no... sorry bro. You're dead again, and again, and again, DC.   Finally there's the pros. These guys used to be the best of the best. Still are, but the pros are usually so tired of this... less than amusing game, that they don't even play TF2. They Conga, they Relaxo Taunt, they rocket jump EVERYWHERE. Sometimes, he'll be a YouTuber, and then he'll actually play; and he owns the entire opposing team. I mean, the guys probably mastered rocket jumping, and has so many Stranges and Unusuals that he could supply the Mann Co. Store itself for a week.  The absolute, biggest problem with this game, however, is not the newbs, the campers, or even that annoying Map glitch -- pick one they're everywhere -- it's the Developers. Valve has milked this game for YEARS. TF2 was released over 7 years ago. SEVEN!! This game is so unimportant to Valve, it just updates because we beg for it. Every update, Valve gives us a few buggy, untested maps, several new weapons that suck balls -- I'm looking at you, Iron Bomber... -- , and maybe even a new gamemode. Yay... now we can RACE Payloads... Thanks buddy...   DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE GRAPPLING HOOK !!!  Look guys, the game is great. Just not for the ones that have been here for so long. There are great communities out there, they're just rare. If you DO decide to get this game, good luck, and... here's some tips: Don't use Valve servers, don't overuse Pyro, and use a Trading Guide for God's sake!"
Best of f2p steam game
"When you first played it you may get bored because it is hard to get items, unless you could pay for it. But trust me it felt really good when you got an items, and when you killed people that better than you."
"If you are looking for a AWESOME game that may just become your favorite game, you are looking in the right place. TF2 has an amazing community with endless fun! TF2 has countless modes and maps to play with a ton of weapons to choose from to fit your play style. Also, with 9 different classes to choose from, each with different rolls, the possibilities are endless. So what are you waiting for, get it now!"
Great game but for the love of god some people need to get a life in this game.  Seriously I could buy a real sombrero for less than 10 dollars.  ay dios mio :0
I'm extremely sure that this game is the reason I don't have a car now.  or a girlfriend  or a job  or social skills   This game simply ruined my life.  10/10 would recommend to friends and family
Kill a squeaker. Get cussed out for doing so.  10/10 would dominate again
Killed someone with a fish 10/10
"Kids,Kids everywhere."
Amazing game with 9 awesome classes to play as. Definitely reccomend
Send help. Now.
"Ok, so I'm an old guy. We used to have to play this stuff for real in the playground of our local school. Man, you don't know problems 'til you've got a bunch of little kids screaming and running from your makeshift flamethrowers and grenade launchers…. Anyway, years later, we played Unreal Tournament, which was hella fun and didn't get the police or FBI involved. It looks primitive now like a Ford Pinto looks primitive (or would, if you ever saw one, which you don't). After all this time, I found myself really missing the bloody gibfest of psychopathic entertainment. So I picked up TF2.  KILL ME WITH SUPERIOR FIREPOWER. That's all I can say. I get slap-happy and stoopid with adrenaline playing this fragfest of a killing game. I am giddy among the rain of giblets. Screaming bloody hoo-ha as I &lt;crit&gt; shot someone's head. It's almost obscene, the amount of fun I have. And you can have the same kind of fun! Just download the game now and join in! You'll be fragging jokers all day! You'll forget food. You'll forget showers. You'll forget to use the toilet. You will become a single-focus zombie mad murdering death machine, and you'll like it. Rrrraaaawwwwrrrr!!!!1!  Then, when it's all over, you will appreciate wee little kittens and otters and whatnot, docile as a flower.  Until next time."
"A giant multiplayer game with tons of things to do and dicover. This is not like your ordinaery shooter, no, this is TEAM fortress 2. Work together closely with other classes and find a balance in your team to what is possible and what isn't. Pyro's best tactic isn't walking forward while firing, rather airblast the enemy and use your shotgun. Gets them every time. Soldiers rocket can do splash damage so they hit more while hitting the ground. The community is also rather fun to play with, since there are plenty of nice people. Recommended for anyone age 12+"
I killed a guy with my taunt. 11/5
"Pretty good, never played it   10/10"
I highly recommend this game for those who likes fps first-person shooters.Amazing concept and there's alot to discover.
Fun And Easy To Play (Getting My Badges :p)
"Has a flaming hat? Seems legit. Has a flaming hat worth $10,000? Seems more legit"
all good but i cant send u bugs to be fixed by pressing F7
This game is great! It's a nice game for casual gamers like me :P
"AMAZING GAME almost 1000 hours already, its pretty much a hat simulator with 9 models and a lot of guns lol, 10/10 recommend :DD"
"Finally, Valve are coming back and sorting this game out, more patches, more fair play, pretty much a brand new, polished, fun experience."
"This is the sexiest, awesomest, hat-filled free-to-play there is!! Good on you, Valve!"
My hours say it all   In honor of this new update 10/10 ducks 
"This War-based Hat and gamble simulator is filled with more cosmetic Items then actual weapons, Memes from all generations and 12 year olds that just came back from school to see how loud they can scream into a 5$ microphone.  Its also really addicting.  I havent seen the sunlight for over 1,000 hours, so if you are reading this please send help."
I dont like this game I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE THIS GAME
A really good game for poor people.
'Ok got all this refined to buy some new weapo- I WANT THAT HAT TAKE ALL MY REFINED!!!'
Ruined my life 10/10
"Very fun game, can lose a lot of time and money though. Well at least I have my Gibus."
"Review: If you like a cartoony animated FPS, then this is your dream game. It has good gameplay and the classes have their own strengths and weaknesses which makes gameplay very unique. Also the classes are made to work together to win a match.  My Most Favorite Part of Team Fortress 2: The Halloween event is my favorite part of TF2, It's all crazy and very funny when you play on the Halloween Event maps. But the downside is that you can only play the Halloween Event around the time of Halloween. I also like the unique classes  What I Don't Like About Team Fortress 2: I think the prices on many items in the shop are outrageous. They should also have more weapons instead of many more cosmetics. Also, there needs to be a more secured VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) system because I have been in games where the hacker doesn't take any damage, I have played with at least 36 hackers in my entire time playing this game. Also, ever since the 'TF:GO' update came out, this game has gone in a downhill spiral, and with the Matchmaking update released, I've stopped playing on Valve servers and instead play on fun community servers.  Rating: 8.0 / 10  Really Good"
you go into to play for an hour and wooooop youve spent 14 hours
"TF2 everbody! it is good for some but not all, I am not here to tell u to play it but u should try it *( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)*"
Mmm good and perfect for some multiplayer and mann ups etc and training more :)
"Takes your soul, and shoves it in a hat"
"This game will... Steal your life... Take your girlfriend... Make you homeless... Ruin your relationship with your family... But at the end, you will always play this game."
The best 1000 hours spent :3
"'I love you'  -Spookwagon, 2014"
"This game is free, but you'll probably spend more money on it than you would on any other game.  Best free game that you'll spend unnecessarily high amount of money on ever ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Also an Accidentally-Kill-Yourself / Allahu Akbar Simulator."
"Honestly, i love the game, and it has a good community once you become a p2p, i was a f2p for about 150 - 200 in game hours, and people were just major douches to me."
I play for the hats.
"I have played Team Fortress 2 for about 4 years now,basicly it is the best game ever for me i really like playing it i met allot of friends on TF2 [Team Fotress 2] and i hope the people who read this think the same this game is actually to be just heaven.The sad thing i dont really like is the fact of the TF2 store it is kinda expencive most hats already kost about 4 dollars/euro's but thats basicly the bad thing about TF2 nothing more its just a simple F2P/P2P wargame and i would deffinatly recommand people to play this"
"This game is amazing, once you start playing this, it will get more fun the more you play. I used to be a new player when I started this game I didn't much much, didn't know how to play, or even what to do. after while its more fun, got hats, strange's, weapons, killstreak's, and other sorts of amazing items!  Here are some of my reasons people should download it and why I love it.  - Hats  - Killstreak weapons  - Unusual hats  - Amazing weapons  - Trading  - Get all your teammates to be your class like heavies and have an army of heavies  - Custom servers  - Critsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss  - Guns, lots... lots of guns (Sentry Gun)  - Amazing classes to choose  - Sandvich   I recommand for new players who are about to download this game should get it. For the new players who are reading this, get the game, download it and enjoy it as much as you want like its freakin free to play! ITS AWESOME! But don't go into the game to much or else your just gonna be a guy/girl who just spend $1000 on hats, weapons and other sorts so its best you think about how much your spending. But hope I'm hoping you guys are going to enjoy this game a lot, trust me people you will love it. :)"
"This game has great simplicity, just push a bomb cart to a deploy point, capture the flag, capture all 3 points, keep a point for 3 minutes, or race the bomb cart while having to defend and offend. There's 9 classes, a fast Boston runner, a rocket launcher soldier, a flaming arsonist, demolitions expert, heavy-weapons specialist, engineer, medic, sniper and hidden spy. All of these classes make equal gameplay. The updates are free. Also, it has a trading community, just if you wanna gain a few bucks. If you're bored, the TF2 community made different gamemodes such as Jailbreak, Death Run, Vs Saxton Hale (sort of like a boss battle fight) and more! Sometimes there's glitches or something weird that makes me always wanna come back. I'd rate this 10/10, this is my #1 game. By the way, if you play this game, the soldier would be the best class to start off with. Make sure to finish the training!"
"Duck, Bread, Bumper Cart, Alien, Train, Gun Viewing, and Hat Simulator have crashed...     11/10         look at my hours please god ♥♥♥♥ing help me"
"This game has a high amount of salty nubskrubs, it's funny."
This Game Is Freaking Amazing One of the best free to plays....ever
Best game ever!~ Really fun and a very big stress relaver if you want to bust some heads open from really rough days.
THIS IS THE BEST
I had something called 'Life' but then I found this game.
"Fun addictive, great gameplay and just downright cool game. though i must say i wish it was easier to find weapons and other cosmetic items but once you become a premium member im sure thats no longer an issue. I personally hope that they add a new character to the game something like the engineer where he can place down support, but without the permanant effect but the trade off is his is stronger in some way."
You can conga and give GabeN your money... 420/10
"Best game i have ever played, Absolutely love it! "
"DO YOU LIKE HATS? DO YOU LIKE HATS? DO YOU HATE HATS? DO YOU HATE HATS? IF YOU SAID YES TO ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS, TF2 IS RIGHT FOR YOU! WITH PLENTY OF HATS, YOU GET TOP BRAGGING RIGHTS AGAINST THE F2p PLOX'S THAT YOU WILL RUN INTO.  IGNORE THE MEDIC THAT IS HEALING SPIES AS THEY TRY TO BACKSTAB EVIL PYROS THAT BLOW YOU FROM THE WATER FROM GETTING RID OF THE FIRE ThAT THEY DID TO YOU. FIGHT THeM WITH YOUR LUSCIOUS HATS AND SPEND 200 DOLLARS ON KEYS AND GET ONLY AN UNUSUAL WORTH 25$. NOW, YOU MUST FIGHT WITH THE UNUSUAL BY YOUR SIDE AND FIGHT FOR FREEDOM, FROM THE GAME GABEN CREATED CALLED TEAM FORTRESS 2.   GOoD MORNING AND IF I DONT SEE YOU IN-GAME, GOOD AFTERNOON AND GOOD NIGHT!  -Posh"
Great Game

3 words i love 10/10
"[Someone Please Read This, I Worked Very Hard On It And Neglected My Algebra Homework]  First, it was Soldier. Still my highest played class today, I was determined back then to learn how to rocket jump. I felt so accomplished when I learned how, but I needed something new. I left taking something from it, to remind me of how much time and effort I had put into learning- a Strange Killstreak Rocket Launcher.  So I moved on to other things, never sticking with one class too long, trying to soak up as much skill as I could by playing all 9 classes randomly, whenever I felt like it. I got my loadouts figured out, I stayed away from getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by never playing Engie, I got close to my enemies with Scout so I could meatshot them.   I stopped using the Grenade Launchers with Demo and started making sticky traps and sticky jumped everywhere. I learned (sort of) how to correctly use my M2 and non-flamethrower weapons with Pyro. I rarely played Heavy, and if I ever was, I had my sandwich out and was spamming X+5. I wanted to learn how to fully play all of these incredible, and surprisingly overall balanced characters.  Not medic though. Medic was lame, you couldn't kill anything. I couldn't 420 noscope like all of the dank Mtn-Dew-Chugging, Dorito-Inhaling MLG snipers, so I just Lucksman'd. I earned my Pan early on... it's still my favorite melee weapon after all of this time.  And then skill didn't matter. Why should I even have gone out of spawn and tried if all I was ever going to be called was a hatless F2P? I needed cosmetics. I needed to kill people while wearing classy virtual headgear.  So I dove even further into this game, scrapping nearly my entire backpack, becoming an itemless nomad to search for cool things to put on my head, venturing to community and trade servers. Along the way, I began to leave behind my murderous rampages, going instead to a life of peace and taunts, and airblasting people around who were on the other team.  And then... wait... if I played Medic, doesn't that mean I don't have to hurt people, that I can help my teammates instead? I rushed back to my pub homelands, eager to begin preserving the lives of my fellow teammates. Rushing in to cap the final point, learning how to near seamlessly share uber amongst several patients, was exhilarating. I topped it all off with a Carbonado Botkiller Medigun Mk. 1 off of the store. It was shiny. It was glorious. Oh, and Archimedes and the Gentleman's Ushanka.  I still couldn't aim at all with Sniper. Lucksman it is again.  And then, the 9th class. Something I understood I could never learn how to play, no matter how stealthy I thought I was, how well I thought I could act out that Engie disguise, there would be a convenient Pyro shooting flames in that one spot I was walking through. But I wanted to learn how to play Spy! The adrenaline of killing an entire team, in a perfect line, so focused on the chokepoint... It was too good of a reward for me to pass up, no matter how much I had to practice. So practice I did.  And I got better. 1 Backstab. Death. 2! Death. 4, 6, another kill, and another one! I stayed up literally all night on tr_walkway, repetitively finding the angles of backstab which I could safely attack. And I'm still practicing, trying to do stairstabs, failing terribly. Oh well. If I was going to spend so much time on this, I might as well have gotten a Botkiller Knife from the market.  I was back into the mood of killing everything on the screen, but not just players. I needed waves, waves upon waves. So I fired up MvM, and got in a Skype Call with a Steam Friend. It was there I learned that MvM takes more strategy and teamwork than I had ever really used in pub games, so I went back to playing Medic, and it was more than enough with the Projectile Shield and Uber Lightning-Fast. I'm now on my third out of four missions for the Op Two Cities Tour, and I'm planning to go back over and over until I get an Australium weapon.  What's next after that? The skybox's the limit in this game.  Who knows, maybe I'll learn how to play Sniper. XD  -Thanks For Reading"
"This game is based around 9 classes fighting against another team of other classes. In other words a team based game. When ever you start playing you choose between a red or blue team and get to choose the class you want to play as. The classes are Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demo Man, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy. I reccomend if you are just starting to play this game, do not start with playing spy. He is the hardest class to master. There are also a variety of game modes. King Of The Hill, Capture the Flag, and Payload are just a few of them. Here is a list of the pros and cons.  Pros:  - Free to Play  - Variety of Classes  - Variety of Game Modes  - Hats  - Lots of Weapons for Each Class  - Constantly Updated  - A Lot of Humor  Cons:  - Some Bugs and Glitches Here and There  Hope this recommendation helped. I encourage you to play this game. Thank You.   'SCREAMIN' EAGLES' say Soldier"
"A game that has been around for years. It has been a good game for quite awhile now. But then came the F2Ps Conga Ducks  Personally, this game is good but it just went a little too far in everything.  "
I swear this is better than Call Of Duty.
"Considering I'm a guy who plays pub mostly in community server, Meet your Match was nothing but improvements for me. The only update that gets me to play in Valve servers.  Of course, cant say the same to others, but in my personal opinion, MyM was a great update. There's close to no downside for me. Casual is fun, and it's not even that different from how Valve servers used to be anyway. It's not like you cannot be friendlies nor being a tryhard. The only thing missing is autobalance and switching team, which is somewhat reasonable to not have since it's more focused on your team now.  Still, I dont get why those who miss old valve servers not just go find some vanilla community servers. There's a lot of those, yknow. The only different there is probably only some 'title' in their name in chat or a tiny watermark of their server name on the corner of the screen anyways"
i realy realy love this game thx Gaben
this great game just keeps getting better
best game of my life i love it but i think it still needs to be fixed but good job valve :)

Cool Geams
Team Fortress 2 PAH more like bean fortress 2. I mean it's fun to play but... they just never shut up about beans man it's all beans this beans that. The Engineer class even makes a machine that dispenses beans. Just like wtf you like beans I get it just back the ♥♥♥♥ off
This game is sadder than to the moon.  Open 100 crates and you'll see why.
this game is the best game ive ever played well it was made by vale so of cores it.
"Amazing gameplay! You should all play this game! It doesn't have really extreme graphics like CS:GO but at the end of the day once you finished playing it, GRAPHICS DON'T MATTER IN THIS GAME! There's even Mann VS Machine and bosses that most likely isn't in other FirstPersonShooter games, you could even use a Console Command [If you dare too] to edit the terrain around yer'self! Well, obviously other players don't notice that, this Team Fortress 2 is highly recommended other then that...Team Fortress Classic....Anyway! You should all use your FreeHours to play this Amazing Multiplayer FirstPerson Shooter game! WOOOOOOOOoooooooo! X3"
This game suckled on my wallet like a new born on it's mothers breast.
"Team Fortress 2 is, in my opinion, one of the best games ever, if not THE best game ever created. I have been playing it for almost a year now, and I am still not getting tired of it. The diversity and potential of this game are huge, and it is so much fun to just hang around in pubs, not to forget the competitive scene which I unfortunately have not tried out yet. I would recommend this game to anyone who is thinking about trying it out, and to anyone who has not even heard of this game. Team Fortress 2 is a fantastic game, go ahead and jump right in!"
"haven't played it much yet, but I kinda like it"
"Team Fortress 2 is a really fun game, to play when you want to kill some time ecc... But there's one thing. Why? Why Valve? Why Pyros?  Seriusly, they are the most ANNOYING class. Everyone could use it and be the first of the server. Sure, it seems fun to play, and it is, but it's really annoying to other players. Even teammates. So it would be really fun to downgrade the Pyro class. It deals too much damage in 5 seconds. It has no white spots, the flametrower deals damage from too far. And that's it. No love for Pyros. And they don't deserve it."
Sandwiches and guns. Nothing could get better.
It's free.
 Team Fortress 2
Simple yet brilliant. 9 well thought and balanced character classes that all have personalities that stand out
It's a fun game. That's all.
This game reminds me of my bathtub in my opra house.
"I really like TF2, it is suitable for most ages for the characters are very animated and silly looking, but the reason I said MOST ages is becaue of the diabolical blood &gt;:D"
Do i even need to bother you know the answer
Uneven Teams Simulator 2015
"This is the one of the best,intense,funny,addictiive fps multiplayer game i've ever played."
unoriginaljokehatsemptywallet simulator/10 would drink bleach again
is rly gud
why did I waste so much time on this
Best point and click adventure game i have seen.
"Why haven't I written a review for this yet? Onwards to the only game in history where your friends might be your enemies, people yell at a failed doctor German man to help them though they never help him, a large russian man throws sandwiches and lunch meats at you to heal your wounds, a sneaky croissant screws his watch up to turn him invisible and forgets he has a son in the process, a boston boy breaks his own legs jumping too many times and hunts down said sneaky baguette for loving his mother, a confused American finds a Rocket Launcher and goes mad, fire thing, a Texan with a PhD builds machines to heal and hurt everything, an angry australian man urinates into bottles and throws them at his enemies before opening fire, and an intoxicated African-American-Scottish cyclops manages to get a hold of a grenade launcher. And hats.  100/100"
&gt;Are you Rich? (in Real Life) &gt;Are you skilled? &gt;Do you want to have Golden Weapons?  Then this game is for you!
I never knew that you could turn people into gold with your frying pan
This game ruined my life.
"My experience is fairly limited, I don't play many games, but I do think TF2 is fun, and with the right group of people, its hilarious!"
Wasted $10 on a taunt that makes you conga   11/10 Would conga again
Very excellent game! I recommend to all players!
If you enjoy blowing people up setting them on fire or beating them to a pulp then this the game for you!
tf2 is a great game but still has some bugs and sometimes runs slow. one of my favourite games
YATATATATATATATA YATATATATATA KAABOOM KAABOOM  all of u r ded   10/10 Would Heavy again.
"DEAR GOD THIS GAME IS FUN  i recommend this game to anyone who wants to have game strategy,(MvM part), skill, and best of all, SUPER ULTIMATE CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION!!!!!! plus, guns and guts and blood. so much blood and explosions and sounds to make your eardrums fall out"
its awesome game 
he has no style he has no grace this spy has a funny face he can backstab when he needs to and stretch his cloak out just for you transform himself just like a small crab this crazy class just thinks hes fab oh yeah
"MANN VS MACHINE FOR EVER!   Shift+Tab is my nightmare,game becomes so annoying (blackscreen) when you press these two and you have to restart the game again :)."
You bring a fish into a gunfight and win  10/10
ahhhh tf2 this game brought me so much memories sooo MANY almost as much as my childhood my point is if you are gouing to quit tf2 you have to think this over first are you gouing to delete kill burn all of your memories your first unusual your first weapon your first strange killstreak etc. and give it all up for some gay game you may not like thats all i have to say i thank you
i crafted 54 guns into 27 scrap metals  i crafted 27 scrap metals into 9 reclaimed metals  i crafted 9 reclaimed metals into 3 refined metals  i crafted 3 refined metals into hair  i made hair out of 54 guns
"Indeed, a very good and repudible game. I highly recomend. Many gamemodes, thousands of servers, and endless fun."
"I love this game, From the hilarious things the classes say when they kill an enemy, to the funny Meet The Team videos like meet the pyro. Even though i am too young for this game as i am 10 the game still makes 100% sense too me!"
this is awesome free to play game even though im not a F2P anymore :D keep up the good work valve
great amazing outstanding game.
This game is 1000/10  Hat Fortress 2 For the wins!! One of the best games i ever played!
"Before this game, I didn't pay attention to hats. Now I can't look at hats without judging and adoring them, they are amazing. Living without hats is like living without a toilet when you have diarrhea, it sucks horribly."
GREAT GAME!   If tf2 was not like it was today i dought that peoiple would play it. Its a fun but serious game at the same time
"This game is REALLy funny!  Please get it  IT'S ALSO FREE  And sometimes annoying   This Meet your Match update is the worst update in history and they should change it back!! Well done, Valve, people are quitting your once brilliant because of the unfarmiliar HUD and menu. You removed 3 votes. The rounds are too short; What if I meet a cool person who's really nice but OH WAIT THE MATCH HAS ENDED. Bring back your servers, and the chance of joining a MVM was 100% to 10%, long ♥♥♥ waiting times, this is your attempt to make a great game like another great game, CS:GO, but why the hell shall I play a free game which is much shorter and similar to this other one, TF2 is no longer unique, leave it, Valve, go back to new maps, bug fixes, new weapons, nerfs and buffs, we all loved that. I don't want to wait 2 whole minutes constantly clicking on the Badge, compared to the good old NON WAITING TIMES, just click on the map and you're on- no wait, that was before the update.  So many people agree with me, even a Youtuber like Muselk hates it, So get off your butts Valve and make it go back  About 80% of people hate the update and may quit altogether You had a casual game (TF2) and a competitive game (CS:GO) and that was great but now you had to make them both competitive and what's the point of 2?  JUST DO IT!"
awsome game
It's 10% fun 20% skill 15% concentrated power of will 5% wallet 50%trade And a hundred percent reason to play this AWEsome Game!!!
"Awsome Game, Recomend ;)"
So uh.. got my LOOTCRATE today. and guess what I WAS HAPPY AS I DONT KNOW WHAT! ive been with you guys awhile for xbox and then moved to pc but.. you know you guys are fantastic just utterly awesome. i love my sandvich button &lt;3 keep on making crate stuff ;)
"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, where to start with this game. This game is one of the best F2P FPS games out there and, frankly, one of the best games of all time.  Pros: Can get every weapon withought having to pay. Awesome core gameplay. Nice medium-high pace  Cons:  If you are new, well.... get ready to get rekt. Also it's a bit addicting."
I played for a few minutes... it was kinda fun
"Wow. My hours. All my hours. Gone. For good reason. Much recommend, many good, wow."
How to win TF2:   1) Buy Conga taunt. 2) Enter servers and do Conga every possible time. 3) Infect all servers with Conga.  End result:  Something slightly more entertaining than a Hat Simulator without paying any real money.
I never really played this game. It was okay though.
Team Fortress 2 is a great game and I'm pretty sure anyone would like it (except CoD squeakers)
this game is the best game ever created
"Spent $300 on hats , hung my self with shoelaces from Scout cosmetic.  Fell from ceiling saved by ego and unusual effects  Gaben rises from the teleporter and lightly whispers in my ear... The TF2 family would always look out for you...  I breath in heavily as the Medic watches over me , with a sudden sadness in his eyes.  Gaben proceeds to let down his pants do reveal what i saw was a negative percentage. I scream into the night to the howl of wolves and miniguns.  I wake the next day , The day holding happiness and prospect.  Then I realised this was a waste of my time.  Thanks for listening."
"Great game, free to play and trading :D"
"An excellent game, would recommend it to other friends for sure!"
I just came here for the hats who cares about the game Its all about the HATS HATS HATS HATS
Dress up Simulator 2007. Free-to-Play breeding ground. Extreme inflation in economy. Hours of my life spent on it.   Perfect Game 10/10
"id say its pretty ok, and pretty easy to accidentally leave on  personally i like the demoman and i think hes a pretty alright dude"
"thanks gaben for this balanced game, which was totally worth the wait"
What do i have to say... its tf2 :)
"Good multiplayer game, just play with your friends."
I could have sworn I had money in my wallet before I played this game...
"Best game, teaches you vodka words and pootis real quick. If you like to hear angry 10 year olds keep people unmuted and u will find what u wish for. If you like to play the game for what it is, mute everyone. If you like to get stabbed, play heavy. If you like to get burned, play spy. If you like to fly, play soldier or demoman. If you like to stay bad at the game, play medic. If you like to be sanic, there's scout. If you like to be safe while killing, play sniper.(360 noscopes are not a thing in this game... or is it?:) ) If you like to be the guy everyone hates, play pyro. If you like to be (rancho)relaxo, play engineer.  This game has something for everyone, it's free. stop reading start playing the game."
"You don't understand, for years people have been telling me 'YOU'RE NO GOOD!' NOW I'M GOOD! I have a hat to prove it!"
"This game is awesome. Hats, Gatling guns, sniper rifle, jars of ♥♥♥♥, FISH, katanas, rocket launcher, flare guns. Alot of crazy and fun weapons. AND HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATS!!!!!!!!!!!"
just awesome... nothing more. my favorite game since a long time. 
"This game took my life, and if you play this game too, it will take your life. Good luck."
"I could not be more dissapointed in a game developer than Valve. Why would you remove the one thing that brings the people to a game in the first place?  Don't get me wrong, I love TF2, I really do. But the fact that a game developer as 'good' as Valve would do something so ♥♥♥♥ing stupid just gets me ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.   Incase you, The Reader don't know what I'm talking about, I'm talking about the removal of Pubs and the release of Casual.   Casual is at the time of writing this review the only 19 hours old update of Team Fortress 2. You might recognize the name of this gamemode from the game Counter-Strike Global Offensive. Those games are both from Valve so one can assume that they have the same principe. Just like the weapons skins for example.  They do, but the one of TF2 is way more satanic.  Here is a small example:   'I feel like playing a quick little game of Upward!' You're now on your way to: CP Junction 'Wow that is exactly... what I didn't want. I'm not playing this.' Are you sure you want to leave the game? Abandoning will result in a matchmaking cooldown and you will be unable to play for: 1 week. 'Wait, you're kidding, right? Seriously? Fine. I'll take the hit and look for a community server instead.' You have abandoned a game. You will be unable to play ranked or casual games for: 1 week. 'Yeah, yeah, I know. Let's try the server browser.'  Here is an example of the new system. Sounds just like Competitive, am I right? People who play Casual, Mann vs. Machine or Competitive and abandon mid-match will be granted with a matchmaking cooldown. Since they are the only gamemodes availible at the moment, you, The Player, have no control over what you are going to play. 'If you don't want to play cp_junction, you can just wait a week to try again m8' ~Valve  This is not where the horror ends. The abnormally long waiting times to find a game are also a thing to look out for. Sure, this update is only 19 hours old and the players might be pumped to play the game after the update so the servers might be slow for some time.  I know Valve, and I know that this is not the case. If this will keep going I can guarantee that the servers will stay slow and the waiting times will stay high.   Why would Valve actually listen to their customers and make the game like they want it to be? It is just like the Escrow update. No one asked for it, No one wanted it, period.  Why would you make a game as cartoony as TF2, make a serious piece of ♥♥♥♥ game nobody wants? Why? Why? Why?  So, to end this review, I'm asking Valve to get things together and to actually ♥♥♥♥ing listen to the players in their games. This also goes for Dota 2, CS:GO, etc. You will seriously kill games if you guys continue like this. Please."
Its the most played free to play game besides DoTa on steam and its made by valve! What could go wrong?
"Best online fps game on pc, the most fun you can get for a f2p game."
fun to play with friends..:)
"Fantastic online fun, although much better with friends who aren't on the opposite team. Lots of different game styles, whether official or community made, all nine classes are fairly well balanced if your team is too. 8/10 would recommend even if you don't play many shooter games"
"Great game, but I've forced myself to quit. Got to the point where it was unhealthy for me to play. Same thing happened with SMITE.  The only reason I'll be playing this game now is for deathrun, the odd bit of pubbing and some prophunt.  Thank you for all the good times GabeN"
its ♥♥♥♥ 10/10
10/10 would eat your money for hats and keys
"Team Fortress 2 is a great game. At its core, 'TF2' is a Team-Based, First Person Shooter. Just outside the core, TF2 is a crazy mosh pit of rockets, fire, hats, and death. TF2 has 9 varied classes that are all very unique and very viable in gameplay. It can serve as a main game for people who love FPSs, or a fun little side game to play every now and then for people who need to blow off some Steam by blowing away some noobs."
wouldn't give this awful game more than 2 hours
Really Fun game
i wod hawe choose TF2 insted of my home :D Super mega epic fun super fantastik ultra cool 1000000000/10 
"My name is Gaben yo. Team Fortress 2 is free to play. Yet to play Team Fortress Classic you have to pay.  But anyways, this game is gr8, I swear it ain't b8, m8. 88/8 get it, it's your f8."
"Enjoyed this game, really childish but fun at the same time :P"
"Okay, so, if you ever want a First-Person Shooter Game, this is for you. Because... it has HATS. Yes, HATS. The most desired thing you ever want. And crates. Who doesn't love crates? I have no idea. You should play this game. It's fun. Go download it. It's free. Do it. Do it now. DO IT NOW"
Best game I have ever played...And the fact that it is a F2P game makes it even better. 10/10! Want to hear the best thing about this game? Hats. I mean everyone likes hats right?
THIS IS A GOOD GAME CUZ U SHOOT STUFF AND UBERCHARGE AND BE INVINCEBLE THEN SHOOT MORE STUFF AND YOU SET PEOPLE ON FIRE AND HAVE A ROCKET LAUNCHER AND ROCKET JUMP AND BLOW STUFF UP AND U STICK STICKY BOMBS YOU OPEN CRATES AND GET GUNS U MAKE BIG AUTO MACHINE GUNS AND ...Yeah thats it realy.
Best game ive laid my hands on
Tf2 is a fun game and if you a Cod fanboy idk if you will like it but the game is one of the best ever
i was very sceptic about pc-games once not anymore
"This game is the perfect game if you're into 1st-person-shooters and what not, but this game is great for many gamers around the world!"
A great hat game with a nice shooting mini-game!
"Incredibly addictive and highly entertaining, I see TF2 pop up constantly on Youtube because it is so popular. I highly recommend this game."
A great game!
Great game! Lots of killing and the only game that doesn't come with hats! COD was too much like a hat simulator.
idk. My hat is spooky.
"I guess it's alright, nothing special"
This game is simply fun like really fun from the classes who have their own unique personalities making them come to life while experience the game each with their own playstyle that is both enjoyable and a blast to learn and play   the cosmetics only sweeten the deal making everyone look and feel different and not bland like most shooters out there  overall if you enjoy a good time and like free things with a lot of content this game is for you I hope this helped and I really Hope you enjoy this game   Also it has hats.....who doesn't like hats?
This game is really fun and thrilling. It has many weapon choices and trading can be fun too. I would recommend this game.
"This is a great game with charismatic class choices and an overall unique animation design: I could recognize anything from Team Fortress 2 most anywhere on the internet. I'll be perfectly honest and hope there isn't a storm of fecal matter inbound: I started playing after it became free to play. As in, it took me several months after the 'freelease' (as I put it) to get legitimately interested in the game, enough to actually want to give it a spin.   It was fairly easy enough to navigate for a newcomer, and I rather highly suggest running through the class tutorials before going out and playing with others. Single player with the bots is also what I did for a small while prior to working up the nerve to join in on a server.   Like just about everything, the community has some rotten apples and 'squeakers,' and the few glitches I've encountered are minor, easily fixed without a restart, and somewhat amusing so long as it doesn't cause me to lag. I became very competitive very quickly.  My complaint for the sake of this review would be how bloated the game is and how long it took to download it for the first time on a new computer. However, the lore is decent and the gameplay is, for the most part, worth the wait."
PLAY THIS GAME PLAY IT OR ILL ♥♥♥♥ YOU!!!!!!!!!!
Goat Simulator 2014 is so this year. Hat Simulator 2014? Now that's what I'M talking about!
this game is for you if you have alot of money to spend on hats and keys. 11/10
"Fairly certain my girlfriend is going to leave me because of this game, and how much money I don't seem to have because of it."
♥♥♥♥ing great
This is the best hat simulator money can get. with just hats you win the game no questions asked
I got beat to death by an american with a fish while playing as a fat russia holding a sandwich. 10/10
trust me its good quality weed
Everyt... HATS. Gamep... HATS. Weapo... HATS. Syst... HATS. Matc... HATS. Graph... HATS. Classe... HATS. Team Hats 2.  Goo... HATS. 7/...HATS

"TF2 Ah Old TF2, One of my favorite FPS games and since it's free it's even better! You should get this game!"
Fun and addicting. Stole my money and took my social life away  Congrats.
One of the best games ive ever played !!!
This game's awesome. It's basically a male dress-up game.   I've been playing this game for like forever. What century is it now?
This its the funiest game i ever played.
"I love the game. I play it sometimes ut when i get my new computer, ill play it even more!!"
I used to have money.
10/10 Perfect and good hat simulator :D
"i havent played this game much, but its pretty fun so far."
Team fortress 2 is a very fun game and it has some beautiful hats.
How to make profit  1) Release new update for tf2 2) introduce 100 new hats 3) introduce only 1 new weapon 4) everyone hates on you for not bringing new weapon 5) people are still stupid enough to buy the hats (including me) 6) ????? 7) profit
TF2:  1. Awesome FPS 2. Epic trading system 3. Free to play!!!!  Yes i do Recommend this game! :DDD
"Best game I have ever played. good wepons, funny taunts and more"
Call of Duty iz for BABIES!
"The game is really good! The cartoon style is really nice, and it doesn't even require a good computer. Only con is that it's only optimized for 24 players, but it's still possible to have 32 players at once. Well, it's not really a con but it's kinda wierd. 10/10 in my opinion, great to play with and without friends, overall a great game."
A Great shooter game that I think is better than counter strike
Get It NOW!
"Valve, slowly turning TF2 into a money paradise for Valve while we are simply buying useless stuff.  Volvo pls, make TF2 great again.  TF2 is sh*t ever since matchmaking.  Must blame matchmaking.  You must punch the Matchmaking, kick the Matchmaking, kill the Matchmaking.  F*ck you Matchmaking.  Matchmakingception.  Matches? No, Matchmaking, making matches go macho.  MATCHESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!  FUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Volvo makes sh*tty matches, Volvo fix yo matches.  Must match harder.  Time to play match match matcher matchiest matcho machoer."
i think everyone agree's that team fortress 2 is the most fun and creative FPS ever to rule the earth :3 
"Thanks to this game, here is a list of results that happened to me: 1. I lost all taste in gaming. 2. I traded in all of my other, better games, so I could by steam cards. 3. I wasted all of the money on those steam cards for keys, just so I could find an unusual 4. I lost all of my money and went broke. 5. I lost my job. 6. I lost the respect of my family and friends. 7. I lost my house. Now I live in my mother's basement, as she feeds me diet food, and milkshakes. She sometimes tries to kick me out and make me find a job, but I weigh too much to move. Overall, this game is amazing, anyone should play it. 100000000000000/10. "
Great multiplayer game - Endless possibilities
I Highly Recommend this Free To play Multiplayer game its fun and humorous.
Ok Listen Buddy Listen HEY! Look at my eyes when i talk to u This Game. Ok¿ this game is my fav of all time best game of all time. This game only has 3 styles ok?

waste all your money
"Its a great game and I appreciate the 9 years worth of work put into this, but like every game; there are flaws. It's mainly glitches and exploits like the sandvich exploit to get endless points without cheating but this game sets the standards for what a first person shooter should be and if you had a mind you would think the same. Thank you ~Kaifyre"
Absoloutley AWESOME!!!!
"=My Favorite Game I Have Ever Played Out Of About 100 Games....= =Great Multiplayer= =Honestly Valve, You Should Add A SinglePlayer Just For Fun= =Awesome Community= =Awesome Gamemodes= =Definately Reccomend It= ()()Hope This Made You Buy The Game()() ()() By: GibbleHD ()()"
Tf2 is a fun multiplayer shooter thats heavily based on team play with a variaty of classes. If you like how it sounds you might like it; I surtenly do!
Team Fortress Hats Half Life 3 Left 4 Dead Valve Conga Simulator Gaben 2019
It's fun and easy to play!
Reallly cool game
"Maybe it's the quirky character personalities, or the over the top jokes, But I can't get enough of TF2.   TF2 has it's own style and personality that sets it apart from other FPS. TF2 is not a 'hardcore' shooter (although there are exceptions to this), instead it is breeming with dark humor, and stereotypical charm. TF2 may catch you off guard, but with time, you'll come to love it.  In TF2, each class is carefully balanced to counter the others, forcing you to work as a team if you want to win. Hence the 'Team' in Team Fortress. There are nine classes, each with their own traits that define them in the battlefield. The offensive classes (Scout, Soldier, Pyro) are the bulk of a team, and can pack quite a punch while remaining moblie. The defensive classes (Demoman, Heavy, Engineer) protect the objective and whittle away at enemy health so that the supporting classes (Medic, Sniper, Spy) can tip the scales and push back the other team.    In-game items are available, however they do not detract from the core game or overpower certain characters. You don't NEED to buy them, but eventually you'll want to. Most of the items serve as 'sidegrades', giving up an aspect of the original weapon for enhanced capabilities in others. This makes for exciting and dynamic gameplay, as you never know what the enemy team might be using.   Overall, I would rate Team Fortress 2 a 9/10. It's art and gameplay may not appeal to everyone, but you should still try it. TF2 has lot's to offer in the way of laughs at a very convient price (It's free!)."
Musttry for everybody.
It is an awesome game. lots of hours of fun:D
this is the best hat simulator on steam and the FPS mini game is fun 2   10/10
This game is truly addictive and the game with the most HATS ever.
Frigging aweosome i hope TF3 will come out soon
this game so awesome.and learn you how to loving hat :D
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEzd-pW4OBQ 
10/10. It's ok- IGN
I'm guessing that me spending over a thousand dollars on this game should by itself tell you that this is a great game.
  Tf2 is better than overwatch. Enough said. Eat sandvich. Drink Bonk. Pootis. Kill Gibus. Don't do drugs.
Its a Amazing Game
"This is a fantastic game! It can be a fast-paced first person shooter full of bullets and explosions. You can scale the map in seconds as the Soldier, or perhaps you'd like to turtle back behind the protection of your sentry as the Engineer. This game has it all! Not the fighting type? That's what dispensers and sandviches are for! I highly recommend this game and there's a reason I have 1000+ hours in it."
"9/10  As free-to-play games go, this is a worthwhile one. As the most vintage class-based FPS out there, this is a blast – literally. Filled with explosions and craziness, you can kill your opponents in the weirdest ways imaginable. This game, however, is not for people who solely enjoy Call of Duty. It is the furthest thing from tactical, with the cartoony characters constantly pulling crazy stunts. It is nevertheless enjoyable, with the option to play either against bots or people. Multiplayer is challenging, since most people are TF2 veterans and are equipped with crazy and powerful weapons that they have unlocked. With classes for almost any playing style, this game is a life experience to play."
This game is just so much fun if your looking for just a wacky crazy game that gets you away from all those realistic shooters
"One of my most favorited games on my pc! it's so awesome that i tell it to my friends, even my sister!"
better than the best!!!!!!!
"WHAT?! i haven't given my two cents for this game ?Are you kidding me ? hot damn...well here it goes... Well with more than 1000 hours of Team Fortress 2 i can safely say 10/10.   Honestly its the best First Person Shooter out there right now! Even after 7 years this game still feels fresh! I bought this game when i bought The Orange Box, and i'm still learning how to play the darn thing, thats what i love about this game.   There is always something new to look forward to, but i find i'm taking the incredibly balanced gameplay for granted, i mean the weapons are great, the classes have the best personalities i've ever seen in any game,   if there is any example that any shooter out there should follow, its this. every single class has their own personality, thats what keeps me sticking around when i play this particular game. If they didnt have a Meet the team videos, i would have taken it as another shooter, but not only that, those videos are really well done. Did i mention how much i love their personalities?  Also one last thing, the community, i really dont understand it but if the community didnt exist, this game would most likely be dead. Its not always all about killing each other, and using other peoples intestines to strange each other to death, sometimes some people just want to dance, give high fives,eat sandviches, and scream at the top of their lungs to have a good time :).   So with that i tell you, don't stop, Download the game, HECK its free! and start your CONGAING down 2fort today !"
"They're still updating the game, years after release. If that doesn't show dedication, than I don't know what does."
"I am gonna be honest........... This is the best game I ever played. I got ths game for like 10 months and i played more than 650 hours.. Valve you have done you selfs. Just dont give up on Team fortress 2. Try your best to get new items in the game. My favourite weopen is the tide turner , that is why i would like to see a new shields , maybe something like .... it does fire damage on impact or ... when charge you fly up in the air and smashes down on people.you must also make something for the engineer ..... it is a drone that the engineer can take control of... and dont stop making selley hats .. i like it. you guys can also try to make team fortress 3.. thanks for reading valve.. bye"
This is an Awesome game! Heres why- -First it's Free -It is the only place to legally make kids cry(unless you count Black ops 2) -Hats  -More Hats -Classes -And MOAR Hats!!!!!!
The First and the best game a ever played on steam(P/S:after watch dogs) BEST GAME EVER ♥♥♥♥♥ES!!!!!
Free and Awesome game! sometimes lags but Awesome!
I LOVE THIS GAME BUT SOMETIMES IT IS KIND OF A PAIN IN THE BUTT WHEN YOU DONT HAVE OP STUFF
this is really good game
"I've played a couple hours... Idk if you like first person shooters and love people who use there mom's credit card to buy vertual hats, well this is the game for you. It's a 'team' based game with awesome mechanics like how you can double jump as a class and you can shoot a rocket at your feet and fly 50 feet in the air and survive. Well you can bet your ♥♥♥ that Team Fortress 2 is the best game in the world, kinda. Sorry Volvo. But god damn can they make awesome games, like Team Fortress 2 and, nevermind I'm going off track. Well anyways since that your wasting your time reading this stupid message I hope you will play this amazing game and you probaly do already because no F2P knows how to get here. So you know what to do download this game play it like no other game and waste all your Christmas money and Birthday money on this game and be the god damn best W + M1 Pyro player in the world (Use The Phlog) because you know Pyro is the best class in the game. Well Heavy is alright even though I don't play him alot, he is proably my second favourite class, so I hope I helped you to download this game and remember never stop masturbating... I mean playing this game... Ok I'm done just play the game already, stop reading this I said STOP why are you still reading?!"
"The only things I don't like about this game are squeakers, the P2P elitists, and people who say 'TF2 is dying'. Overall, it's a pretty good game.  (also Japanese servers are the best)  9.6/10"
"I started playing this game in the Spring of... what, 2007? That's the year after it came out, right? The grand old days. I remember when spies couldn't take teleporters because the glow would persist even when you were cloaked or disguised, and the only way to refill the invisibility watch was to stand in a corner and hope desperately that nobody was going to turn around. I remember when Pyros had no airblast and Engies couldn't move their buildings or upgrade anything but sentries to level 3. Ahh, yes, that was a simpler time. A time before demoknights and mini-sentries. A time before crates and item drops. A time, by gum, before hats. A time when spies had their mouths crammed full of cigarettes, when wielding the Ubersaw was a mark of excellence, when Spytech provided equipment instead of Mann Co and nobody had heard of Australium. Those were the good old days, the golden years of TF2...  You know what? The game's improved a lot since then. Go play it. I still do."
Team Fortress 2? I believe you meant Hat Simulator.
Great game!
A game about collecting hats   -11/10
i like the smooth gameplay and different classes and modes
hmmmm a very intresting game but (MYM) destroyed it completely this is not tf2 anymore this is more seriouse stuff casual forces people to play and be a tryhard it would be better if they have not remove pubs completely
"I totally recommend this game to anyone interested. TF2 is a first person shooter... kinda. This game can involve wacky shenanagins, like bumper cars, giant strongman games, silly cosmetics, and watching really bad players. What i really like is that you can get almost a full experiance with the free to play option, with only some crafting, trading, and inventory space being limited. The only downsides to this game are the cost of some items, like keys and paints, and the glitches. Oh the glitches. Although sometimes funny, they can be a real hassle. There are times when you can't join games, have trading errors, are unable to turn or quite, and can only swing your current weapon, glitches caused by using the chat, and anything along those lines. Overall though, this game can be a lot of fun for people of many ages."
i spent all of my hard earned money to buy virtual hats thanks to this game 11/10
"What kind of FPS are you? Do you like to run in and kill? Fly and shoot lethal rockets to blow up buildings and players? Burn everything in front of you? If so, those are just 3 out of 9 classes with their own unique roles and stratergies. This game can use stratergies such as the use of sticky bombs or turrets or can just be a rush in and destroy everything with a minigun and a knife. Has many gamemodes for the player's desire and many weapons that can change the battlefield and is free to play. There is nothing to lose except all the time you'll be using to play this game!"
Welcome to Conga Fortress 2!  Home of the best Conga Simulator out there!   '10/10' - Everyone.
I love this game! it is so expansive and i would highly recommend this game to many people!
It's a hat and afk simulator; you've probably already played it. Hat mechanics rivaled to none.
Where are the fortresses?
love this game... been playing for it for a few years now. i'd recommend it to anyone! get it and have fun with it! :D
This game is very cool.
"One of the best hat sims of this age, the objective mini-games are also pretty good."
"This game is the most played game I have, Its not exactly what you call addictive, but everyone plays this game alot, and have hundreds of hours, but its not addictive, just something you play alot. This game is also very unique to other shooters. I think this game is fun, and can be taken competitively or playfully, either way this game is absolutely amazing and is free too, which is another reason that i think you should try it out if you didn't, why not?"
so fun somving in my pants got hard
Meh worth the price but only when on sale
"A really really good game!!! It's not like those pay to win games. What matters in this game is your skill!!  When u first started playing this game, u may always get killed. But when u finally be familiar with the maps and try to improve ur skills (e.g. stop w+m1 and start using degreaser + airblast + shotgun/flare gun) U will find that u can be the mvp more easily. JUST DON'T BE MAD AND FRUSTRATED WHEN U GOT DOMINATED BY SOMEONE AND RAGE QUIT. TRY TO LEARN FROM OTHERS. U WILL FIND URSELF BEING BETTER  You may even be strong enough to join the competitive community like me :) Looking forward to seeing you in the match making mode"
"Only played a little bit, it's pretty good I guess."
classic multiplayer
10/10
"Fun game which is very addictive, though the community is terrible, you will see 10 year olds spamming trade requests and swearing on the mic. If you get this, remember to turn voice chat off."
Tf2 is a great and old fps its community can be great or horrible depends on what your looking for game play wise its a class based shooter with 9 classes all diverse with there own counters and are all customisable with new weapons play styles and cosmetics even though some may be more loved than others *cough* *cough* the Pyro *cough* there all fillied with personality and some hilarious backstory to the team fortress world its a great game to play if your willing to spend money on virtual hats and stuff to have ANY respect skill may get you to the top of the leader boards but you won't have many people like you also since its free you get somr brainless players to. 8/10
LOVE IT SO MUCH!
THIS GAME HAS SO MUCH SHPEES I &lt;3 IT
"constant free content, random items drops, and tons of maps both community and developer made this game is a must have and for 20 bucks it clearly beats many of the more overlyhyped games like call of duty or halo if you have steam or if u play games or if u watch other people play games or if u just like stuff with the word game in it this is not a must buy this is a need a neccessity and a game not just for the average steam user but for all gamers in general"
this is the best game ever 
It's over.
it is very entertaining 
"This. Game. Is. Great.  I started playing after some very tragic issues in life, as I slowly became even more of a gamer and an antisocial. To be honest, I only expected a few hours of fun and then I'd be moving on, but, that was not the case. I joined a server, one night, and got sucked in.  The class diversity, the community (other than that of the MvM community), taunts, weapons, and most importantly.... Hats.  So, while most people think the community is toxic, they must've been in the wrong damned place, because everywhere I have been everyone has been very polite and nice.  With one exception, the MvM Tour of Duty community. People there are so damned strict with what they want, as they push through one of the most challenging tasks of getting an Australium weapon. Many of them have ego's larger than the ♥♥♥♥♥ on a black male, but, some aren't as religiously following this gamemode, and they will mess around if they realize being serious isn't beating the wave.  So, other than that, our community is running fine. Team Fortress has fought changing times, and has succeeded.   It's the game that you hate to love, but the game you can't put away.  10/10 would play another 1,000 hours and probably will."

"Very good, but VALLLLVE c'mon like, tf2 is still one of the largest income sources on steam... Pay attention to it... But a very good and fun game regaurdless."
i loved this game i've had it for years now and have never gotten over how fun this game is from killing every robot with a team to hiding in a box and stopping the cart and doing the conga with the enemy team. this game has kept me happy and i love it.
"I love to play team fortress 2 when I have time to. This game never gets boring you always have challenge's and you also have gun skins toto get to. There are always ways to improve you're strategy. There are always updates to so that can mean more guns, taunts and more. So I hape this was helpful and go have some fun."
an fps that has hats... ♥♥♥♥ yeah!
It is a fun game to play with friends. Plenty of servers and gamemodes to play on.
i love this game   its awesome
Best game i've ever played  Why?  Because all my lyfe has been wasted playin this shet
"Team Fortress 2 is a very fun free to play Shooter it's My favorite F2P game and it has been for a few years now the game is updated frequently with with patches coummunity updates and anuunal holiday events sometimes adding new weapons voice overs new maps new cosmetic items and fixes.   It's really a gem as it offers the same experince for players both premium and Free to play. TF2 is really some of the most fun to be had online when played with friends it can be such a chaotic blast!  There are nine classes to choice from that offer unique gameplay!  The item droping system needs some fixes in My opinion over time You get new items for free, weapons paint names tags stuff like that and if You're are on a premium account You find a larger varity of items.   Now the problem with it is that new players tend to use what every they find but there are some weapons that are part of sets and are best used with the other weapons in the set without them some of the weapons aren't very effective.  currently the quick-play matchmaking isn't very good so sometimes You are connected to empty servers, also there isn't any skill based matchmaking so You could be playing the game for the very first time and You might just find a game with some competitive players who well dominate most players kinda killing the fun but as You start TF2 it should be fun either winning or losing until You learn the game the best option for when You've become a regular player is to play with friends becuase You might be upset with how incompetent Your teammates can be at time.  But over all TF2 is a very addictive game it's so much fun to Me and I hope You too can enjoy it! "
"A game with muitplayer fun. A game for people who starts FPS games soon will get better with the game as soon as they learn the basics. Competitive when you are against a friend or any one in that matter. The classes are differnt in a way for good reasons for balance the game. This also show skills with one of the 9 classes depending on your equipment. It's a great way to make friends during trades, ingame expericences, and real life purposes. As a final thought just have fun with the modes, classes, maps, and items you'll along the ,so try out this game."
It's like playing hide and seek except with a bunch of non-sentient arsonists. 420/69
"Excellent and fun game. If the gameplay gets boring (somehow), there's still a fascinating trade system and economy. And, with it being free, there's nothing for you to loose buying it."
Everybody yells at me because I use a bow. 10/10
i loved this game before but now they ♥♥♥♥ed it up with the ♥♥♥♥ update i won't play or recomend this game until they make the game great again (dolald trump refrence)
"I really do recommend playing this game. Other then the incoming newbs (whom I use to be one), playing with the other players is fun. Especially if the group is somewhat trying to be a team XD. And the satisfaction of headshotting someone with the huntsman is awesome. So is airblasting an arrow back at the sniper."
Play this if you hate yourself
Best Game Ever!! is Free and is Still good Hit it up and Download it
"You get to kill things, choose from classes, wear hats, and it's free! So buy the game OR I'LL ♥♥♥♥ING KILL YOU! Sorry, multiple personalities, good day! I SAID GOOD DAY!"
Utterly fantastic! :D Love it and I have some fantastic sweg

team fortres 2 is the best game i've every played never lets me down on haing a good time
best game ever played fun for everyone who plays it im a trader myself and i love it 
"Hey look buddy, I'm The Grandmaster, and that means that I'm going to reccomend TF2 to you. I'm not going to write a half-hearted review, because that is just not my style. I'm writing a practical review. For instance, how am I gonna persuade you that TF2 is the best first person shooter I've ever played? The answer: Use a gun, and if that don't work, use MORE gun. Like this heavy caliber, tripod mounted, little old number designed by me, buit by me, and you'd best hope... Not pointed at you.  *UPDATE September 7th, 2016*  I love this game dearly. I've spent more time on it than I thought possible for an FPS, and I still see at least another 1k hours in me yet... Which is why it's so disheartening to see TF2 in its current state. Simply put, TF2 has been the ignored little brother of CS:GO and DOTA for a while now. For many of us TF2 players, this wasn't a problem. Sure, we didn't get as many updates, and sure, not a ton of them were very pretty... We were okay with that because the content we got was good quality and the game was semi-stagnant, but stable.   Fast forward to Gun Mettle. In what should have been called 'the beginning of the downfall', Valve added a bunch of new balance changes (as an engineer main, Gun Mettle is easily my favorite TF2 update to date), maps, taunts, cosmetics, AND also added weapon skins to the game. It was perhaps one of TF2's most beloved updates, and we thought was going to change TF2 forever... A less-than-impressive Halloween came, but we were okay with it because we saw Valve actually communicating with us saying that they had a 'big update' coming. We waited patiently, and got a tone-setting update that shaped our attitude towards Valve and the TF2 team: Tough Break.   Unlike the changes found in Gun Mettle, very few of Tough Break's changes made sense, particularly surrounding the Pyro and Spy classes. To put it simply, it shattered the community's faith in the team building TF2. Was it right for us to shape our opinions so quickly on one debateably failed update? No, but it made us wary about the future changes Valve could add to TF2. In many people's opinions, TF2 was much better BEFORE Tough Break. This marked perhaps the only time I've seen in a game's history when people started asking a dev team NOT to update their game.   To some, Tough Break was a bump in the road. To others, it was a complete disaster that showed how little Valve cares about the rented mule that is TF2. We waited for Matchmaking, hoping that it would save our favorite hat simulator. We waited for months with no response from Valve. No hints about the time it would be released, few patches in-between (most noteworthy patch was the Mayflower Crate one), not even another TF2 Comic which had originally been promised as a bi-monthly event. Weeks turned into months and months turned into a half-year. We started to wonder if TF2 would ever be updated again...  Then, MyM came.  Perhaps the worst update launch I've ever witnessed, MyM came out with an enormous number of bugs and issues that prevented many players from getting into games for days. Perhaps the biggest mistake I've ever seen by a gaming company, quickplay was removed and replaced with 'casual mode', a good way to play, but a VERY poor substitute for the quickplay we'd all come to love... Competitive was half-baked at best and a disaster at worst. The balance changes were less controvercial than Tough Break's, but were still mediocre overall. Valve had worked on this for MONTHS, but it was so full of problems that you'd never know it. I lost my motivation to play, and the only reason that I stayed invested was because of my comittment to a competitive Highlander team. The TF2 Team picked up the pieces as fast as they could, but the damage had been done. TF2's 'savior' had instead become its worst update yet. YouTubers like FUNKe and Muselk put TF2 on the back burner to focus on new games like Overwatch. MrPaladin abandoned TF2 altogether, and I honestly can't blame him. Things have gotten much better over the past few months, but TF2 still feels like a shadow of its former self. The community has started to split, and now, as I'm typing this, it almost seems like the TF2 sub-reddit is preparing for a civil war.  But yet, there's still hope.   There's a reason why I would still recommend this game to any gamer I'd ever meet. There's a reason why I have continued to play it through all this. There's a reason why I can still see myself playing for at least another 1k hours if it keeps going down this road: It's because I love this game and I still believe that it has a chance. Call it blind faith, call it pining for something that will never come back, I don't care. I believe that TF2 is on the brink of a renaissance. While my faith in Valve has faltered, and the community is splitting, I believe that we can come out of this stronger. Thanks to content creators like UEAKCrash and The Winglet, community updates are a stronger presence now than ever before. Both Frontline AND Mayann look like they could potentially be the best updates TF2 has recieved in a long time... And they're made by us: idiots who see something remarkable inside this almost decade-old mess. We still care deeply about this game... We, the community: the competitive players, the casual pubstompers, the omnipresent free-to-plays. WE LOVE THIS GAME AND WE AREN'T GOING TO LET IT DIE LIKE THIS.   Valve, your recent mistakes have not deterred the community around TF2. We are not going to sit idley by and wait for TF2 to become the next Battleborn. We will still fight and create for this game that we love. Even if it's just for a season, give us the attention that you would give CS:GO or DOTA. Do that, and see how many people come back to TF2. If you decide it's not worth your bother after that, fine. Hand it off to either us, the community, or another developer that would want to work on TF2. After all, your company is set up in a way that people get to work on whatever they want. I know that I wouldn't want to work on a decade-old game if I was at Valve. Look at VR, look at competitive CS:GO and DOTA. Who would want to put any time into TF2 while that ♥♥♥♥ is going on down the hall? I don't care what you do with it, just do SOMETHING. Don't let this gem sit and collect dust. TF2 means too much to too many of us.   TF2 is going through perhaps the roughest patch it has ever gone through... Yet, I firmly believe that we will make it out better than we came in. I believe that us, as a community can make this game what it should be. I believe in all these things because I've seen first-hand how many of us love and cherish TF2 like no other game. We've made countless friends here and become part of the best community that a gamer could ask for (well, minus the cancer memes... But hey, every community has SOME weakness). Valve, do the right thing and give TF2 the chances that it deserves. There's still life in this game yet, and to dig its grave now would be the biggest mistake you've ever made.  Sincerely, long time player and Engineer main, The Grandmaster"
Just getting started but very (x73) good game!  Already starting to ruin my life. 
"i was only 9 years old. . . i loved team fortress so much . . . i had all the hats and wepons . . . my dad called me a faget, so i called him a nuub he pwned me . . . i was lying in my bed crying as the tears role down my cheeks i felt i warmth touch me . its the heavy! he whispers in my ear *this is my controll point* he grabs me i want to please him"
I heard you shoot people in this game while working together as a team.
11/10
Good game 10/10 IGN Hat Fortress 2 Get It Now  :3 
"Ladies and Gentlemen, these days, this usually awesome game, is disapointing. I can see a link to them attempting to copy Overwatch, but they failed miserably and ruined the fun and atmoshpere of the game. When previously you could connect to your favorite Pub and roll some payloads with your friends, you now are subjected to painful wait-times and 1 time use servers. Players around you come and go, and the Casual matches are Competitive without ranking. These are dark days, and only community servers seem, somewhat intact. Where Team Fortress 2 used to be a unique and cozy hop-on hop-off matches based game, it is now a pale and wounded attempt to capture Overwatche's feel. But where Overwatch shines it's radiant sun, TF2's maps seem gloomier than ever. Our Lord and Saviour Gaben, Please save our souls that reside in the narrow halls of 2-Fort, or the dusty barns of Dust Bowl. Bring back TF2's welcoming and joy-filled mood, and remove these all too finite servers. BRING BACK THE PUBS AND AUTOBALANCE PLZ!"
"Buys 3 keys,Gets 1 Page Of Ref  11/10  Would Buy Keys Again"
i Love this game so much. Pluses and minuses +nice graphic  +funny characters  +well balanced game (only that phlog is op) +lots of content +regularly update ( at least 1 big update per quarter of year) +nice cosmetics items  +free to play +not pay to win +1000+ fun 
It's a HAT simulator not a HATE simulator.  But seriously have the CDC on speed dial people get salty easily.
IT IS GOOD
I play TF2 xD
Great game
"Dang, I love this game."
"This game is awsome and most of all the custom game modes that make the game the most fun you can have,with the hat,misc items and are also cool they were created by people like me,once you join a server u can show off your items and get your BOOOM HEAD SHOT moments all off this game."
A great team based F2P FPS with a breathing economy based off of virtual hats.
"I remember when Team Fortress 2 went F2P, I'm glad it did as I wouldn't have (probably) got this great game, the community is pretty good, with lots of community servers with various community modes (stuff like Minigames). The Valve official modes range from Payload (Protecting and getting a cart to a point) to Pass Time (Think of something like Basketball but in the TF2 Universe!), With Matchmaking getting an overhaul in the upcoming Meet your Match update, which also adds a Competitive Mode which is similar to another of Valve's games 'Counter-Strike: Global Offensive' where depending on how you play in the mode, you will earn a rank. Another mode in the game is Man Versus Machine (MVM for short), which is a six player wave based mode where you and your friends can team up against an army of Robots. The game can be played in various ways as there are 9 Separate classes with many different playstyles, ranging from a Sniper to a Medic to a Spy. Each class is customizable with different clothing options (Hats etc.) and they can use many different weapons designed specifically for their class. There are 40+ maps in the game (actually too many to count) NOT including all the custom maps available for the game which gives a lot of replicability to Team Fortress 2. The only problem I have with the game is that a lot of people like playing only 1 map (2Fort/ctf_2fort) so if you don't really enjoy the map then you may dislike the game, I do play this map a lot as I really like the way the map is laid out and a lot of the servers were just 2Fort so I got used to the layout and probably know the map like the back of my hand. My rating for the game would be a solid 9/10, Thanks Valve for making an incredibly enjoyable game!"
Better than COD. Got a problem? Fight me.
  Cool Game For Casual Players
"Great game, the style of the game play is well balanced, because of the otherwise annoying fan base, that supposedly always has something to complain about, forcing valve to change it.  The reason why some people might hate this game, is that they have a slow computer, or simply judge the class pack as unbalanced, even if it does shift the amount of that class to the entire team or something similar for a week or two. Eventually, it returns to normal. Another way one could hate it is because they don't join up in a clan and use teamwork, so TF2 really needs a person willing to coordinate their team mates using a microphone. Not doing this leads to the comments that the weapons are too weak or too powerful: Ex. A heavy, charging ahead of his them (somehow.) Will be picked off by a sniper, unless the team spies murder him with their ITTY BITTY KNIVES, then a demoman or ubercharged(Where the medic heals a ton and gets to turn a class invulnerable for 8 seconds) class may have to charge ahead to remove sentries, while a pyro burns all allies in sight, trying to prevent spies from sapping their team's sentries. A solider may need to use his rockets to also remove sentries or clear out enemies while a sniper removes the medic healing the other teams heavy, allowing his team to rush in and give him a quick death.    Finally, they clear out the control point, where the speedy scout can rush in and capture it before the other team respawns.  And that's how team work is used in team fortress 2.  The teamwork in TF2 differs from something like Call of duty, where a skilled player can run on in a blind frenzy, killing anything in his path, or a lone sniper can remove a whole team. Otherwise, Team fortress 2 is a face paced game where solo playing is hard, and skill has little use, creating a fun game where you could have long wars on granary, coordinated rushes and overall fun. The only thing about the game is that you may have to find a clan to do much teamwork. I'd give TF2 a 9.7,(For always needing teamwork, unless it's a pub and no teamwork is present) but score rounds up to 10"
the hats ruined my life. i give it 10 hats out of 10 hats
This is awsome. All i have to say.
"You honestly cannot beat TF2, good olf fashioned FPS fun!"
gud game 2 much hat 4 u
"If you havn't played this game, you are not a true gamer. So get it, it's free. "
"Free and fun, what's not to like?"
"This Game is probably my favorite game, How you can find random Items, Either Cosmetics or Weapons, and All the gamemodes Payload, Control Points, Ctf, Special Delivery, Payload Race, Attack and deffend, And my favorite Mann VS Machine. This game has so much to it. It is Awesome and I recomend it to any one that wants to start out shooter games."
Very addicting and fun. Great graphics and lots of fun for anyone that liks a good FPS game. I would recomend it to anyone who has steam.
like skyrim with hats
"Life? Psh.. Life are for wussies, Spent over 50$ on this game.  10.1/10"
Pros: + Lots of hats + Maybe the best online FPS that exists for PC  Cons - Could be more hats - Total sausage fest
"A great game, and 2000 hours and one electrified combover later, I would recommend for those who like the fps genre. THIS IS NOT CALL OF DUTY. That game emphasizes the ability of one man to go around knifing and killing. Tf2 is really a TEAM game. From a drunk scot bradishing a wide variety of explosives, or the pyro whose gender is still debated. This allows many actions like the dreaded conga and hiding in a box for the casual gamer, yet still manages to be fun for those who play for the kills (expecially after the gun mettle update). 10/10 would conga again"
"Somebody needs to count how many times Valve has, knowingly, screwed over TF2 and its community."
This Game Is Great
"The greatest, and leading FPS team-based game that exists. I thank thee for this game."
Excellent fun gameplay with lots of variety. 10/10.
"Honestly, after the MyM update, I can't say with a straight face that I enjoy this game anymore."
"so many micspammers, but still the best game"
"Best hat simulator I've ever played, never wasted more money trying to get a virtual hat with extra particles out of a virtual wooden box.     It's actually really fun, but a warning for all new players, don't waste your time unboxing. Trade4life   "
"Team Fortress 2 or TF2 is a phenomenal game. Not only has the community been strong for several years now but the game is free to play. Which means you never have to dish out money to be the best player, in fact one can argue that the best weapons are the default weapons because they are simply neutral. The only reason you would ever want to spend money is if you run out of space from the constant FREE item drops, which only comes down to $1. Everything else is cosmetic and will only aim to make you look like the ultimate badass. TF2 does a great job of not forcing you to pay to be good or be ahead of someone, so if you truly want a free to play game join the community!"
Awesome! Love it &lt;3
"TF2 is one of my favourite games on steam. Many of achievements to keep you busy, plently of different weapons and items to unlock, 9 interesting characters to explore for hours, and just fun to play with friends and eat a good sandvich. I totally reccomend TF2!"
"This is a truly amazing game and I would recommend it for everyone, if your old enough to turn on your computer or ppick up the mouse. You are able to play this game, and don't listen to those idiots who rage saying, 'Omg these little kids are so annoying, why can't they go play a made for them.' This game is for all ages. Ignore those idiots"
One of the best 1st Person Shooters out there for sure. I'd say it beats COD with ease.
This game sucks because spies should have wings flying around the map taking 0 damage!
It's good i guess...
300 hours in and I don't think ill be stopping any time soon. I love the comically themed graphics and the awesome community. 10/10 would recommend.
"its ok.  seriously. ive become cynical after all these hours wasted.  this game isnt really worth it anymore. the competitve scene is dying and the community is just... ew. wait for the next big thing, or wait until competitive matchmaking is a thing, but then its gonna be overrun by hackers and pub scrubs."
So far I'm 589 hours in and I love every second of it
"Welcome to Team Fortress 2. In the game of TF2, there are 9 classes. The Scout is a scrawny man-child that caves peoples heads in with baseball bats and then proceeds to eat a bucket of chicken over their dead bodies. The Soldier is a rocket launcher wielding psycopath that thinks that life is WWII, he also will blast his legs off and then hit you with a shovel when he lands on you. The Pyro is a masked 'vigilante' that sees rainbows when he burns everyone into a fine crisp. The Demoman is a, 'Black Scottish Cyclops', (Demoman, Meet The Demoman) He is an alcoholic who, one day, decided to grab a grenade launcher, a remote control explosives device, and a bottle of Degroots Rum for the sole purpose of slaughtering the masses. The Heavy is a fatman with a big minigun which is practically his wife and his kids. The Engineer is a lazy Texan that decides that sometimes, you might need a little more gun. The Medic is a German doctor who will either shoot you in the face hole with syringes, or heal you with a beam of health (the beam of health might have radioactive side effects). The Sniper is an Australian who urinates in a bottle and chucks it at his foes, which is when he beats them to death with a Kukri. The Spy is a masked French guy who puts on make up to look like the enemy team, he also isn't a good friend...... HE STABS YOU IN THE BACK!!! HA HA HA HA!!"
Great game with the besy community even if you only olay MvM or just Casual and then their is the people that encourage people to try and plat Mann vs Machine for the first time :) 
I recommend this game because it is fun and competitive at the same time.  Also You Get More Items The Longer You Play.
I rate this 10/10 the gameplay and graphics are great and thegameplay is soooo smoothe good job valve!
THIS GAME IS AWSOME 
"FIRST OF ALL, THE GUN METTLE UPDATE DIDN'T RUIN THE GAME  Want to jump around like an annoying prick who can dodge literally anything that's thrown at him?  Want to use your ammunition to propel yourself across the map at incredibly high speeds and shoot a barrage of high powered rockets in the faces of your enemies?  Want to burn down the homes of those you hate and simultaneously think about unicorns and rainbows?  Want to operate highly explosive bombs and grenades while shouting like a drunk scottish man wielding a medieval sword?  Want to eat sandviches?  Want to carry your team by sticking a life saving device up other people's butts and become the center of attention because everyone either loves or hates your very soul?  Want to build aimbot guns that do all of the work for you while you sit in a chair and drink beer?  Want to be an MLG 360 noscope champion who throws ♥♥♥♥ at people?  Want to use invisible hacks and kill other players in just one hit by pretending you're one of their friends?  Want to look cool with golden weapons and shinly cosmetics ?    Then play TF2. 10/10"
"This game is very popular and i think all round brilliant, Pros: a lot of varitey nine well balanced classes with there own streghnths and weakneses good community new stuff keep getting added  Cons: cant really call it a free game screwed up end of the line  But the cons arent that bad this is a really good game "
"What the biggest standout of this game is compared to other FPS is the classes. Nearly every other FPS I've ever played never really covered that sort of area. In some games, you don't really have classes, but perks that slightly change your character, but in this game, with the many classes and variety, you can play different styles which helped made the game something to come back to!  And of corse, the hats are (obviously) amazing and gives the characters different styles which is nice.  Then it happened...  The 'Meet your Match' update was clearly my most awaited update. I was and all my friends were really pumped for it, until we saw it.   Upsides: The main menu is a lot neater, with a better setup compared to the old version. The new smaller view models are quite nice and can be helpful and thank god passtime is out of beta! Also, it's nice that competitive has started.   Downsides: Firstly, even though the main menu is good, you can no longer make your own server, so goodbye tr_walkway, and casual is a mess. Pubs were completely fine and didn't need to be touched, but valve messed up big time and made it competitive's weird nephew. With no kicks and autoscramble, casual is the worst downside of all. And worst of all, we need to rely on community servers, which may have crappy plugins and loud ads. Thank god valve is seeing to it. Some weapons in this update has completely changed, such as the Shortstop. This wep use to be used as a perk because of the bonus healing, but valve completely wiped it out and it now has a, uhh... pushing mechanic? Even classes got buffed, like the medic can run as fast the heal target, which I think is OK on 1 side of it, but makes him overpowering as hell. And engies only need 50 metal for a teleporter. ONLY 50.  So the recent update sucks heaps, but do I still recommend it? Surprisingly, yes. Of course it now is kinda bad, casual is slightly improving (thank god) with waiting times getting gradually faster. Let's hope it gets better from here, or goodbye tf2!"

"This was the game that got me into PC gaming. I've had many a lot of games for PC before but Halo and Star Wars Battlefront 2 were the only games I had to give me an online experience. Like many I bought it solely for Gmod but I gave it a try since I didn't really have much eperience with the game on the 360 and it quickly took over my afternoons after school while my Xbox was broken. I believe the amount of time Steam states is wrong seeing how I played this game for a month. This was before the hats and crates.  You might hear people call this game 'Hat Fortress' and say that it's all about hats. In reality, they're just collectables used as a form a customization, not affecting the gameplay.  As for the gameplay, TF2 is a balanced FPS with many game modes to play such as: CTF, Control Point, a horde mode, King of the Hill to be played on a variety of maps. There are also several unoffical game modes with custom maps. And with the 9 different speciliazed classes to choose from, It's not long before you find what's suits you perfectly.  The game isn't your usual Free-to-Play game. most of those games are riddled with miicrotransactions that are made to capitalize on those who are impatient. TF2 has a unique drop system to help those who are new and with only one payment you own the game! With the trade system, you won't have to worry about not finding a gun or maybe even a hat you'd want."
"Try to survive in this unique world of team cooperation, F2P newbies, average players, who don't care about cosmetics, those hat-cholics and noble Unusual owners. Learn about trading and economics.   Have fun playing, when you got tired of all that money stuff, this game has a rich gameplay. Every server is pretty unique. Enjoy enternainig server mods.   And have fun."
"Amazing FPS, and class-based, can't get any better than this... Reminds me of good old times in Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory. which is excellent!"
"I am honestly surprised that this game is free considering how much entertainment this offers, If you're looking for a great competetive free to play online game, then this game is perfect for you! I have this game and I am really enjoying it!!"
"This Game. This Game is the mascot of Valve. It is the pride and joy of all Gamers. It is more fun than gmod with a mod on it. Besides that, YOU CAN GIB PEOPLE! PLAY TF2 Today!"
"What's better than killing big fat russian guys with a fish wrapped in newspaper and christmas lights, while having a police hat on that happens to have a storm cloud over it?"
This Game is old but it is soo fun. the players are freindly (mostly) and the classes all have great variety. I would recommend this game anyday. :)
"I remember when this game was a great game. Being able to hop into a pub and be a friendly player or just play the game. I remember when the matches i went onto were super friendly and we would derp around and have taunt kill wars. Oh, this isnt the past? Ok lets talk about now, fixing a ♥♥♥♥ing 'bug' where the bison hit multiple people, what?! Do you not read the TIPS you made?! And 'casual' isnt casual. Casual is what i remember as hoovies not being mercilessly murdered, servers full of dancing people, and games where you wouldnt have a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ heavies playing to just crush the team and make you wait another 15 minutes to play another match. It is basically a f2p competetive. And is your favorite class the pyro now? Every update is about the pyro. Tough breaks phlogistinator for example, you removed the damage penalty? What kinds of small minded people do you listen to? Im not playing tf2 untill you stop competing with overwatch or some ♥♥♥♥ like that.  EDIT: Valve just said they would fix all of this ♥♥♥♥ just so we would shut up, they release updates now that basically do ♥♥♥♥, the community is just a source of money for them, we are basically 'items' to them, if they truely did listen to us, they would fix this ♥♥♥♥ asap. They shot this game in the head and ran away with our cash. I wish i could remove that last sentence but they just are a good game company, mutilizing other player made items to make money. I play ark, that may be unrelated but instead of releasing maps or mods that other people made made cost money, they made it free. Look at what valve did, collecting items made by players and shove it down our throats. For example, gun mettle and tough break! They make it so you have to buy a $6 item and then a $3 item for a chance of 90% being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ item a 9% chance of something worth a bit and then 1% to get something you might like. And the only way to get items you might like is the market, and some stuff is overpriced, like a factory new skin can go up to $400 dollars! ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t valve, good job, you got our money now shove it in your ♥♥♥."
One of the most hillarious FPS game
"You know what? I recommend this. Not because it's a good game, which it is, but because I know that somewhere, SOMEWHERE, there is a person. A person that doesn't give any bulls about the outside world. If that person is readint this right now, pick this game up. You'll never see the outside world again, or the rest of your house, or anyone you held dear to your heart. But who cares when you have all these hats?"
"As far as i've gotten in life with this game, its been a pleasure playing it. Heres a few things you might like or dislike: -Tons of maps -Tons of weapons -Tons of hats -Tons of F2Ps  Play this game and be on your quest of getting the dream loadouts,hats and weapons!    !F2P/P2P!  "
"One of the best online FPS to date. Characters are awesome, voice acting is awesome, weapons are awesome. Class based, with a giant arsenal of different weapons to equip. Smooth and optimized performance, awesome fan made and oficial maps. Has in game store, were all weapons and cosmetics are. (Execpt for a few promo items.) But here is the twist: Almost all of the stock weapons which you recieve from the start, are the best. Weapons drop rather freqeuntly, aswell as having achivements which gives weapons. (Hint: There is a LOT of achivements.)  So in short: Play this game. If you dont enjoy, no harm. Its free. Just uninstall and be on your way...  12/10 would play again."
Best hat simulating game ever.
"best game ive ever played. and to make it even better, its f2p. the game has a nearly unlimited skill cap and it is the most unique and hilarious game you'll ever play. dont let not being good get you down, just keep practicing and eventually, u will get good and come to love this magnificent masterpiece. people say hats ruined the game. thats dumb. u dont have to wear hats and i wear a gibus with pyrovision goggles for the irony. dont worry about all the weps and hats, its still a fun game. no1 is making u trade all the time or wear hats. just play the game and have a blast with it!"
"Probably your best first experience in a shooter, but after playing a lot, you can see it is lacking a lot, and the major things you can notice is : non serious players, bad teammates and then some 'good' teammates who can get the kills but are only fragging. I give you an advice : after you reach 1000 hours, quit the game."
I played this. It's good. I'm Helpful!
I only played a little it was good
"I was going fishing as a big fat purple cat called BIG.It was at this moment i realized i was lost and i gots dis game, all i have to say is,if each hat i had was BIG TEH CAT,i would have all of dem fishies........AND MR.FROGGY."
cool shooter game  
"One of the best (if not the best) free-to-play games out there. It's not only fun as hell, but it's also the most balanced game I've ever played, completely free of any pay-to-win aspects. In my honest opinion, this is the finest shooter ever made."
"This game is very good. The gameplay mechanics are very unique to FPS games. Team Fortress 2, unlike other shooter games, isn't just mindless shooting at people. You actually have to plan out your moves, communicate with your team, strategize, and choose your loadout and class carefully. Unlike in other FPS games, you also get unique weapons. By unique, I don't mean 'this shotgun shoots farther, this shotgun does more damage, ect...', I mean that you have weapons that are unique to any game. A perfect example is the Sandvich. The sandvich is equipped as a secondary item for the Heavy Weapons Guy. When consumed, it refills all of your health, extinguishes you if you are on fire, and stops bleeding. However, it has a medium to long recharge rate. These and hats (decoration item that don't help you much, if at all) are what make Team Fortress 2 unique, well-made, and overall fun. Note: anyone who hates is from CoD."
"Loved this game, very good potential. I also like the comedy and humor in this FPS."
Played a bit it is fun :o
Best hat simulator I have ever played.
"Hat in real life = $20  In-game Burning Team Captain = $14,000 Hat simulator 2015 No one is medic; and if there is a medic, heals no one No hats, no strange australium killstreak weapons = n00b scrubb Noob with unusuals, strange australium killstreak weapons = Pro OP as f*** all medics heal the s*** out of them  9001/10 would spend my entire life savings on a game to attract medics and wear unnecessary cosmetics and wield weapons of no actual real-life significance "
Everyday is summer in TF2. That is all I can say. 10/10
"Team Fortress 2, 10/10: A Good FPS Team Based War Game That Allows The Player Freedom As They Go Round Killing Everything In Sight And Finding New Exciting Items To Add To Their Ever Expanding Aresenal Of Weaponry! The Player Can Take On The Form Of 9 Different Classes All With Abilities And Attributes, Unique To Their Personality. The Majority Of Maps Are Well Thought Out And All Official Valve Maps Are Flawless In The Team Based Fairness Design. The Economics Of This Game Are Incredible, The Trading Economy Growing And Growing. The Unique Twist Of Adding Attributes To The Weapons Is A Nice Touch; What Player Wouldn't Want To Kill Someone, Taunt Over Their Dead Body While They Sit At Their Desk In Awe As They See The 10,000 Kills That Your Strange Gun Has For Some Reason Counted. Now We're Getting To The Good Bits. Hats. It's As Simple As That, A Hat In Team Fortress 2 Is Like A Bar Of Gold And The Fact That You Can Find All Sorts Of Hats All With Different Colour Borders Speaks For Itself! Unusual Hats Being The Peak Of Coolness And Fashion. A Hat. All Well And Good, Right? Well Now Imagine That Hat On Fire! Apart From The Scorhing Feeling On Top Of Your Class's Scalp Things Couldn't Be Any Better! Strange, Vintage, Genuine And Rare Items, Hats And Tools Are All Available In This Game Now They're Sitting. Lying In Wait For You To Join Their Server, Kill Someone, Loot Their Body And Find Something That They Probably Never Had In The First Place! Your New Weapon. Or Even Sometimes A New Hat! Gleaming In The Sunlight, You Pick It Up Grasp It In Your Hands And Exclaim 'This Is MY Weapon!' Before Getting Shot In The Back Of The Head By A Sniper Who Then Proceeds To Wave At Your Kill-Cam From His Perch. The Last Thing I Have To Say About This Game Is That It Introduces A New Level Of Gaming. The Physics And Mechanics In This Game Aren't Exactly Unique But I Feel It Is In Some Ways Very Different And So Much Better! Thank You For Reading My Review, I Appreciate It. For More Information On This Game Go To:  http://www.teamfortress.com/freetoplay/ "
"Lag compensation, unbalanced teams, 4 snipers and 3 spies on blu.  At least you know the downsides now..   Upsides : Very addictive, versatile classes, great performance, huge amount of servers to play on, lots of differents modes and mods, every class has it's weakness. Team work is the main factor for winning matches. 8.5/10"
"Team Fortress 2 is an awesome game. You play dress up, do the conga, do the square dance, high five, play rock-paper-scissors, headbutts and sometimes you kill people in a very cartoonish-gory mess!   That joke out of the way... This game, even 8 years old, is still fun and it's still supported by a great community. If you haven't played it yet, just download it and play it."
"Old yet well updated game, a chance to meet many amazing people and fight many more. Wonderful."
"Skill based game where you either carry, you are being carried or you are getting owned because of your team setup with 5 snipers, 3 spies, an engineer defending the wrong point and you against the other team using all 9 classes the way they are supposed to. 10/10 would pay for hats again."
sure get it why not its free and who cxares about grmaemr yeha im diselquiztic whatevre dnot wrory auobt it amn~
"Despite all the hate towards 'new update' everybody is still playing this game.Nothing has changed,we are still wearing our hats,taunting and being friendly,or destroy each other to gibs.And thats what tf2 promises,pure randomness,hats and fun.First 10 mins to game you could be battling with blu or red team,but all of suddenly you could start doing taunts together or some other silly stuff.Is that all? No,there are community server which you can play such as zombie frostress,medieval fortress,dodgeball,slenderman servers,freak fortress,multiplier server x10(which is waaay more random),randomizer servers and even pony servers,you see list is just keep going I cant name them all.  TL;DR valve knows whats'up,if you want some fun and randomness,hope in,or if you want some serious stuff?We also got brand new competetive mode out.  All of those still doesnt change the fact this game is a 'hat simulator with shooting mini-game' tho."
"i really like it, this review is boring, im doing this for a badge :)"
someone knows how to fix tf2 hl2.exe has encountered a problem?
It's the best game in steam :D
  Team fortress two is possibly the best first person shooter out there i just dont like how u have to pay to get cool items or cosmetics
"A+ game, would install again."
Nearly 900 hrs of my life wasted on this game... But it's so good.
u like to shoot people? play dis game
"If you're wiling to give up your life,This is the game for you."
AWESOME THIS GAME IS SUPAH
"HATS/10: IGN  While I haven't played that much of it at all, I have to say that TF2 has a special place in my heart. It has the amazing ability to be on both ends of the tactical spectrum, you could extreme rancho relaxo or play a competitive 6s game. The possibilities are endless, so go on, its free, whats stopping you?"
You haven't lived when you haven't played this game before.
It has hats 'n' guns. Pretty much it. I don't really play it much because all the other players are incredibly OP kinda making it a bit hard to play...  7/10
i recomemend this game cause it's fun 
YOU SHOULD GET THIS GAME IT IS FUN
I don't know why but I love guns with lights on them And the hats don't even get me started with the hats
It's fine... I guess.
"This game got me hooked! I love this game because of its unique zombie survival gametype. It is so much fun to team up with a group and try to kill the hat-bearing zombies. They will attack you, trade you, beg you, grief you, and much more in this fun, action packed survival shooter. 10/10 would recommend"
As i am writing this tf2 is 50% off. do you see the problem with that?
"Dont think about playing the game,Just play it and you will have the greatest experience of your life"
Realy good game and(welcome to tf2 )
"Very fun and addictive FPS, also its free!"
"This...Is actually really fun, though I tend to suck at multiplayer FPS games. Smooth gameplay, fun classes with personalities, a whole array of items like a flare gun, bow and arrow, ♥♥♥♥ING QUICKSCOPING SNIPER RIFLE WITH A ROBOT HEAD ATTACHED THAT TRACKS KILLS, cosmetics, ♥♥♥♥ING COWBOY HAT WITH FIRE SWIRLING AROUND IT, and a...A DECENT COMMUNITY. Usually I see teamwork which is always good, the rare friendly heavy that throws sandviches, and Crash Bandiscout using Bonk and running to the intel, medics healing everyone, yada yada yada. It's even free, though their is premium-Which can cost as little as 69 cents. It's a real fun game, but the only downside is the new player friendline-Oh who the ♥♥♥♥ am I kidding, it's good for new players, takes a little while to learn the ropes but it's easy, fast paced (sometimes.) and fun. Only pet peeve about it is sniper class when players learn how to quickscope. Walk outta spawn, die in 0.3 seconds flat.  Overall: 8/10"
This game Is definitly one of the greatest free first person shooter (if you can call it that) ever. I would definetly download this game. It may take a bit to download but trust me its worth it!
"Fun game, can be annoying at times and has a pretty bad community."
"its a game, which you play"
love this game and love my friends on it some ppl that play are awesome i think if your looking for one to meet knew friends this is the game just dont pay any attention to the trolls they are no body but this game is amazing love it
Such a good game. Just generally fun. Thanks valve. Everyone says: 'oh it so laggy'. No it's not.
"Be careful, the wild conga virus still lurks these parts of mann co. !"
you all needs hats to live
"Great game with a great community, loads of servers :)!"
"A friend recommended me,the hats astonished me,the community welcomed me. 10/10"
It's good
"*Tries to play casual game... Actually finds a game after an hour of clicking that little badge* Oh! I found a server finally!... Oh, it's a community server. Yay... Thanks Valve!   But seriously, I think that back in the old days of TF2 it was amazing! And I wouldn't hate to say that it was most likely my favourite game out there. However, with recent updates completely ruining 'Quick play' I just find myself neglecting the game entirely. I know Valve has said they're going to fix it but until then, this game just isn't playable anymore....."
People call me bad when I kill them      gotg 8/8 ign
This game has ♥♥♥♥ing gay people in it. I like that.
"All my life I wanted to be a pro...a warrior and I just couldn't succeed.But then,I found it.The fate of the world was now in my hands,a weapon designed by the gods of pootis,a true amazing weapon that would aid me in every battle that I would ever be in it was...........the phlog.This weapon was made for me,but only those with true power could use this righteous glory of pure holiness that is this weapon.The beauty of this weapon gives me a hardcore erection that can not and will not be tamed.People yell and hate on me because I wield the power of the almighty.Not only is the weapon a very balanced item,but it represents life..time...and humanity.The mechanical look of the phlog represents us...as humans it shows that we are gears turning endlessly cought up in many things..but we are like this for a reason.You see...the gears turn and work together to produce the flame of the heavenly guards that once protected this weapon.Anyway what im saying is the gears help each other to charge and activate...the mmph meter.The pure skill and patience it takes to activate this will literally give you the power of everything,demons,angels,and even God himself.Once this meter has run out you go back to your slightly better than normal self.After having this weapon for over 10 milliniums,I finally unlocked the helment of grace and glory...this hat is.....the GIBUS.I CAN'T SAY ANYMORE OR ELSE THE GODS WILL PUNISH ME FOR THE SIN I HAVE COMMITED TELLING EVERYONE AND ANYONE ABOUT THIS IS JUST DEATH FOR ME.SO GO MY FRIENDS AND PHLOG ON. :D :D :D"
Its still awesome.
Ruined my life and my steam friends life  10/10 Best game that will ruin your life
I hate this game !!!
If you don't play this game you'll start thinking XBOX LIVE is a viable business model. Then eventually you'll catch bum aids and die. DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.
TF2 is by far the most elaborate team based rock-paper-scissors simulator ever. It has fancy headwear and never ending variations in strategy that even the most advanced RPS player will take years to master.
"Hello this game is realy great,and i recomend you play it! You may realy like it as well..."
"I started playing TF2 on August 11, 2011. I put it off for so long because I thought The graphics were too cartoony. but once you get over that, its a complex game with loads of tactical possibilitys.   I was not new to FPS games when I started TF2, being a veteran of Quake (1996) and Quake 2 (1997). The 'Weapons Factory' game mode already introduced classes and its tactics to me so adjusting to TF2 was not a big deal.   I used to enjoy PvP, but since the introduction of MvM, and its awsome upgrades, I hate playinhg PvP.  In MvM you feel like a GOD!"
This is the best hat collecting game I have ever played!
This is a Japanese turn-based RPG dating sim with trains.
"Flawless hat simulator! You start off as a poor irish unfortunate with nothing but the will to build the biggest tower of hats any gentlemanne of leisure has ever gased upon. From ghastly gibus to burning team captain team hatress 2 promises a rolercoaster ride of emotion, backstabs and hats. Download today!"
Team Fortress 2 where amazing happens!
it is so much fun to burn the engies haha
"The author of 'TF2' really don't know why we like to play your game. We tell you (the author) in fact, we play the players are mainly to enjoy the leisure game model. Winning is very happy, if you get rid of him, then you can not put the joy in the game above. Game player will not play the core mode is up to you, and other weapons to do. We all feel this update to 'TF2' into something else (such as csgo) games and temporarily put this game step on the foot of the game (overwatch). Sorry overwatch this game just TF2 a slag version, but why the update into the slag? If you really can attract players, then I have a lot of ways to better attract players than you do this way. First of all: the core (competitive mode) and the previous leisure mode coexistence. Benefit: players can experience more patterns, increase freshness. Second: core (competitive mode) can be rewarded for each upgrade. Benefit: players get rewarded and play hard for the award. The third: reduce countries delay difference (because now I play your server to use proxy channel) benefit: to expand your game market reduce foreign bad review (you would know the difference influence the spread of the game) You can give priority to the completion of you, I absolutely do not give poor assessment.

I have over 1'500 hour's in this game and it's still so fun !!!  Very balanced game  Many different game modes  Most fun ever
They have hats. Hats. HATS. HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATS And some worthless really good characters that add nothing to the game AND HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATS And a really damn fun community. AND HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATS.
"This game is by far my favorite First Person Shooter game, The updates are fun, The Comics are fun to read, etc. It also has a great story behind it, i totally like MvM."
Play TF2. Realise I suck. Give up. Months go By. Play TF2. Realize I suck. Give up. Months go by. Play TF2. Realise I suck. Give up. Never play again.  Fun game.
I definitly recommed this game for fellow players who are looking for FPS games that are f2p! My Reason Is They have new updates and that you start small yet the more you play you find weapons that enhance your gameplay!!
"this game is really fun to play with friends or without, you can easily make friends playing this game."
Hats. Great game.
"A well balanced, not P2W, enticing, awesome, fabulous, extraordinary and the most unique FPS experience one can have"
Its the best game ever
awesome u must get it plus its free NOW GIVE ME ALL UR HATS N ♥♥♥♥ jk but u could if u want :3
Its a fun massive multiplayer game. You get to choose the best class that fits you!
"Yeah yeah, people joke it's a hat simulator, and random crits are the bane of everyone's existance, but all in all, Team Fortress 2 is a great game to just try to see if you like it. There's no commitment to buy anything unless you REALLY want to buy yourself a nice hat or accessory; all weapons can be found as drops as a Free 2 Play player to equip yourself with and find weapons that match your playstyle. This game is about skill and team (hence the title, no?) coordination (and luck, darned random crits!) rather than about who has the better 'Pay 2 Win' weapon, like most online FPS games do. Too long, did not read?: Give it the old college try."
"Wow, what can I say..  This is simply one of the best games I have ever played. It has fair classes and is not Pay to Win. The military theme really compliments the hats to a fantastic extent.  Astounding."
  WARNING. DISCREET VIEWAGE OF THIS REVIEW WILL CAUSE UNAPPREHENDED OVERFLOWING EMOTIONAL MOOD CHANGES. VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED
best hat simulator 10/10
This is probably the best game ever made! You can't get enough of playing it! 11/10 stars! :)
"Team Fortress 2 is a great free to play game that I enjoy, espeacially when my friends play it with me"
"I've Been Playing TF2 Dodgeball Mod For Almost 2 Years... So I Got Good To It... I Made Money From Dodgeball Duels.... TEAM FORTRESS 2 DODGEBALL IS THE BEST GAMEMODE IN TF2 HISTORY!!!!

The best shooting game ever 
"it's a good game, so far."
"This is an awesome game,a lot of noobs but very good gameplay! :)"
This game has had me hooked since 2012. Great game; 10/10.
One of my fav games on steam hands down worth the download/scammers e.t.c.
i love the game and i almost have 200 hours on it.
"I find the new Meet Your Match update fine. Though i do think that they should bring back pubs, I don't think quickplay or casual should be replaced with one another. For me, it takes less then a minute to join a casual game. The game hasn't changed massively and hopefully valve is listening to the community and fixing it. To all the Meet Your Match haters out there, don't give up on TF2 just yet."
"Despite a few questionable Game Balances, I really enjoy TF2: Its a community that attracts many talented people such as modders, artists, gmoders, at this point in time it almost seems the fans are enchancing the game more often than the actual devs! The Gameplay is something different from most FPSs as it has RPGish elements/stats, but thats a good thing, and despite all the killing, for the most part its a very lighthearted game with each class actually feeling like a unique character. Besides its FREE, and despite the flack the ones who do play have for this: This game is NOT Pay To Win but it lets you experiment with other items with stat tradeoffs without waiting a week if you do pay. Paying also gives you a larger and better pool of items to find within the week forever!   I give 10/10 Plumz.           Noice."
This game has lots of gamemode so its really fun.And it takes lots of teamwork so you can make lots of friends !
"Good,fun team based game"
Fun and great gameplay.
This is the best class-based shooter ever. Tip: Do NOT wear the Ghastly Gibus as you will be automatically considered bad at the game.
I don't even know why I am writing a review for this game. It's such a good game it's not even funny. I probably spent about over 500$ into this game. Best game ever. Hands down.
Search Fortress 2  or If you want Waiting Simulator 2
"This game is just pure fun. I kind of stick with the medic, but my son loves this game, I love this game. I would deffinatly reccomend it. There is always people on also."
"Oh TF2. I started steam wanted to play Garys Mod, but i did not have the money at the time. As i was looking on steam, i saw this and said 'Hey, isn't that the multiplayer game i played on the orange box on Xbox' (I was little at the time. About 9-12 years old.) So, me being a new steam user, also with a slight (Major) case of not paying attention at the time, I didn't look at the price..... and accidentally 'bought' the game. I cried for hours at the time because i had my father's credit card attached to this account. (i was 13 at the time, so be quiet.) When my dad looked at the price, he had his trademark sarcastic smile and he said: 'well good job Co(errm, Trace, noone needs to know mah name.) you just made me spend $100 on a game!' Let me tell you, i saw my life flash before my eyes. (again, 13 and i had very little common sense... this was before I grew out of being a kid.) Then my dad laughed and said: 'Oh i was just joking, dummy. it's a free game!' And that is how i got this game. Oh, what's that, you want a reveiw, not me rambling. *sigh* fine.  This game, is Free. (uh Hurr Durr Dummy) Now, Free games are usually sub-par. But this game is different, due to it starting as a paid game, so it had a metric s*** ton of development. So the game is VERY polished. And is STILL polished. Now, time to divide this review into catagories. Gameplay, Controls, Graphics, Community, and it's Total Score.  Gameplay: 9/10 This game has a great style of play. You want to know why? It's different. It is not call of duty with regenerating health, or BattleField with Giant maps. The maps are actually not that big, but are of decent size. TF2 has health bars. According to the COD fan that is my friend, That is Bulls***. But don't listen to him. Health bars are great. It makes the game FAIR.... most of the time. You see, with a health bar, it makes you see how long you have to live, and you care about that. without a health bar, you feel like you could run around and spam the SMG or AR. And, along with the health bar, you usually have long as hell respawn times, so you really do not want to die. Now, let's talk about the classes and importance. There are 9 different classes, each with a use. The scout is there to ♥♥♥♥ off the other team and do chip damage, so others can kill them easy. The soldier is there to deal explosive damage to take down the guys with high health. The pyro is there to act as a counter to the soldier, demo, and spys, with fire to get the spys and airblast for rockets and stickybombs. Then we get to the demo, who can use sticky bombs for traps and deal explosive damage. The heavy is the allclass deterrent, as he can soak up damage, as long as you have a medic or sandvich. The engineer is there to add a line of defense, but the spy can ruin his day easily. The medic does what a medic should do, keep the team healed and shove a medigun up the heavy's ♥♥♥♥. The sniper is there as the heavy killer as headshots at full charge do massive damage. The spy, the hardest class to master, is to get behind the enemy's lines and generally ruin the day. Now, along with nine classes, there are many weapons that are unlockable or craftable, each with an upside and a downside compared to the defaults. If you need to get to the action faster, get the Gloves of Running Urgently for the heavy, or the PowerJack for the pyro. Need to survive as a soldier? Use the BlackBox. The gameplay itself is very polished, fast-paced and generally fun as hell. And more than anything, it is balanced. Shall we move on?  Controls: 7/10 The controls are good, but not the best at times. Yes, you can configure it, but i love playing with default controls on every game. WASD is always good, and M1,M2 and M3 are also good. But when the non-essential controls come to play, we have some problems. ZXC are used for character speech. Thats fine and dandy, but there are 9 different types of voicelines. so, the order goes as followed: ZX or C, then 12345678 or 9. But that's not the worst. CTRL is for crouch. not only does that hurt the pinky finger, but crouch is used a lot for explosive jumping and helping with jumping up larger objects. But the reason why the score is not lower is due to the customization for it. I, personally only changed crouch to L. SHIFT and that's really all, other than decline is at O and not K. And with that, let's move on.  Graphics: 10/10 Now, Graphics do not make a game good. It only enchances the game. But that aside, the graphics are amazing Many people would say the cartoon-ish graphics make it a kid's game. Faaaaaaaaar from it. this game actually gets quite high with the gore factor, not as bad as some games, but still, quite the amount of gore. But the cartoon atmosphere gives the game a nice, fun feel. Sort of that stupid fun you get when you watch the loony tunes or play Little Big Planet. (my little sisters force me to play it with them.) Heck, sometimes it reminds me of Pokemon emerald with it's bright graphics. (yes, i grew up with emerald.) And when i look at any light-ish green in the game, I get a large rush of nostalgia because it reminds me of my favorite pokemon. (yes, i know i got the dress wrong in my pixel art. I'm working on it.) So, in short, the graphics are great, and gives me nastolgia, but will not contribute much to the score. Moving on to my least favorite part.  Community: 6/10 Oh the TF2 community. you can be great at some times, but not all the time. Now, I am not a hater of anything, so long as you do not shove it in my face. Right now, TF2 is full of COD lovers, Bronys, pegasisters, demopans, Star_ lovers, Demospams, unusual flaunters, and more. Now, i am not saying these people are bad, far from it, but a large amount of these people shove it in our faces like we NEED these to survive. Not all, but a lot of them do this. But what redeems this catagory are the workshopers, map makers, good admins and hateblockers. The steam workshop has great stuff that would be great if it would be added. Some of the maps that people make are great, like Black Mesa and TrainSawLaser, even though that is a joke map. The admins on a lot of servers are nice, friendly, and generally are helpful. Hate blockers help with Haters, usually by adding logic into arguments and generally are great people. So, in general, there are a good amount of Fans who shove their interests in our faces, but the rest of the community helps with redemption.  Total Score: 8/10 This game is amazing. For a F2P game, it is more than worth getting and is mostly essential to a steam user. Now, this is Silph Co. is a Lie, signing out to eat an omlet. Make sure to rate, post a comment and if i got anything wrong, feel free to correct me, as this is my first reveiw. so, thanks for reading, and tune into my Amnesia, The Dark Descent reveiw next mont.

My hat is better than yours
"Ruined my life, 10/10"
"love it, first time playing fps, but this one is so awesome, better than the others"
A bit of banter
"I started this game knowing nothing about it.I did some prety bad misstakes (like buying from the manco store) but even after 2 years i am still playing it.it is a very fun game to enjoy,especialy with your friends! there may be tryhards and hackers,but the game still rocks!so just download it,it's free damm it! what are you still reading start downloading!"
"Since my Xbox Live membership expired, I suddenly had an influx of time but a friend told me that Team Fortress 2 was now free and could run on Mac, I decided to give a try. In my first game, Attack/Defense on DeGroot Keep I was just struck by this rainbow of fun in this game. The community is great and players who know what they're doing are great and get out a good number of laughs. Overall, great game."
Great game. The main game for purchasing all your other games is TF2. Thanks for a great game. :D
Best Hat Simulator 2014  Heavy/10
All about hats
one of my favorite games
Hello fellow steam players out there if you don't have this game you should get it if you like free steam games and first person shooters combine it togehter and get TF2!
NO DOUBT THE BEST GAME ON THE INTERNET!!!!! WOOOOOO!!!!!
"Very nice because of hats, Well done because done cause of hats, really tho its great beast one of the best games on steam no lie!"
Its a good game. Might aswell call it hat simulater 20*insert year here* .. Tons O' hats. Effects for hats. There are nice players. There are badplayers. Dont get into the trading economy early. Boom. Review finished
best game and will be the best 4ever!&lt;3
I shot someone once  420/69
It's alright I guess
"Bought it in 2011 and have had hours of fun, though I tend to try harder than most people you find and get frustrated. Good for some casual shooting though."
This game sucks 10/10
Beware the Hat Simulator
Highly addictive and very rewarding when you get good at it.
"Just do the conga, and you're already winning."
'You know where ya oughta hide next time? Back in France.' - Engineer  11/10
I could have been doing so much else with my life but I chose to play TF2  10/10 - Spent more money on this than an average drug user
"Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is such a great game i was shocked when i played it because when i saw trailers i thought oh its just another first person shooter but it was more than that. It is so fun and addicting that sometimes i leave myself trapped in the game, Yet some classes are kinda boring and yet useless its fun to switch around with classes so thumbs up for that! Thanks Valve for making such a great game, and keep up the good work oh and by the way another game selection HALF LIFE 3 I REPEAT HALF LIFE 3"
"I just love this game! I think it's the best balanced game ever! I also like the viarity of choice there is with all those very different 9 classes. Every class and map has it's own strategy, which is really fun to figure out. I have done nothing else last few months than playing this game! I highly recommend you installing and playing this game! It's so much fun!"
"► Game: Team Fortress 2 ► Genre: FPS, Action, Hat-Wearing Simulator ► Rating: ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ 5/5  ▲ Favorable Aspects: Back in 2007, when it was released, not a lot of people had knowledge about this nowadays masterpiece, prefering to play games such as CS and it's mods. But what did TF2 have that none other game at the time could achieve? Well, we can point out many reasons, but I'll only detach two: game experience and simple gameplay. Combine a 'cartoon' graphics FPS game with lots of classes, funny characters and objectives, then you'll get a different gamestyle everytime you join a match. I won't extend it because pratically every decent FPS gamer should've already played it or at least took a look, just ask around.  ▼ Negative Aspects:  As every work has it's weak spots, it couldn't be different with TF2. To summarize: the addition of hats along with all the cosmetic items brought good and bad effects. The good (specially for Valve): you can customize your character outfit the way you like it, for a price of course. The bad is the unequal proportion between cosmetic and weapon updates, since they introduce a lot more cosmetic items than weapons. Besides, it was spent enough time to produce a new Team Fortress title.  ► How much is it worth to pay: [●] Full Price* [ ] 75% [ ] 50% or Less  * Fortunately, it's a Free to Play game since a 2011 update. "
"It's free... Until you get adddicted enough to buy premium! Great game, try it"
"Great casual stop, but no more hats plz ^^'"
#Suppercaliswaggilishousawesomalicoolish
"I remember when this game was Pay2Play, good times back there! Still its a really good Free2Play, 1 of the TOP10 F2P Steam Games.  10/10"
Its Fun and FREE! (Edit) After wasteing 4-5 years of my life I see that warframe is a way better game
"If you're reading this, you're probably on my friends list. And if you're on my friends list, you probably already own TF2. So you probably already know how awesome this game is. :D  'If it were a bad game, i wouldn't be sittin' here, recommending it to ya now would eye?' :3"
"Team Fortress 2 is the best class-based combat game out there. The game requires you to take responsibility for playing a class when they are badly needed (example: A defending team is made up of mostly Snipers and Spies, and the attacking team is advancing quickly. What you as a player should do is take up the role of a good defense class like Engineer to fill the gap created by team members.). In other words, an effective player should be able to adapt to any situation based on how their team is performing. I am not alone in saying that this is a feature that makes the game great, along with some other unique features like hilarious characters, gameplay, different acquirable items that can drastically change the way you play, unique gamemodes, and of course, hats. For god's sake, it's free! Nothing should be stopping you from getting this game!"
"Before I got my own computer (which is nowhere near top notch. It came with windows 8 and the best thing it can run is Outlast at minimal setting), I had a crappy laptop that could barely even run RuneScape at minimal graphics. TF2 was something I wanted to play for a long time, and it's one of the primary reasons I got a computer, but enough about me not having the game, let's talk about me HAVING the game...  Tf2, although being Free to play, it does not suffer from any of the downsides of F2P. There are no ads that cover ♥♥♥♥ up when you first get on, and there's no 'Paying for upgrades' or any nonsense like that. The only things you can pay for are accessories and taunts, which are completely cosmetic. Guess it makes sense, being that this use to not be F2P. I like the term 'Free to start' since many 'F2p' games are just ad-covered piles of pay-to-win bull crap, but TF2 is probably the only game I've played that truely deserves the name 'Free to Play'.  ANYWAY, right, gameplay. Rather than being some generic, borring, zero-personality gunsman. You instead get to choose between 9 classes that all have different weapons, advantages, and weaknesses, and they all have different, yet easy to remember voices that are hilarious and cheesy. It's also easy to reccognize what characters are what, even if they're not holding out a noticable weapon. The gameplay is fast, moving around doesn't mess up your aiming reticule, but you do have to be quick with the mouse to be able to stop some fast moving targets. All the official game modes are team-based, and involve capturing and/or defending a point from the other team. There's no friendly fire, so you don't have to worry about any teammates lighting you on fire or anything, just watch out for spies..."
"So far the game Team Fortress 2 is a good game to play it is also a fun and an exciting game with the updates comeing up i like how they come up with new and better animations like wepons,hats,and other cool stuff to put on your player.I hope the creators of the game will be adding or puting in more cool stuff in the game soon like the end of the line."
Nice hat simulator had plenty of fun playing it.
"Love TF2, though could use less of the hat simulator. Have recently started getting into the competitive scene, and enjoying it more. By far one of my all-time favorite games. And yes, I am currently addicted...  9.5/10"
its ok i guess :L
It's all about da Hats man.
"This game is free, fun, cartoony, and has a pretty good community behind it. The weapons in the game are truly unique, the trading system is good, and alot of good and friendly players are in the game. I didn't find any bad downsides to the game besides the usual unfriendly player. All in all, One of steams best free to play games you can get."
excellent. consumed my youth. 10/10
"Great game, lots of shooting and fun to play with friends"
"Now before I begin, Team Fortress 2 is an epic first person shooter game from the start. A summary of the story would be how two companies (teams) are fighting to claim land. 9 mercenaries have been hired to fight for the land. Each mercenary is quite different from each other, and have their own specific role. The game is quite fun and is mostly focuses on team work, and communicating. You also find and trade tons of weapons, gear and, hats throughout the game. The game is not pay to win as you can find every weapon in the game :P, and if you find the same weapon you can craft them into different weapons or hats!!! Another alternative is to trade with your friends online, or to buy them in the shop. Unlike most other games, team fortress 2 has many game modes, a few of them are: CTF, KOTH (King of the Hill), Payload( Move a bomb into the enemies base, and watch as it explodes :D), Capture control points, and boss fights! There are tons of maps you can play some made by the creators of tf2, Valve, and custom maps made by awesome people like yourself. There are many cool updates, in which new equipment and maps are added to the game. Want to see what people have created, and hope in adding? Then, visit the steam workshop for tf2 and explore! Hey, did I mention that even you, yes YOU can create an item in hope of it getting added to the game :D And on top of that people create thousands of funny, amazing animations using SFM(Source film maker) using TF2 :D. O and if you want to be different from the rest, well not to worry as you can customize how your mercenaries look like with hats, cosmetics and even more hats :D! Would rate it a 100/10"
This game is one of the best Free To Play games on steam..........
"After playing this game for almost 500 Hours, this is the best game I have ever played. I don't even know where to begin. The Characters, the weapons, the cosmetics, it's extremely addicting. But most importantly, the community support. This game came out in Oct 2007! that's ridiculous!  10/10"
"Great game, fast paced FPS which won't dissapoint anybody who loves fun FPS shooters."
I sweat out this game so much!
Great Game 10/10
I love this game so much! All of the game modes combined with all of the customization and creativity this game has to offer is amazing. Please try it if you have not played it yet. It's free!
"Oh, how i remember the good old days... 2.66 ref for a key.. 11/10 would trade again"
"This game is a First-Person Shooter, with a lot of costomization, fun gamemodes, big community, and good gunplay. This game is very fun if you play with good people or even your friends."
TF2 is an amazing fps shooter it also has tradeing and drop features. shop till your hearts content at the mann co store or simply go to the steam market.it constintly adds updates wich include new items and HATS GLORYUS HATS! wheter your a fancey foe or a plain merc the fun is up to you.
"I've played Team Fortress 2 since 2007, and it seems hard to stop playing it. The game has an atmosphere that makes me keep playing it like no other. It's great."
10/10 would play Spy again.
Amazing game 10/10 comical deaths nothing is to OP good to play with friends although somethings at MANN-CO are abit pricey
Really Fun and enjoyable game to play
"this was the first game i've ever played on steam (possibly same for most people), it's very fun but gets boring easily. i suck sweaty balls on competitive so that's why i'm usually in for casual or a fun community server (mostly community)  i also played this on the orange box (xb360) for a few years and met some dumbass on there, no i don't like him anymore."
Absolutly life ruining. 9.5/10 would rage at afterburn damage again.
"If you like having fun, this game is for you. If you dislike getting killed because you either suck or someone else if better than you, ♥♥♥♥ off. It's always funny to troll them and make them ♥♥♥♥ themselves over the mic. This game is priceless."
i know the truth behind pyro....... DO YOU HEAR ME STEAM!!!! VALVE!!!!! YOU CANT HIDE IT ANYMORE!!!!!!  i may not know whats behind that mask......... but he is a veeerrrrrryyyy happy guy.
"fun,F2P, mostly nice people, great game"
"A game where you can have some fun with your friends and play around on casual servers. Or you can get into competitive tf2 and practice all day at the game to become good to finally create a team of friends or new people to get to know and play with.  The game itself is full of content such as many fun playmodes, hats and miscs, weapons and taunts such as squaredance. (Yes you can dance in this game). There are 9 classes and everyone is special from one another and every single one of the classes takes time to learn and get good at.  Teamfortress 2 is a game for the casual player but also for the competitive player. "
"Team fortress 2 is a very fun game. Interesting graphic choice that makes it stand out, way better characters than what a multiplayer only fps should ever have, lots of fun gamemodes (my favorite is the mann vs machine gamemode) and a crap ton of guns, swords, knifes and baseball bats among other types of weapons. Sadly the game is pretty bug filled. But it's free. So check it out and have a great time!"
"Alright, I've been thinking. When life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade - make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don't want your damn lemons, what am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life's manager. Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons. Do you know who I am? I'm the man who's gonna burn your house down! With the lemons. I'm going to to get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!"
All em Hats! You should try this game it's awesome!!!
AWESOME GAME totally recommend it.
"It's a good game, somewhat nice community, ( depends which servers you lurk in and what kind of people you meet ) decent graphics, hats, and countless opportunities to use your life saving on virtual goods that, most of the time, have no meaning and will not help you improve at the game what so ever. Like seriously stop judging people by their hats."
Absolutely and undisputedly the best free fps game out there for pc . Excellent replay value and you will never get tired of it . Constant updates and new weapons and engaged in a never-ending thirst for blood battle:D keeps u hooked onto this game
Anyone who is a fan of FPS games and hats should play this. 
Best waste of time money doesn't buy.

"After the new update, tf2 is pretty much a duplicated version if Overwatch in the sucks way. But its still quite fun to play and there is a tons of stuffs to learn too. The best thing is to try it out yourself."
"My most played game, cos its one of the best. its free2play but its deffo not pay2win best game ever"
"man dis game's 2 rad, every1 shud play it like dang"
It's free. Get it.
"This game is going downhill really fast. It's nearly impossible to play MvM without a stupid popup kicking you out of the game. Even the recent update claims they fixed it. Well, they fixed it for probably a few weeks and now it's back. This isn't the only thing to complain about in this game. There's still a lot to say about the new overlay that got rid of Valve servers and now we have comp and casual. Can't we just go back to the browser where there were tons of normal game servers and a lot of the wacky ones? This game used to be great, and it needs a lot of work"
"After the meet your match update, everything went wrong that's why many people hate the casual matchmaking update that definitely ruined the fun in pub games. Well goodluck for the future Tf2 developers, players of this game are currently decreasing :I"
"soldiers are so overused in this game. if you can go to a lobby where a whole team consists of soldiers, then you are good"
fun game and very action packed. I would love more claases and the heavy is the best class i would have to say
"Probably my favorite game. Some hate it, others love it (like me)"
"Hats. Oh, the Hats."
It's k.
"What the ♥♥♥♥ has happened ? All I wanted was to play casual payload for hours and now I can't anymore. Payload has been changed in all game modes, casula and competetive. Now you aren't just wanting to push the cart over the map, you also have to do it in the fastest time. This should have been a new game mode, insted of a change to a popular game mode.   It takes hours compared to the usual time to find a public match. Before I could get into a match a minute after loading the game. Now I am lucky if it isn't 10. Not to mention that you get kicked out of the match after every game. So now it could take hours to play my usual 5 games.   So to actually play what I want to I now have to find a community server to play on, which is stupid (Given how many traiding servers are out there).  And to add insult to injury, you get put to the back of the queue IF YOU LEAVE A PUBLIC MATCH! What has happened to to Valve? Do you just like getting pleasure out of killing your games?   Stuff this new update, RIP TF2."
-click on casual -wait 45 minutes or more to finally join a server -3 people from your team leave -9 vs 12 -cannot leave because penalties  Fantastic job Valve. You really outdid yourself there.
Change this tf2 game back to the tf2 we known and loved
"I was a former TF2 player before i got VAC'd for using hack. but now TF2 still deserved the hackers more as ♥♥♥♥ing Valve changed every ♥♥♥♥ing thing about the gameplay and replace with Old Casual experience with stupid lame ♥♥♥ CS:GO knock off 'Casual Match up instead', Great job once again, ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥."
My proffesional opinion? 10/10
"Team Fortress 2 is the ideal game for a casual gamer. Despite the recent controversies, the game still holds its weird, silly and overall enjoyable gameplay and is without a doubt a must-have (mainly because it's free to play) for a steam library."
"team fortress 2 is one of the best online expirence's ive had on a pc, the gameplay can be mixed and matched and the players are very nice..... most of them anyway."
NYAAHAHAAHHAAHAHA is all i really gotta say.
"Just get it aready. Its tf2, of course its great!"
The amount of hours I have sunk into this game should be a recommendation in itself. Or a sign to stay as far away as possible. Either works.
"I strongly reccomend TeamFortress2 (TF2)! The game is perfect. It has many different playing styles, you can never get bored of it. Every class is well balanced and requires different skills. Some may say the graphics aren't that good, but that really isn't the most important thing in a game, is it? Anyway, TF2 is amazing, there's thousands of different ways to play! TF2 also has a really nice charm to it. It's not just a bland boring army game, the characters are colorful, and actually seem to be legit characters, which is hard to find nowadays. The whole P2P thing is kinda stupid about how f2p are treated differently than others, but some are not so bad. But I will reccomend being a P2P, I just like having fun with hats and stuff.. Anyway, TF2 is an amazing game! GET IT NOW, OR GABEN WILL RAIN ACID OVER YOU! Nah, I'm just kidding, or am I?...."
"This game is a cartoony shooter, although some people like to call it a  hat simulator . And while it is true that there are hats, and some people care more about them than the game, it is still a very fun game with creative weapon names and such.  What makes this game unique is that everybody is not a ♥♥♥♥ing tryhard who has to win at all costs. Let's say you're in the back of the map as a heavy with a sandvich. Suddenly you see an enemy pyro coming right at you, and you prepare for your doom. But then, he stops, and you spend the rest of the game jumping on each other and feeding each other sandviches.  So in conclusion,  definitely do download this game . It's free after all, so you don't risk anything."
"I lost my whole life to this game, my wife left me, my children hate me, I missed my parents's funeral. I haven't seen the sunlight in months, because my addiction is so bad, I'm thousands of dollars in debt due to how many hats I have bought.  My whole world is crashing down due to this game...   10/10       "
Pretty fun to play when you have nothing to do
 The Worlds Best Hat Simulator!   (Now with war minigame)
Best hat simulator ever
This game sucks. 10/10
This is one of best Free-To-Play games I have ever seen. I recomend tring it.
no one's going to read this review.
"TeamFortress2 is one of the greatest games I have ever played. It is a EXTREMELY fun game with well balanced classes and weapons, along with the vanity items, this game makes for a hit."
"Ok.if your reading this dont. If you wanna know about tf2 and wanna hear all its glory,dont even Read the reviews. DOWNLOAD THIS INCREDIBLY AWESOME AND FREE GAME IT MADE ME WET,IT WILL DO THE SAME FOR YOU! -Bill Cosby Santa 2014"
"All that I can say is, this is the only game I play now, it keeps me wanting to come back and play it everyday. Plus for some strange reason I am now addicted to hats."
Came here for the steam community badge.
"10/10 IGN, NEXT GEN GRAPHICS, THE HAT SIMULATOR IS OUT OF THIS WORLD, AND THE FISH SWIM AWAY, THIS IS DEFINATLY THE NEXT LEADING GAME IN ADVANCED MLG PRO SCOPES WARFARE. THIS IS THE LEADING GAME IN ULTRA REALISTIC ADVANCED WARFARE.............But if you are F2P then the door to leave is on the left."
BEST SHOOTER EVER the only problem i can think of is the respawn time being random based on how long you have been alive for also when half the time i am playing i get killed by a melee weapon when was nowhere near the person who killed me
"Ugh, this game rips off so many other titles. 1.Jumping from Crackdown 2.Basketball from Madden 2k13 3.Killcam from Crysis 3 4.Switching weapons from GTA 5 5.Killfeed from Minecraft 6.Laser sight from L4D2 7.Water from Far Cry 2 8.Countdown from Smash Bros.

"I think of myself as a 'impulsive gamer.' I dont really care what I get, what it is, as long as something is in front of my face, i'm content. When you think of an FPS, Team Fortress 2 probably is not the first thing that pops into your head. But to me, I think this game will stay at a very solid #1, as my favorite FPS of all time; and possibly my favorite game of all time. With a hefty amount of both Pros and Cons.  No game out there has survive as long as TF2. Released in 2007, this game has been standing strong for 9 years now. This is an MMORPG game with a variety of game modes from players to choose from. A class based, cartooney shooter that has been living for so long. Pick one of 9 deadly classes, each with their own attributes and weapons. Choose from dozens of class specific weapons cosmetics and taunts to spice up your game play as you go along completing the objective. This game has a special place in my heart and will always be there. Even if the game dies and i'm the last person playing on a game. The game also allows for multiple customization options to configure you game as best as you want it to be. Even down to the nitty gritty, this game offers you the best playable experience for you to ever have. Download custom texture packs and mods to make it more enjoyable for you, valve at TF2 really cares. Constantly coming out with updates and new items, this game is far from over, it has just begun.  While the game is great customization wise, who's to say its not also best at the battlefield? Pick from over 12 game modes to enter, and any class to use. This game requires that you stay team based and work together to complete the given objective. Its not just as easy as you roaming around savagely gibing one player after another and expecting to top score, because doing that just makes you an unreliable ally to your team. This is TEAM fortress 2. Work together, and you will see yourself and your team completing the objective faster than you can say...  SKILL CAPS. No, dont get misled. Another amazing aspect of this game is that there are virtually no skill caps. There is always something within your 'class main' that you can learn and improve from. Each class with specialized tactics to learn from and improve on. Like learning to perfect rocket jumping and sticky jumping, or getting perfect head shots, or even airblasting like a king. There are no limits to how 'over powered' you can get in this game, which is why I love it so much.  I have been playing this game since day one of having my steam account, and have racked up 1200+ hours on it, with about 50 hours per week on average. With this much experience from me, I do think it would be improper with leaving without giving a in depth tutorial on how each section of classes should be played. (For players who already know basics of TF2.)  Offensive classes (Scout, Soldier, and Pyro) are the main attack force of the team. Whether it's assaulting Control Points or grabbing the Intelligence, these classes focus on mobility. Scouts have the ability to capture points twice as fast as any other class and can get there with their top-tier speed and double jumps. Soldiers pack a punch with their devastating Rocket Launchers, and can attack from unexpected directions by rocket jumping. Pyros can wreak fiery havoc in enemy ranks with a well timed ambush or extinguish their own burning friends, and offer the highest speed/health ratio of all classes (barring buffs or nonstandard equipment).  Defensive classes (Demoman, Heavy, and Engineer) serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map. Overall, the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups. Demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by. Heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces. Heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off. Engineers can build Sentry Guns for effective area defense, as well as build Teleporters and Dispensers for logistical support of the team.  Support classes (Medic, Sniper, and Spy) cannot hold the fight on their own, but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their team's favor. They offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game. Whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed, the support classes are always handy to have around. Medics offer a mobile means of healing for teammates, capable of overhealing them to 150% of their maximum health, and can provide a range of buffs such as invincibility, 100% critical hit rate, 300% healing rate as well as immunity to movement impairing effects, or 75% resistance to bullets, explosions, or fire. Snipers can eliminate key targets from a distance and use Jarate to extinguish teammates on fire and increase the damage dealt to the enemy. Spies can infiltrate enemy lines undetected, disable and deconstruct buildings, and assassinate critical menace.  Final score Team Fortress 2: 10/10"
"I made a review on Sept. 2nd, 2014 stating that this game was going to ruin my life. I was right.  11/10"
"you got hats,bread, conga and the newest addition is....... BONUS DUCKS!!!    but there is a good FPS game in here to among some other fun games made by the community its worth taking a look at"
I am now a fashion victim because of this game. 10/10 would dress my characters again
I wasted my life on this .
"you point at enemy, then click on enemy and they die  "
THE best game that I have ever played. TF2 Is a class based FPS. The classes are all easily countered and fun. No 1 class is too OP and the range of items that you can find is astounding. Some items help counter the class that counters you which I think is great. This is definitely a game that you want to play.
It's a game where you shoot people with things and wear hats. 11/10 gg no re would kiss again +rep super swag '58/5. It's alright.' -IGN
I love this game it is soo much fun if you don't have it then you simply have to beg your mom for some..............wait you don't its FREE SO JUST SHUT UP AND GET IT
dude what if we're all just bananas  and we dont even know it and like bananas are just people that were too insane to comprehend the voices of and then they scream whenever we eat them and its just likeaahahahahahahh except its not laughing its crying 4 its life and begging for mercy and oh god what am i writing
"Endless hours of fun. Protected against cheating, impressive trading economy, great community and well developed system overall. I play this game whenever I get the chance."
"Hat is love, Hat is life. 10/10"
"Really good game, it's an FPS with different classes (Spy, pyro, engineer, soldier, scout, spy, medic, heavy) it has so many great servers, and since this game uses the hl2 engine, it's easily moddable, i think the most interesting part about this game is the items, you get item drops from playing the game, that can be hats and weapons.  Pros:  -Great classes and weapons.  -Many populated servers  -Moddable game  -Good community... (most of the time :p)  -There are no OP weapons, basically you could say all the weapons are sidegrades. Cons:  -Sometimes takes really long to join a server.  -You can get kicked out of the server for not having the correct map/mod.  -Can take a beefy computer too run if there are too many people in the server I recommend the game, give it a try see if you like it. (No rating cause i don't rate games)"
Hitting buildings with wrenches can fix them. 10/10 for dat logic
Best f2p FPS game I have played.
It's amazing. I am just getting started and so addicted.
Spent $30 on keys. Bought all crates. Got Nothing. No Regrets
"Changed my mind. I've lost every little ounce of hope that this game might actually become better. Nothing but reskins and community-items are added now, and it was ages since a new weapon or anything good being actually added. Where's the good old shooting? It's nothing but gamemodes with idiotic powerups and Halloween bumper cars. I can accept unorthodox gamemodes in FPS games but this is just way overkill. On top of that, the community, my god, the community. If you seek cancer you came to the right place. Of course there are good players in TF2 and my respect to all of them who don't yell with the power of LRAD when they get killed. But they are a minority, which is the most sad part. The game is just overloaded by people who can successfully ruin your day in mere few moments of playing with or against them. And the community plays a major part in the game itself. The final two nails in this game's already swiss cheese-like coffin are the Love and War update and the powerup game mode one (forgot the name, even better that way, though). Many times Valve has shown how to ruin a game with countless additions by the likes of Strange hats and accesories (really...?) and Strange Pans... Gah. I can only sum it up with this: You were looking for a fun, F2P shooter? Keep searching. TF2 is an old dog with no chance of getting back to its glorious days. It's not even at its bronze age, honestly. It's just a ruin."
i really like this game and you should try it
"R.I.P Wallet, and absolutely NOBODY cares about skill unless you have hats. 100/10"
9 classes many ways to kill
"Played it a couple of times,not bad"
Good game i recommend it 9/10  Download now if you didn't try this
"If you like first person shooters , and you like cartoony graphics , TF2 is for you."
"Ever Look across a lake and see a shooting star fly across the sky? Well, good for you. Nobody cares. The important thing is Team Fortress 2 is not your ordanary FPS game. It's a really fun and challenging game, with up to nine different classes that you can play as. These classes are the scout, soldier, pyro, demoman, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper, and spy. These names need no introduction, they speak for themselves! Also you can use different weapons, all uniquely different! So when you see Team Fortress 2 in the Steam store, you get it! (It's freeee). So when this review asks me if I recommend this game, I say YES."
"This game is the best game I have ever played, its like jesus but in game form!!! And to be completely honest if Saxton Hale was real i'd worship him more than Chuck Norris!"
Logic Simulator 2015  11/10 rip wallet
"This game honestly is just amazing. I find that it's hard to get bored of this game even when I've been playing it for the past 10 hours. Just overall amazing.  This game has been out since 2007, 7 years later ITS STILL POPYULAR AND FREE (It's been free for like 4 years now?). Seriously if a game has a fanbase for 7 years for the SAME game, you know it's a good game."
I love playing TF2 i sometimes rage and sometimes im good. But the most important thing is that i having fun and i hope Steam continues to do this.
Welcome to Hats and Taunts Fortress 2 combined with CS:GO.
I love this game! Just love! :3
"Game makes no sense, dispense bread, eat a sandwich: 11/10"
"This game is very balanced. Even the default weapons in this game are very good. There are no direct upgrades or downgrades to any weapon so everyone is very balanced. There is normally a great community and there are multiple ways to play the game. There are also a lot of fun gamemodes which is nice, and you can get more weapons by simply playing the game. There are fun events, and this game is free to play. Try it out!"
"Amazing game, great graphics and audio. Fun to play, and very user friendly."
"Tf2 is a great Action-Based Fps, with lots of varieties of weapons, hats, effects, servers, and gamemodes. You can play for fun too, and don't have to spend a penny if you don't want too I would recommend Tf2 to anone from new, to old Steam accounts. TENOUTTATEN"
"The main reason why i play this game is because the fun never ends  I've played with the best and nicest people ever in this game  Also HATS, WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED?!?!?!"
"I highly recommend this game.  Side effects may include drymouth, nausea, diarrhea, eyepain, assploding burrito craving, painful hands, swollen face, swollen tongue, dizzines, fatigue, farts, burps, drowziness, constipation, painful constipation, vomiting, ♥♥♥♥y hands, earbleeding, and increased urination.  Team Fortress 2 is not for everyone. Consult your doctor before use"
This is the best free to play first person shooter ever 
The spy needs to be ♥♥♥♥ing nerfed. All these new weapons are completely ♥♥♥♥ing unbalancing the game and YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BACKSTAB FROM THE SIDE.
"When a FPS meets team play, fun, and strategy :)  Team Fortress 2 is a game that looks simple at first glance. Just pick a class, shoot, kill everybody, have fun.  But in the end, you realize that it's not that simple. Every class has strengths and weaknesses ; the more balanced is a team, the more chance the team has to win. And once you really understand all the classes and know them all, the game is just bomb.  So in this game, being a pro at CS or Quake 3 Arena doesn't mean you'll oneshot everybody here ; you've got to think carefully about what you do, and help the best possible your team.   That's precisely what I love in this game : each class is useful, and no class is overpowered. I do not count the number of games that have been won because I was a Medic or an Engineer (which are support classes), and because there were enough big guys in my team to do the rest.  And at last but not least, you have in this game a lot of fun contents (cf the pyro glasses ; or when blood becomes balloons, and fire becomes rainbow), which is the icing on the cake.  The only backdrop : there is a lot of noobs in public games that don't know how to play, and most of the time, it's the team who has the highest number of non-noobish player who wins. But that shouldn't be a problem for you if you're looking just for fun :)"
Can run around with a ham and smack people. 10/10
WTF this is the best game in the world and the game is also know as dan dan daaa HAT FORTRESS2 to the max!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
"I was only 15 years old I loved TF2 so much I prayed to TF2 every night, thanking it for the love I've been given. 'Hats are love.' I say. 'Hats are life.' My dad walks in on me as I max out the credit card to buy all the hats and he calls me a theifing ♥♥♥♥♥♥, I know he's just jealous that I'm going to raise my steam level, I called him a ♥♥♥♥. He smacks me and takes my computer away, sending me to sleep.  I'm crying now, I lay in bed, and my face hurts. It's cold, and I feel a warmth moving towards me. Something touches me. It's Gaben! I'm so happy, he whispers in my ear, 'HALF LIFE 3 CONFIRMED.' He grabs me with his powerful programming hands, I'm ready. I spread my asscheeks for Gaben, he puts a hat on my butt. It looks so stupid but I do it for Gaben. My dad walks in to check on me and apologize, and shouts, 'WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥?!' Gaben looks him straight in the eyes and says, 'PORTAL 3 CONFIRMED.' He flies through the window. Hats are love. Hats are life."
Very nice game!!! Now i can't work normally XD
only nerds play
Wasted 2 years of my life. Cost me hundreds of dollars and girlfriends. Lost all knowledge for everything except hats. 10 out of 10 would bang. Recommand to friends and family.
who needs life when you have Tf2   11/10
really good game whit loot of fun houers!
"This is absolutly on my top 10 to play games it is pack full of guns,gore,and cartoon fun. Its all of you're favorite game types pack in one. I recommend this game for everyone, its free so if u dont like it you can delete it if u want, but that is highly unlikely :)"
"This game is amazing, I can truly play this game for hours non stop. It gives so much costumization, the community is outstanding, and it is loads of fun. (repare you mind) I would r8 8/8 m8 cuz dis game is teh best tin deat ebeh hippin, m8 this game is gr8 and f8 made me l8 so i can play this game m8. Leik af u cri errih tim"
"I walked up to the enemy. I went for the backstab when suddenly, I get backstabbed.  Spy-ception  12/10"
"this silly and unpredictable game keeps you entertained forever. with a huge amount of weapons and accesories, there's always something new to be found."
"I've owned Team Fortress 2 since its release on the orange box and over the years its still enjoyable to pick up. Team Fortress 2 dominates areas of team play that hardly any other game compares to. A game where distinct classes are all important to a teams success in the battlefield. Each class comes with its own unique skill ceiling meaning that mastering each class can become its own challenge. Some classes even have multiple play styles that all require different set of skills that differ between styles, for instance while you may be good at being a “pocket soldier” that protects the medic from harm and kills whatever comes near you, you may not be good at a “roaming soldier” that does quite the opposite and rocket jumps around the map bombing enemies below. While no game has perfect balancing, Id say Team Fortress 2 comes reasonably close. The game is very fast paced and always keeping you in the action, and to this day it is still one of the best team fps games available.   Looking at the marketing side of TF2, I would have to say there is no free to play model I enjoy greater. The micro transactions are 100% fair and are centered around buying cosmetics instead of buffs for your player. You don’t have to spend a single dime on the game and be on the exact same playing field as everyone else. However buying an item from the Mann Co. Store opens up trading which allows users to make exchanges with each other. The game has successfully amassed its very own economy within the trading community.   I would recommend anyone who enjoys team based fps games to pick up this awesome free title."
"Very, good game couldn't recommend it enough it's amazing!"
great game!
Finally a dress-up game better than barbie. 
"This game isnt worth full price, buy on sale."
This game is just a bunch of fun and its free. Get it now.
Casual game.. with hats!
"Ya know what? this game will swallow your time and money for some good months before you realize that,and overall it's just a place for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to show off their fancy expensive hats and mock you on your every atempt of learning this game.Free-to-play? NO ♥♥♥♥ING WAY. if you want something decent on your backpack it recquires an abusive amount of money.It's a bloody disgrace.  BUT I FREAKING LOVE IT SOMEHOW. 10/10"
"11/23/2016 update: I nominated this game for the 'You Either Die A Hero, Or You Live Long Enough To See Yourself Become The Villain' award :-D ========================================  Absolutely recommended, regardless of whether or not you enjoy FPS games or even games in general. As it is free-to-play, it only costs your time to investigate if this is a game for you. This is the only game that brings a smile to my face and for which I laugh out loud every single time I play it.  PROS: -Hilarious team-centered gameplay that can consistently make you laugh out loud even if you're losing a match  -Distinct and memorable character classes that suit different play styles -Unique and pleasant graphical fidelity that suits the game's intentions well -Excellent and constantly improving level design -Variety of classic and newer game play modes provide fun for all types of players -Good bots included for offline practice -Wealth of options readily available in-game to ensure the game looks and handles the way you want -Many (emphasis) hats, other cosmetic items, and item modifiers available for customizing your look -Free item drops, with an average 1 random drop per hour -Many free updates that have added weapons, maps, production value, improved performance, story, play modes, and by extension new ways to play the game. All of this has made the game more fun over the years and helped to grow its diverse and largely vibrant community   CONS: -The addition of so much content over the years has had some impact on game stability, though this is often fixed eventually via free updates -Some nasty exploits available that can ruin the game for some players, though these are usually eventually fixed via free updates -No obvious classic 'team deathmatch' play mode. The CTF map 2Fort is often used as a team deathmatch map as a result -A lot of the story is explained outside the game via entertaining comics and high quality videos. I am fine with this, though this could frustrate players more interested in storytelling within games -The game is free-to-play, however a minimal monetary investment is required to begin unlocking more than 50 items. There is no pay to win here, however there is definitely more fun to be had when you invest more money in the game to unlock more items. Check this official free-to-play FAQ for more details:  http://www.teamfortress.com/freetoplay/faq.php "
This is an amazing game and i encourage everyone to play this.
AWESOME FREE TO PLAY 
"Where would I need to start on this game? Honestly there are mixed opinions on this game and writing this review in 2016 after 4 years of staying away from this game and avidly playing it I can come to one conclusion. If I am going to play /one/ FPS game forver in my life it will be TF2.  1. Restricted headshots: I'm honestly really really bad at aiming, I can at least aim in the 'general' direction but headshots? Seriously those are a big no for me (not getting any better after years) and thankfully in TF2 only a handful of weapons can do that so I don't have to worry about them too much.  2. Classes: Yes some classes are countered by certain classes so hard it's enough to rage quit but it's just how the game flows. If there's something bad because of that then it's rather to play games like CS:GO that has no such form of classes  3. Customizing: No not customizing how your character looks, how the character takes on different weapons and how to use them. One man's garbage can become another's treasure. Trying out some stupid loadouts can spart the fun time to time.  4. Nothing is unimportant: Each class has problems when stacked, but none of the class at all can become a serious problem. It really encourages teamplay even in 16:16 matches and I am really happy about that. Even if it's a newbie that just learned how to fire a gun it still helps in some way possible.  5. Silly moments: Sometimes, a certain situation is so random that I can't help but to laugh with it.  6. Easy to start, but unlimited skill cap: When you get better, there is always someone who is better that you in something. Placement, intuition, aiming, luck, awareness. and etc. Everthing has some room to get better and better as you try out the game.  7. Free: A big, no huge advantage over anything. Just try out the game, understand the mechanics and go forward. If you don't like it you can safely drop it. No problem at all.  8.   I'll add onto the list I can think of in the future, but definately. If I only could play one FPS in my life it would be TF2. Yes I date to say even over Overwatch which in June 19, 2016 is a marching giant over anything."
7.8/10 too much water (not to mention cancer community)
"One of the best games I ever played THIS IS A AMAZING game everything is great, but the updates aren't so frequent but other than that it's all good. I would recommend getting this game, AND THE BEST PART FREEDOM free to play, (but it is fun being a pay to play :p)"
Cool ! I like this game because its FPS and have offline mode !
"Amazing game. Made the class based shooter relevant, leading to games like Overwatch. It's been given a little more attention recently from valve, especially the competetive scene, causing this game to evolve and stay relevant even now. Theres so many ways to play this game. Trade, surf, play as a spy crab, pub stomp, try hard in match making, join a competetive division in ESEA or UGC in 4v4, 6v6, or 9v9. Try this game out, it has a lot of depth to it, even after 3000+ hours im still getting better and enjoying it.  +unique +team orientated +high skill ceiling +depth and strategy +play casually or competetively +free 2 play +not pay to win "

GReat Game
Great game.
"This game is hilarious, it is so much fun to play. But I do have to say the SHOP on TF2 is very bad dont use real money for the shop but if you want something you should start trading or buy from the market. And some of the updates are ♥♥♥♥ right now but overall it's by far the best fps iv'e ever played, im not even joking. this is a 10/10"
"- Brilliant base game, a refined team based shooter, one of the long standing multiplayer titles  - Supernatual longevity, with each class adding a different mode of play  - Has aquired complexity over time, maturing into a even deeper game   - Free as the birds!   - Most will complain about recent updates, issues with compeititive matchmaking  - Lack of proper tutorial makes for a unnesserary learning curve and confusion  Bottom line: Download it! Many years of fun to come yet!  "
It demostrates teamwork and all that good stuff. #RoekelApproved
awesome love this game 100/100
it makes me want to kill myself in a good way;)
BEST GAME IN THE F*CKIN WORLD!!!
This game has hats. Lots of hats. It should be named hat fortress market. There is a hat worth over $14000. No jokes.  This game is amazing. Buy all the hats.
Best FPS game I've ever played xD
Team fortress 2 was my first game on steam. It has always been my favorite game. in my oppinon it has a pretty good community. This game is super addicting. EVERY class is fun and unique there is no class i hate there all funny and play a great part in the game. So thats why its 10/10.
"great game, lot of fun because of the various playstyles and gamemodes"
Kids these days for life &lt;3 10/10 I was f2p in 2013 But today im p2p :D Damm i love my life when i was f2p :P 
"Teamfortress 2 is a mix of off the wall humor, giblets and an insane amount of fun. So lock and load and bring your friends, and remember above all else have fun =)  "
"Fun. Well made. Friends n Coop. Those things are the strong points of this game; Never gets old, TF2. With his basic gameplay, through years TF2 became a masterpiece of the Steam Community. Fresh new updates occasionally, fixin' some bugs and errors, adding some cosmetics n' taunts, weapons and unusuals. There's just a lil hitch. Autobalance. I'll be very glad if ya put on again. However, the game is well made, and I suggest to everyone to try it a least one in your life."
this game was absolutely amazing. i started off getting absolutely owned but eventually got better and now i am an accomplished player. PS. super addictive!
"This is the right path, trust me, follow me and you will have a life that has no life.  10/10"
"Team Fortress 2 is like a story about a great wonder child that eventually decended into a family whid two tired fathers. [The 2 Valve Employe's that update the game] Where the Game was feed nothing but the same thing over and over but had great friends that supported him [The TF2 Community] Only fore the two fathers too brush those friends away and tell that boy too become a accountant or some other office related employe.. while meanwhile the Game dreamed about Sky diving, Climbing mountains and vaste ambitions.. only too have those thoughts of 'Fun' slowly plucked away bit by bit by the two farthers that wanted the game grow up how they and only they wanted it.   Team Fortress 2 has had its Golden Age, Over and Over whid those Few Updates that sat the game on a Straight path fore improvement.. only fore the Developerteam too Undo their progress whenever they get unsure.   And this started even before the Meet your match ''Update'' .. that was just simply the final blow that plunged TF2 on a Road that it will have a hard time recovering from too be like it once was.   Despite being one of the most highly played Free games on steam its also one whid the most cheerishable memories from veterans that played it, a way too happily greet new people that has joined steam as most often its teh first game they get fore their library., all in all... Team Fortress 2 Still stands, its still alive, and far from 'Dead'.  But that is not too say its skipping joyfully. and carefree.. Team Forterss 2 Needs a change of developer Staff.  and at this point? seeing the latest Halloween update? the game is not ever going too progress towards another good update the way things are now.   Doing perhaps the same thing they did whid CS:GO where a seperate company creates updates and content as valve as proven they are incapable of this, They either do not have the time available too perform content, and thereby rush it too meet deadlines... So giving the control too others, while still keeping the brand? would only save this Old Wonderchild of a game. from the next 20 Stale Updates that bring !NOTHING! progressive or entertaining too the game.. So its time too cease looking at our game like some decaying cattles corpse.. and understand your very actions you have been taken fore the coming years.. Show some respect fore the game you put 9 years of development into, and the Community that is everyday playing it and just clinging too that hope that MAYBE.. just maybe.. We can open our eyes oneday and see the game some us has pledged 1000's? of hours, some even 5000 hours. OR BEYOND THAT be like how it was when things seemed too finally be going towards improvement. Its almost amazng the amount of dedication that some players or Veterans have towards Team Fortress, and its so sad too see the developers not take notice of the crowd they have cheering fore them too pump out refreshing idea's and content fore the players too enjoy.  Valve needs too do the same thing they did whid CS:GO, they need too grant the control of development over too someone or 'something' that has more time on its hand too care fore this game. and come up whid some new ideas.    So.. Too finish off all of this? I just had too get this off my chest, having watched so long at how this game had been doing that.. it was time too put in my opinion. a finishing quote?   ''Team Fortress 2 was great, and is still good, but lets not settle fore a bronze medal this time.'' -Another TF2 Veteran."
"Ok. Let me get this straight. This game is incredible from it's trading economy to competitive highlanders and even a game mode where you and your team verse a big strong man who goes by the name Saxton Hale. This game has absolutely everything. But don't forget it's amazing community with it's SFM animations and it's wacky Garry's Mod animations and thousands of pages of Fan Artwork. But did I mention the Hats? Yes, this name could infact go by the name Hat Simulator 2007. People go CRAZY for this special type of quality hat called an 'Unusual'. I unboxed my first yesterday and from a $2.49 Key, you get a $40 Hat. That is what strived me to write this rather long review for this Amazing Game. So, in the end, do I recommend it? HELL YES!"
"I love this game and its a great way for me to relieve some stress. i love every aspect of it. no matter how badly the game might do, it will allways be my game and ill allways love it and accept its flaws. theres no such thing as a perfect game. btw i LOVE my friend dots for showing me this amazing game, that has become my greatest source of inspiration. i do wish to mod this game one day - hopefully... and that i could be working closely with other tf2 ethusiasts to further mod the game that i so greatly admire. its also my favourite dress-up game XD  remember as it is right now only 5 people work on the ♥♥♥♥in game ... come on they need some help D:"

"This game lets you have a picnic, and if someone try's to ruin it you can mow them down with a minigun. 11/10"
Gaben can we have new weapons please? Please?
i still play it after almost three years so yeah its pretty good m8  better than overwatch
"Game has hats , me like hats ,me buy hats, me cry for buying to many hats, me buy more hats. Welcome to hat fortress 2. Thats right theres no team theres only that one pyro and soldier who rekt everything."
My 2nd Favorite game is tf2 i like this game so much good job valve
"Perfect FirstPersonShooter game for me.Good graphics,animations and a lot of diffrent weapons, hat and skins.This game is just perfect to play with diffrent class category"
"Mate, If a free to play game has the ability to make you spend a disgusting amount of your steam balance for a 40 dollar virtual hat and a 50 dollar golden reskin of stock weapons, it must be alright to say the least.."
"After 700+ hours, it's still a huge fun any time, as it constantly adds something new, and there's a multitude of maps and game modes. Greatly recommended:)"
Yeah its pretty alright i guess
This is by far the best free game on the market.  Its been out since 2007 and its STILL amazing! 10/10 hands down
"This game is good as a first person shooter. Trading is terrible now, let me explain.   The hats are getting crappier every day and the trading community is falling apart over escrow. Valve has had a history of abusing the trading, competitive, and casual communities over and over. They're becoming more like Microsoft every day.  Let me explain Valve's logic behind Escrow: +Fewer instances of hacked accounts and stolen items (for the next year or so) +Fewer steam support tickets they have to deal with (for the next year or so) +(see previous 2) Steam will be rated one of the most secure social networking platforms (for the next year or so)  Now let me explain the problems with Escrow: -Crumbling of trading society, regular trading becomes impossible for anyone without a phone that can run the software -Lower net income for Valve (Trading community BUYS KEYS AND ITEMS FROM VALVE) -Fewer active spenders on Steam (People will abandon steam) -Lower trust in Valve by community -Death of the Competitive community as people can no longer flash expensive guns, hats, and knives and have it be impressive. Yes, this is one of the reasons people comp this game. I'm serious. -Since every account must now be secured via the mobile app to trade, Every hacker will be working to break it, resulting in... -Lower security options for everyone, and fewer cards in Valve's hands to fight hackers"
"I am going to keep this review short. Team Fortress 2 was the first game I played on steam and was the reason why I joined the platform in the first place. It is the reason why I am able to enjoy all these other games because without it I may have never joined Steam and while it is certainly at a low-point right now, it is still a fun, free, team-based shooter and has been for 9 years now."

I really well detailed FFS. I had started thinking that this was a dumb game. Seeing that it is cartoonish. As I played day after day I got really into playing it. It had 9 diffrent unique classes. Loads of diffrent maps and most of all COSMETICS... Cosmetics really make each diffrent players unqiue as to their diffrent cosmetic sets. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to play FFS.

"Team Fortress 2. It's a great classic Valve game. The community is starting to die out, you can still play games but they will have a extra 30 second wait unlike a while ago, even if you select all the gamemodes with all the maps, I tried doing tests at different times before posting this on different days. I found simular results. Not as fun as used to be, bad updates plus overwatch coming out really killed more than 65% of the players, not to mention that they got bored or older(college). The game itself used to cost 60 dollars but that slowly died down just like the community is, as the pricers got lower and lower, the game became more of a pay to play game. Once the game became completely free, the game was filled with paid items that you would need to buy to win. The game used to be really fun, recent updates kinda ruined it. Competitive is a waste of time, I have multiple friends with 1,500 hours on this game and they are level one for competititve, probably because of how bad the whole thing is. Matchmaking itself is also really buggy, I have been put with one person before vs twelve other people that were like level 90+. The main reason I still play is because of how funny the characters are, the MVM co-op mode(great with friends) , and also community servers. Otherwise I would never played continued to play this game weekly, rather monthly instead. 5/10, Vavle you failed me, I used to love this game, I can't say the same 3 years later."

Revolutionary no lifeing help
"I feel like every year I need to come back and review this game, just because my opinion shifts, as does the community's. People talk about how TF2 is dead, and they're wrong. The community is still very much alive, but the game has been around for 8 years now and is of course past it's prime. The game is still really fun, and you can very easily pick up and play; things are really well balanced and intuitive.  Valve has been slacking on updates for this game, the last major update which we recieved, the end of the line update, (an overhyped, community update to go along with a short SFM film) turned out to be a trainwreck, with a release that disappointed us with pretty much everything. The core problem people like me have with the updates currently being shipped for this game is that they add nothing new in terms of gameplay, just cosmetics. Luckily, recently Valve decided to start up a map workshop, which could be just what valve was looking for to keep gameplay fresh for veteran players.  So next up is competitive matchmaking. That'll be fun to see."
"While I can only take about 1-2 hours at a time before I detach from reality with all of the comic-like graphics, this is a wildly popular free to play game for all ages. You have nothing to loose (money wise) by checking out this free whacky game!"
"TF2. A game where u can play with friends or VS other people from around the world in a 12 v 12 match. (Unless its modded) U can earn items by playing,buying from market or store.   &gt;&gt;^_^&lt;&lt;"
"Where oh where do I start? Hm.. Ok! TF2 is an action online game where players take on the important roles of choosing the best class for the team. No? Not it? Well, ♥♥♥♥ it! TF2 is a fun source game created by Valve. It has cartoon-ish graphics and fun gameplay mechanics.  Are you bored of the standard, day-to-day gamemodes? Well then, your in for a treat! TF2 has a variety of gamemodes that will keep you entertained. No? You get bored of the game modes? Well then! Go onto community hosted servers to do all sorts of cool stuff! Do whatever your heart desires.  Users will have 'classes' that they can pick at the start of every game. Or change it when they die. But.. all the classes are fun, my favorite is the Spy class, you know go invisible and stabby stab stab! You have a great variety of classes to choose from, each unique and fun to play with.  Now, this game isn't competetive, nor' should it be. It's about having fun, losing, winning, gaining ♥♥♥♥. You can also trade and buy stuff.  This game isn't all 'F2P' meaning you can buy stuff from the marketplace.. But everything else is 100% free!  Hats? Hats? HATS! So many ♥♥♥♥ing hats and cosmetics you will be unique and never worry about the same person with your swagger. *♥♥♥♥♥ i'm fabulous*   Want a fantasy flamethrower that shoots out rainbow stuff?! You can have it! My life-long dream!! Also many other guns that can be OP, but are usually not. :P  The community is fine, some jackasses here and there, but mostly fine. And that's what truley makes this game as fun as it is!  I don't generally play this game, but I might start getting back into it!  Uhh....   Hm..  Oh yeah!  The end!"
great game
Not too bad. Can't expect much out of a free dancing simulator.
Killed a minigun-wielding Russian with a fish.  10/10
Very fun and addicting F2P game with a nice business model.
It ruined my life 
"Tbh, after playing this game for a while, I find it to be ♥♥♥♥, I still love it, but the problems i've discovered during my time playing has made it an unexjoyable experience at times  If valve actually put time into it like they did in CS:go, it would be a whole new story  The following list describes my complaints about the current version  1. Hitboxes, seriously valve, you're gonna stick a couple of rectangles in the models and classify that as the hitscan/melee wep hitbox?, there are so many gaps between the rectangles and so far, the only thing I've seen you patch was the engie's invincible ♥♥♥♥. Also, why the ♥♥♥♥ is the projectile hitbox a giant ♥♥♥ rectangle? It doesn't even rotate with the player axis, and creates so much fake reg for splash abuse weps.  2. Hitreg, might be me, might not be me, but according to 'hitscan', when i click on someone, it should be a instant, perfect registration, but i'm forced to preaim with hitscan weapons in order to recieve any registration at all.  3. The flamethrower, this weapon is abused by many who can't be bothered to learn how to aim properly, I'm not concerned about the lack of skill it takes to use the primary fire function, but its the hit range of the primary attack function that gets me worked up, the hit range exceedes the particle effect in place to reperesent the hit range, so why have the particle effect there if it means absolute ballocks  4. Huntsman, looks like you amplified the hitboxes by whatever multipler you chose when this weapon is active  5. Splash-damage based weapons, again, this is something similar to the flamethrower, the actual splash range also exceeds the particle effect generated, it might also be beacuse of your ridiculous projectile hitboxes.  6. Spy backstab range, so you're saying that stabbing someone in the arm counts as an insta kill?, great logic there, also, this relates back to my first complaint, the hitbox lags behind, so even if i turn to face the spy, i still get stabbed, great.  Overall, this game had potential, but was butt♥♥♥♥ed but broken ♥♥♥ mechanics that no-one bothered to fix"
"Now I don't know how on earth you got from TFC (Team Fortress Classic) to this, I mean it's in no way similar, but I LOVE IT. It's bloody amazing! The style of it and the unique things you can get on the market for a cheap price. Yeah, you find things for free but have to pay for something else to make full use of it, but it's still good. If you search the market, you can get it cheaper anyway. (Still waiting to find a Mann. Co Crate Key for the Limited Summer Crates, haven't the money to buy it.)  I call this game GOTY every year, because it is just untoppable. Brilliant work, Valve! Keep updating this game with amazing ideas and I'll be passing it down generation to generation."
"This game is amazing, even for its age, its way better than most nowadays. Its F2P, but its NOT a P2W, the only thing you can buy is cosmetics, taunts, skins...nothing that impact the gameplay Of course, if you have cosmetics, you will be kinda...Intimidating, and this will help you more than you think. It may be kinda tough to get used to all the mechanics, takes time to get, at least, good(i'll get there), but it is worth it  Now the horrible, horrible downside The community. how can i say it? It's a cancer, and it is getting worst and worst every minute, it spread like a desease. Sometimes you catch yourself acting like that, and its a shame to see such great game, getting killed by those pests. Yeah, you will find friendly players, of course, but its like seeing a unicorn in hell.  So, if you like chaos, seeing unicorns in hell, guns and explosions what are you waiting for? Why are you still reading this? Go install the game ffs  [Sorry for the bad english]"
"Great game, can provide you with 100s of hours of fun. 10/10 ign"
"Meh could be better, didn't play it very much."
I love trading on this game because I meet new friends nearly every game. :)
"Team Fortress 2 is a First - Person Shooter that millions of people have played. You can customize yourself with hats, shirts, weapons and so on. Although you have to pay real world money for hats or trade. If you are Free - to - Play, don't bother the insults Premiums throw at you. You're here just to have fun, right? Well, who am I kidding. Why recommend this game when you should have already gotten it? Score: 10/10 stars. Although once you had your fill of fun, you have to play other games otherwise TF2 will soon get boring."
traded my unusual sammy cap for a ghostly gibbus with pink paint. 10/10 profit
"I honestly feel with the gunmetal update that things have dimmed down from skill and into looks. I cannot go to someone with an unusual weapon and think 'Oh that guy played a lot longer than me, he should be considered a reasonable threat' because I find the majority to just being posing and doing raffles and putting lots of money into the game for keys and the such to trade for them. It's ridiculous. Regardless, the game IS still fun to play, but has lost that trading and hats charm. I hope that gets revived someday."
Great game one of the best F2P games ever
It doesent mater if you are naked the only thing matter is the hat
:))
Satisfying things in TF2: Getting a new hat Ubercharging someone Backstabbing someone and getting away with it Choppin' heads with the eyelander Having a strange item reach a new quality Dominating a gibus noob  more 2 come
"This game is amazing. All weapons have balancing effects, so old players don't have a massive advantage over new ones. Sidegrades, not upgrades. The different classes are set up in a way that keeps any one class from dominating the game, since every class had a counter. The countless weapons and 9 classes alow for peerless customization of your playstyle. This is like the only game ever with no capability for PTW, since every weapon can be found, except for some reskins. Large amounts of the game's content come from the community, which is amazing in and of itself. The detail is amazing, and everything looks amazing, even on the lowest settings. The holiday events are loads of fun. I could go on for hours, but lets face it, long reviews are boring! Recommend 10/10.  Update: To people b!tching about the MYM update, stop it. The game still rocks, the main menu just got a little worse."
Great Game. 10/10. Get it. Now.  Edit: Meet Your Match Update 6/10. Get it if you want.
"A classic. Was worth $20, and is definitely worth $free"
This game is super fun. I reccomend it for people who want to have a good time for free&gt;  Edit: Still a great game a year later. When I'm bored on the weekends I'll jump into game and I know I'm going to have a lot of fun.
What can I say that hasn't been said about TF2? I've had more fun dying in this game than any other FPS!
"Uncomprehensively an amazing game! Gameplay takes a while to get used too, i.e. Rocket jumping, the game is generally unique providing funny and unrealistic physics that everyone just gets used too!  The game provides so much ways of playing it, so its not all about being a tryhard and killing EVERYONE in plain sight. The TF2 community offers amazing CUSTOM gamemodes like: - VS Saxton Hale - Deathrun - Smash Fortress - Pubs - and MANY more!  Though its not just the community that makes this game awesome, its the game itself and the Developers (Praise Robin Walker!) who makes this game so enjoyable! The game is nicely frequently updated with bug fixes, amazing content like updates including new weapons, balance changes and MOST Importantly... Hats, whats TF2 without them!?  This game is for both casual people who just enjoy a more relaxed FPS featuring taunts, by taunts that are so unique you can sit down on a lovely chair with an umbrella having a nice sip of beer, or become epic sax guy with a.. you guessed it! A saxophone!  Team Fortress 2 in basic is a team based First Person Shooter, that features 9 classes, so you have your pick on which one you prefer.  They are in order -Scout (Offensive Class) -Soldier (Offensive Class) -Pyro (Offensive Class) -Demoman (Defensive Class) -Heavy (Most Iconic Russian, Defensive Class) -Engineer (Defensive Class) -Medic (Support Class) -Sniper (Support Class) -Spy (Support Class)  Thats a large class selection that gently suits everyones type of playstyle! and the game has got no 'Pay to Win' feel, you can get weapon drops just by playing the game! but you can always pay a bit of money if you feel the need to enhance your experience of the game.  Overall TF2 is a VERY addictive, fun, more laidback FPS that provides competitive and casual gameplay and provides one of the most unique gameplay and experiences out there in the gaming industry!  So what are you waiting for? Hop right in to the fun! I highly recommend this game for anyone, Competitive player or not. The only downside is, is for those who HATE the unique Cartoony graphics, I know some like to see a lot of gore, but you can stick to other games for that. Asides from that... its the best and only class warfare based hat simulator."
"This game is Free to Play, and it's a Valve FPS Game. That should really be enough to explain why you should get this game."
"good game, Definetly deserves the 'test of time' award, as even though I get into more and more games, I find myself playing this game to pass the time or just do some silly stuff."
Nominated this game for best use of farm animal. Cow Cardboard Cutout 10/10
This Game Sucks 10/10
"Good game with 9 classes that are cheap in their own way. Choose whichever suits your playstyle best :3 One thing to keep in mind while playing, gibus is too OP and needs nerf. Wait a minute... Gibus begins with G. G is 7th letter of the alphabet. The word team in Team Fortress 2 has 4 letters. 7-4=3 HALF-LIFE 3 CONFIRMED"

this game is cool :)
It's still pretty amazing to think that TF2 came out almost 10 years ago.
Great game! Very fun to play the game with friends! The October events are fun to take on different bosses and interact with other players across the world
"Install it, Play it, Love it !  This game is different than any other FPS which i'v seen.  This game will never get boring."
10/10
I just love wasting my hard earned money on this magnificent hat simulator and so will you if you get this game.
"I just realized that I have played this game for more than 1K hours and haven't made a recommendation for it so here I am. When I tried this game (first time), the voice of the 'announcer' was so strange I said 'I won't be able to tolerate this voice' so I stopped playing basically right after I started. After like, a year maybe I picketed it up again, thanks to 'GameDay Iroda'. I thought 'why not try it again' and boy, after few hours of struggling with... well any class I fell in love. I wasted few hundred bucks on virtual items since then but you know, I don't mind it. This game gave me so many awesome hours and I still like it, I don't know when it will wear off but one thing is for sure: if you haven't played it already just give it a shot (You can't lose anything since it's F2P)."
Addictive and pulls money from my wallet. Needs more hats and hats.
Collect hats to make better hats to buy better hats to make yourself better than people with less better hats. And has a bunch of FPS non hat bull you don't care about.
Great game with personality plus it never gets boring. :spycon:
Thanks for crits Gabe
"One of first games I played on steam. After all these years, still appeals me. I love how community has grow with the game, still has many years to go.  Long life to TF2!"

A very fun game i played since i downloaded it on steam and its also f2p
"If you're new to the game you're going to love it, maybe not so much after 1,700 hours and how valve ♥♥♥♥♥ on it"
"Played for a bit, wore some hats, made some friends. 4,000 hours later still loving it 10/10"
"RIP, but the every RIP replaced with fun"
Game of fun and excietment! Good to play with friends!!
"It is like alchemy in a way when you try certain things but more often than not they turn out horribly and you've blown off part of your psyche trying to do what you think is correct. Soon in time it will all come together. Trial and error. Once you have mastered the elements that control the land, rocketjumping, strafing, breaking your wrist in half from flick-shooting, binding M1 to also spam lennyfaces in the chat.   You know many combinations and calculated all the results that can happen. Hats, Wealth, killstreaks, My name jeff. You have it all.   You are ready to ascend to the next level of creation. Platnium scout main. Yet you start to keep going. Climbing. Getting better and better. Then you realize in your own pursuit of divine creation. You are alone. You have pushed down many to get to the point you are at now. All that is left is your supreme skill and knowledge of this reality..But no one to share it with.      TL;DR"
"     Pros(+)   Cons(-)     +Awesome art style.   -Eats all of my money. ಠ_ಠ     +Is very fun to play with friends.   -Has haters and screaming kids like all online games.    +Has items and hats and so many different options on how to play the game, beacuse of it's huge weapon selection  -The new updates and the fact that there is no public matches anymore kinda ruined the game.    "
"Hey, it's pretty good!"
Great game
cool rolebased teamwork game
"Always fun to play, no matter what. I love to play this game. The many classes allow such diverse gameplay and adds a lot of replayability. This game is old and the fact that there are still so many people playing it is a testament to just how good it is."
The kind of people you will find when you play:  -8 Year olds who scream into the mic xD -Hackers -WM1 Spammers (You will know what i mean when you play as a pyro) -And great players  10/10 Actually a really fun game!
Valve ruined this game
"[IS GOOD GAME SPEND MONEY ON IT TO SUPORT GAEBN] &lt;old review text | I haven't played in a while, but I enjoyed every single minute, even set aside the (initially buggy) competitive update. You don't necessarily need to spend money on the game to be good, by the way. However, you will eventually run out of backpack space on your free account. To get 5 more pages all you have to do is buy a 50 cent item from the Mann Co. Store (yes, you don't need to buy a backpack expander at first. Later if you need more pages you will, though). Also, I'd give the game a try before giving into people's opinionation and taking sides on whether or not the devs neglect the game."
One of the best games I have ever played. Plus its Free now.

"After 9 years of development and 9 more years of public access:  Cons:    Code is spaghetti from the lots of updates    Item schema is inconsistent    Practically used as a milking cow, (seemingly) barely getting any attention from Volvo    Every newer update comes broken    Close to collapse in-game economy    Compared the long living community made competitive, the official one is rather weak (especially since it was also Valve who made CS:GO's and Dota's)    Despite the yearly two balance (attempting) patches, some weapons are just completely forgotten    Not ported to Source 2 engine   Pros:    Runs on Windows, Linux and Mac    It's glory days may be over, but still rocks with an active community and playerbase    Free to Play    ♥♥♥♥ton of community servers, occasionally even with mods    Several different gamemodes    We can select the map(s) we want to play on    Easy and free to host our own dedicated servers with  SteamCMD    Despite all that crap, I still like this game"
"A community-based game is like being with a girl; Once you stop listening to what they want, they'll probably find another guy that actually listens to them. The game went from 'Stout Shako for 2 refined' to neo-economic ways to make quick money. Safe to say that most of the community is disappointed of what it has become."
The best team shooter until recently when Valve forgot it existed and Blizzard relized they could do it better. Still fun for a free romp.
Pretty Great
Well there goes my money and time... Well totaly worth it!  if we dont count in the new server find thingy its still as good as ever. Just bring back the old server finder. Now theres no more 1v1 me bro moments whit my friends. You removed a huge part of the experiense.. Plz valve bring back the old server finder.. im begging you
"Well, So far this game has gone a long way with it's ups and downs, but its very enjoyable at times. It's a very god game for me (atleast for a person that played it for 2 years) Its great. While it's updates bring a down fall, I still like it. I won't leave this game for a long time, atleast till im married. Im glad I got to know this game and it brought me a long way. This game will always be enjoyable."
"Team Fortress 2 is probably the best in class-based shooters. With constant updates and tweaks, the game keeps evolving, but the experience stays the same. Not having a copy is probably a sin, considering how cheap and well-maintained it is."
"Team Fortress 2 is probably the best free 2 play game on steam, combining 9 fun and different characters with a ton of maps, game-modes and cosmetics. I highly reccomend trying it out"
"There aren't too many games that have withstood a decade, and still provides exciting updates throughout. From the originial Orange Box release, to the now free-to-play transition, Team Fortress 2 is a must have."
"Hmm what can I say. 'Scotland is not a real country, you are an Englishman with a dress!' -soldier"

"Most call it hat simulator, some call it a F2P joke. I tend to call it one of the better FPS games I have ever played, I sunk in 1,008 hours into it and I honestly have not gotten tired of it in the slightest. As of late the Valve team for TF2 has been neglecting it to a ludicrous extent with very poor gameplay changes and the removal of quickplay and the addition of competitive play. I feel that the Valve team lost a good amount of people to this as TF2 is not a competitive style game, it may be for some but quickplay was where you would find the friendly F2P players who need a nudge in the right direction to find the class that fits them the best. They removed that aspect and it makes the game purely competitive and any new player coming in will not see TF2 the way it was around a year ago and I am saddened by that fact.  Hopefully the Valve team will wake up and see that TF2 isnt a game made purely for competitive players, but the casual and even noobish players and need to return the the simple formula it once used as it's basis for a game that has withstood the test of time; 9 years.  In any case I feel the game is still something that can be polished up, but it is still a game with trying because of the people you meet."
"I may not be great, I may not even be good, but this game certainly is."
"Cheaters are killing this game and Valve does nothing about it, I've complained many times already, yet nothing has been done, so I quit it.  Guys, don't waste your time playing a game full of cheaters. Great game, poor management."
"tf2 was better back in 2012-14 those good times, now its Team of duty moderm fortress 2, i've stick with community servers for now on."
"I used to love this game, but after that one update that ruined everything in regards to matchmaking etc, I rarely play it.  When I do, I run into at least one hacker in every game.  Not sure what happened, there used to rarely ever be hackers in TF2. I think the introduction of having ranks made people more determined to hack and rank up, whereas before, there were no ranks and thus hardly any incentive to hack.  R.I.P."
"(This review is a rewrite of my old one, which was far less serious)  Team Fortress 2, even after over 8 years since its release, remains one of Steam's most played games. TF2 has exciting FPS gameplay, 9 classes that all feel different from one another, and it feels incredibly smooth to control your character and shoot people. Each class has unlockable weapons, which are (mostly) side-grades to the stock. The game has several bright, well-designed, and interesting maps to play on. This game still hasn't gotten old for me, because there's so much stuff to learn and do. Even after getting the hang of all the classes, you can still learn about things like sentry jumps, trimping, and entering the reference pose to screw with people. This is because so many people have played the game and discovered new mechanics over the years.  Team Fortress 2 also has an amazing free-to-play model. Every single map, weapon, class, and mechanic is available to everybody for free. All things you are required to invest money in are completely cosmetic, mostly hats and weapon reskins.  The TF2 community can be rather toxic at times. People often do things like spam memes and bully new players, even if they themselves are relatively new. Nice players are still playing this game though. I run into players who are good sports and display kind manners toward their opponents and new players.  Not everything is completely balanced in TF2, either. Some weapons and weapon combos can be unfair to fight against, but every once in a while Valve steps in and fixes these things. Speaking of which, Valve has been helping the game out a lot recently, with bug fixes, balance changes, a new competetive mode (not perfect but in the making), and cosmetic updates. I have a lot of hope for the future of TF2 and its community, and I invite anyone who wants to play a good shooter game to join us."
"As someone who paid for the game back in 2009 and saw the game becoming a Free To Play, I can state that this game is still a classic in the FPS genre. There's a reason why many games are trying to have a take in the style it brought but nothing puts down the king, the classic, the pillar of the heavily class-based FPS. The first one was a great Half-Life stand-alone mod. This is the real deal though.  Even though I stopped playing TF2 a long while ago, it doesn't change the fact that it's always a blast to play. With so many games to play, it's not because this is a bad game that I stopped playing. It's just the way I roll.  TF2 is fair but vicious, fun and viceral. Gore and absolutely old-school but far from being archaic. Many people will consider some aspects of this game as archaic when in fact it's just balanced.  Ithas been thought, developped and made to be this way.  The classes are diversified and can all be mastered to a professional level, while being easy and fun to get into right off the bat. you can change classes in game so it is always possible to try different classes and to adjust the highs and lows of your team compared to the other team.   May it be the Scout, the Spy, the Sniper, the Pyro, the Heavy, the Engineer, the Demoman, the Soldier or the Medic, every classes is interesting to play and have their utility on the field.  With the Source Engine being open-source and the Steam Workshop, this game can thrive until the dawn of Steam, and even then, it wouldn't stop people from modding it off of Steam, just like every other Valve games.  A classic amongst the classics/10"
"Amazing game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ people"
"This game still holds up, trading is awesome, and you can actually earn money by selling your drops...Overwatch is ok, but still hasnt been where TF2 has..Tf2 has stood the test of time!"
Trading Fortress 2
This game will never die 10/10 need more taunts

I want to keep playing TF2, but the community and the incompetent developers give me no choice."
One of the most funniest game I ever played. Really recommend it.
"After a few years, some games usually fade away against the test of time.  This is not one of those games."
mmm. it's alright
"Yes. Medic! Medic! Spy! medic! Anyways, i strongly reccomend anyone who gets this game to buy a single item off of the mann co store."
Started as a F2P noob yelling at people for hacking while they`re not even hacking  Looking at me today...  I haven`t changed a bit  well im a P2P now
Random crits are better than ultimates.
"Pros:  Funny characters  Unique style and graphics  Well optimised  Fun gameplay with a large variety of different classes Hackers are very rare (on VAC secured servers)  Nice community  Wide variety of gamemodes and maps Free to play   Cons:   Meet your match update is terrible, it's gotten better but it's still pretty bad Community is starting to shrink   Conclusion: Good game"

Its a classic...  an amazing classic
the sniper character has a tash as if he was a registered sex offender
"Hi i have played this game for 922 hours and this is the best game in the world. Cs go is 1/10 TF2 is 10/10. We have more effects in tf2 like air shot, stair stab and head shot in air. You have many types of games and funny to play with friends!  i recommend this game for   10/10"
"This game is great!there can be tons of players playing at the same time and its a great friend making game with robot fighting co-op.If u dont have this game,get it ASAP!"
It's a great game with horrible optimization.
Loving this game
i recommend playing for epic gameplay if you record you are good
This is without a doubt the world's #1 war-themed hat simulator!
10/10 Great Game
What's not to love about this game?
The Game has taken nearly 2500 hours of my sad life and turned me into a furry. ten/10
You can set ♥♥♥♥ on ♥♥♥♥ing FIRE. What the hell else do you want?
Very good game for its price.

Capped point by hiding in a cardboard box   11/10 woukd snake again 
"It's a game where you shoot each other in the face, say insulting one-liners, and if you're feeling silly, you can bash people's heads in with a frying pan, a cardboard tube or a fish."
the best game to play with your friends and to may enemies.
Where's the updates
"I probably spent over £300 on this game all for cosmetics, stranges etc. The game is fun except I don't really think there needs to be casual and competitive. Yes I'm fine with levels, but Team Fortress 2 has never been competitive. It's always been normal and fun. Competitive is just CS:GO's rank and time limit put into Team Fortress 2.  The community servers are fun with lots of different gamemodes to choose from such as 'Slender Fortress' or 'Sniper Wars'. I have never come across a child admin who abuses and I think these community servers are okay. Although, I have a problem about these servers. The overuse of the lenny face meme. There are people who are russian or who use the MLG meme so much it feels like it's just a overused dead meme. Most of these people have doge steam profile pictures...  Overall, I think Team Fortress 2 is one of the best games out there for free to play. The only cons are that there are constantly hats being added and on average everyone in the game buys hats. We also haven't had a new weapon for about a year now. Could Valve improve in the Jungle update?"
"Excellent game. I love the simple, textures that are THICK and smooth. The blocky fingers and it's imperfection is what makes the art so creative and fun. The voice actors come from a wide range of countries too."
its okay i guess
the best fps multiplayer ever created
the best game to play with your friends and to may enemies.
Where's the updates
"I probably spent over £300 on this game all for cosmetics, stranges etc. The game is fun except I don't really think there needs to be casual and competitive. Yes I'm fine with levels, but Team Fortress 2 has never been competitive. It's always been normal and fun. Competitive is just CS:GO's rank and time limit put into Team Fortress 2.  The community servers are fun with lots of different gamemodes to choose from such as 'Slender Fortress' or 'Sniper Wars'. I have never come across a child admin who abuses and I think these community servers are okay. Although, I have a problem about these servers. The overuse of the lenny face meme. There are people who are russian or who use the MLG meme so much it feels like it's just a overused dead meme. Most of these people have doge steam profile pictures...  Overall, I think Team Fortress 2 is one of the best games out there for free to play. The only cons are that there are constantly hats being added and on average everyone in the game buys hats. We also haven't had a new weapon for about a year now. Could Valve improve in the Jungle update?"

Decent game...I did not play it much.
So! Listen up cupcakes! Do you want to be good at this game ? (if you dont go duck yourself!) The thing of becoming good at this game is time! you need to play this game a lot if you want to be good ^^  (Buying hats helps too ^^)
Best Games Forever :3   i like this guy   100% recommenend =D
"Although, the new matchmaking system isn't perfect, It's sure as hell effective. I personally think that TF2 isn't dead, and belive that those who keep spewing it should reconsider their actions. The game still lives, folks."
You are missing alot of fun if you are not playing this game.
team fortress 2 is my favorite game
"I played a little bit, it's good."
Good Game Hate the players
Is a good meme
Capped point by hiding in a cardboard box   11/10 woukd snake again 
"It's a game where you shoot each other in the face, say insulting one-liners, and if you're feeling silly, you can bash people's heads in with a frying pan, a cardboard tube or a fish."

TF2 is one of the best game in the world
This game ruined my life
"One of the best FPS games I have ever played, every round is a new experience and this game will always be fascinating no matter how old it gets."
This game has a very fun and creative gameplay style to it that makes you want to play your heart out.
It has hats!
"I dont think that there is any question that this is one of the top rated games available on steam and i can see why. Hours upon hours of just using its multiplayer settings to hide from your friends in prop hunt, destryo some robots in MVM, or go all out capturing the flag and control points in multiplayer. Highly recommend. Despite some very questionable updates and the community belief that Valve just dont really care about this game anymore, after so many years I still find myself popping into a quick match and having some fun. The layout and feel of the game may have changed. But community servers keep the spirit alive."
Most addictive game i've ever played and probably the best one.
"Really fun game, lets you do whatever you want and customize the classes as many time as you want to."
its free     also hats
"played for a few hours, not too bad. the construction worker class is pretty cool"
"When it's possible to be a sexy space viking medic, anything's possible. Surely?"
Nice trading simulator   oh there is a shooter mini-game btw
10/10 ruined my life
"As much as it may be more of a Hat Simulator now, I still love this game. I've met plenty of great people on it, and I've always enjoyed the gameplay.   Sure the hit boxes can be pretty crappy at times, and you get those tryhard competitive people on here and there, but as long as you have fun all those little flaws just don't matter. This game is quite a lot of fun to play, and even more so with friends. The goofy cartoony style is what really makes this game unique. Even more with those characters, which all have such different personalities and traits to them, it just makes the game even more fun!  As much as I hope this game will live on, I doubt it will tho. Unless they fix the bigger issues, but they'd have to update a lot for that...but I'm sure the community will stay. It has a lot of amazing people, and very talented ones too. From SFM-Gmod videos to amazing Artworks on DeviantArt and whatnot, there are fans all around the globe.  Over all, it may still have broken parts and need a lot of fixing, and there may be lots of idiots/jerks playing this game, but I still love it. And I think I always will. It's just too great. C:"
this game is awesome becaiuse it hag creative weapons and exsesaries for each charactor 
Fought with Blu people on 2Fort and then went home to play TF2 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"This game is just a masterpiece! It has everything to crafting, to shooting! Sure it will cost you 5 dollars for premium but it is worth it!"
Love every min of this game.....if you haven't play this game I feel sorry for you...!!! This game has survived for over 10 years and we are still going stong   Vote this game for the steam Awards  Do your part
"Team Fortress 2 Is one of the best multiplayer shooters out to this date, It may be because it's had so long to mature as a game, and balance out it classes and weapons, But even then, I can still pick it up today and have a blast."
"This game has ruined me and needs more hats and weapons. 10/10 would ruin my life again.  New updates? More like, new exploits."
"It Is Very Cool, But Very Complex And Hard Based On The Facts That Have Very Much Tryhards And Spawnkillers And Just Plain Hackers And Experienced People."
The most fun you can have online....
Two games in one - Team Fortress 2 + Hat Simulator
"A game that I keep coming back to, it has really stood the test of time and hopefully valve will keep updating it to keep us hooked."
"I remember when I when I first got this game back in August of 2014. It was good then, and it's good now. Sure, it has some flaws, but you can't avoid that, can you?"
Good but it just aint what it used to be

"Haven't played much, it's ok"
This game was released 9 years ago. Still worthy of playing. &gt;:3c
hey yep. I recommend Team Fortress 2 for all your Team Fortress 2 needs.
"R.I.P in peace, old friend."
best game although im taking a break from it
"Originally the greatest team-based first person shooter available to buy, Team Fortress 2 has become increasingly distant from its clean and professional roots. The game remains an enjoyable shooter where teamwork and coordination trump individual skill, but its cohesive art style and balanced gameplay have been set aside.  Artistic quality and cohesion have been overtaken by flash and marketing tie-ins. Basically cosmetic items have become more important than the game being clean and easy to navigate.  Gameplay balance has been upset by the introduction of new weapons which out perform the default ones, additionally the classes have somewhat lost track of their original purposes, Demoknights being the worse offender of that trend.  Still a great game, and even free now. There is no downside to playing, but I question the value of buying anything from the store in order to get a premium account."
  100000000000000000000000000000/10. Would and have recommended to all my friends because it's awesome
"A fun, balanced shooter game. Very fun and can get interesting. YOU HAD BETTER BUY A HAT OR YOU WILL BE HATED BY EVERY PLAYER IN THIS GAME! This game should be nominated for the test of time award it is still good!"
Wow what do i say about this game. Tell me one other game you get to shoot a rocket at you're feet propell yourself on to roof hitting someone in the head with your shovel while wearing a decerative christmas uniform and on your head there is a hat thats on fire! now think about that and all you need is about 500$ for the hat and the abitlity to click on install this game STRONGLY Reccommend Friednly to noobs (w+m1) and pros. :) 10/10
kinda like Overwatch but with different weapons and characters2
"Team Fortress 2, most commonly known as 'TF2', is a pretty good game. It has tons of weapons you can choose from and 9 different classes with their own unique skills and personality. There are also tons of different gamemodes to select. But the one thing you need to survive at all in the cancerous community, are hats (Yes, people judge you by your hats).  Pros: +Various weapons +9 different classes +Tons of different gamemodes +Replayability +Pootis +Hats  Cons: -Most of the community -Random crits -Hats  Overall, this game for me is pretty awesome. I played it a ton, as you can tell, and will keep playing it until the end.  Update:This game should win the 'Test of time' award because it's nearly 10 yhears old and is still going quite strong for it's age"
"I thought spending money on a game is ridiculous but here I am buying a lot of sht so that my characters can look cool in game. Haha. Help me.    Anyway,  I haven't been playing this game for too long; I'm just about 300 hours in. But this game has been an absolute fun to me. Some would say that that is precisely because I'm still new to the game, but I'm the kind of person that gets bored really easily ( really ), so 300 hours is kind of big for me.  This game has it all. The characters are really interesting. That's actually why I started playing the game in the first place. I really like the art style. Some people get thrown off by the cartoony art, but that's just preferences. The mechanic is interesting; the class like the Spy isn't what you'd normally find in any other fps game. I like source engine. I like how the community is a really big part of this game; we get community cosmetics, items, maps; we have people doing all these cool projects like Mayann or Frontline and stuff. I like all the customization I can do with my characters; on how they look and on how they can be played. A demoknight is nothing like a sticky demo, a gunslinger engie isn't the same as a classic wrench engie. I like how I have choices on how to play the game. I can be a tryhard, or 360 no scope sniper, I can be a battle medic, or a pootis, or whatever. I can play on different gamemodes like Dodgeball, Medieval, or other stuffs.  The reason I'm writing this review is actually because I noticed lots of people using their alts to write negative reviews about the update. I know the update is a big disappointment for a lot of people. It has a ♥♥♥♥ ton of bugs and everything. And the hype was really intense and so this is a really hurt letdown. But the game getting ratings off alternate accounts isn't really fair for it :("
Fun game! I'm just doing this for the badge. Don't think I care about writing reviews.
"My grandfather used to smoke every day. He worked as a groundskeeper at a school and whenever he wasnt working, he would smoke. Eventually one day he gained cancer and he had to be taken to hospital. He didnt make it. I got told by my parents never to smoke, so i havent. He died 1 year before i was born. My grandfather died with less cancer than this game."

"Excellent command shooter. The lighting, the atmosphere, the interface - all at high. You were given 9 classes, each with its own history and character and most importantly - their customization to your taste. And if you're thinking - download or not download, I recommend the first option.  10/10"
"Really good game. Has the key parts to a great first-person shooter. Just some bugs here and there, and sometimes the view models are bad, but either way gret game. 8/10 in my opinion. One of my fav games."
"i just started playing this, but already i have like 30 items! definetely a must play, furthermore its free too! recommend to play with friends, more fun."
Da best of da best!
"Really enjoyable and addictive to play.  Up to 9 classes to choose from and with sub-classes to boot, it's the definition of an addictive FPS.   If you're looking to get started into playing the FPS genre, TF2 is a great start."
This Game Is Alltogether Very Well/Badly Put Together . More/Less Effort Should Have Been Put Into It .
if you like fps games and cartoons with intesens gore and hurmer then this game is for you
"Great game, but needs a little new game modes and other stuff."
"This game was great for the first 30 hours I spilled into it; I can no longer enjoy a balanced game through casual matchmaking, and the community has gone sour."
"This is a good game. Many people may not like it, but lots of people like it too. It is original and not like other fps games. If you are looking to buy this game, remember you can't shoot thru glass, sometimes some kills are highly unfair and random. If you play as the spy and you are invisible, you are not invincible. You can get shoot and lit on fire. The pyro can reflect rockets, grenades, flares, and arrows so if you shoot a good pyro, you can get killed. That's it. Yeah... Oh also there are taunt kills. You can literally taunt and kill someone if you have the right weapon out. Oh, but also, valve pays little attention to this game. Some things are broken."
"Lets be honest here, You already played Tf2, bought $400 worth of hats and are now looking for a review to justify your purchase."

"Mere words cannot describe how much I enjoy playing this game. Everytime I get on, I smile, and I have fun. From the weapons with the silly names to the strange and interesting hats, to creative and imaginitve level design, to the fanbase exhibiting fanwork, weapons, maps, and more, this is one my best fandoms and I enjoy what this game has begun after nine years. Valve has dropped a majority of the community, but I have high hopes that Gaben and his pals will straighten things up."
"One of the best games out their, althought I played it mostly 2012 to 2014, I don't play it anymore since the game has changed so much since I used to play it. Now I'm not that good as I'm used to be and will remain as one of my most played games as it provided so much fun and I hope that other people play it and had fun like I did back when I used to play it!"
this game makes me feal good and i love it
"There once was a sandwhich, who was bullied by all the other sandwiches, because he was the special one. He was the sandwhich, who everyone was jealous of. This is no ordinary sandwhich, this is, a sandvich...."
"It is a wonderful game, i really hope you buy it. With all the customization and hats and weapons you will have hours of fun and enjoyment."
Love it...
First game in my steam id. It's the funniest for poor peoples.
"While I've only been playing this game for a short while, I must admit that I am finding my time to be quite enjoyable.   If I were to give this review a single lined summary, I'd have this to say. 'Originality combined with insanity describes Team Fortress 2 pretty damn well.'  However, since I'm not a lazy ♥♥♥, I may as well provide a little more information.   For starters, Team Fortress 2 is fun. Like, really fun. While it can be a giant mess of gobbledygook for the newer players, you'll quickly find yourself sitting back, and enjoying the ride that is Team Fortress. Assuming of course you have a hat that doesn't suck, or else you'll be made fun of by everyone, and kicked from the server, forever to remain alone with offline bots. Seriously, don't wear stupid hats.   There are dozens of unique weapons in this game, all of which can be used or combined with complex gameplay strategies and superior teamwork. Honestly, teamwork will almost always guarantee victory. Ironically, and unlike what the name implies, there is hardly any actual teamwork involved within this game. It makes the rare moments of being healed by a polite Medic, or airblasted when you've been lit by flame, seem almost magical to your naked eyes. It's almost like everything has clicked together to form true harmony, only for the shred of harmony to be ripped away by the cold hard world of stupidity and crockets.   I just can't recommend this game enough. It has some of the best level design I have ever seen in a video game, and it has weapons that make you just want to laugh like a maniac at how freaking cool and unique they are. Plus, the game is constantly receiving new updates by both the highly supportive community, and Valve themselves.    Though, a little word of advice to all of you new players out there? Don't give up if you die often. This game will murder you in brilliantly violent ways. That's just how it is.  You may not have the custom weapons that everyone else has, but that doesn't matter. The stock weapons are just as capable as the unlockables, if not more capable in some cases. (stock sniper for instance)  So, if you feel like rage quitting, or calling the game a stupid pile of jerkface jerky, please just try your hardest to give it a fair chance. Yes, it's hard, and yes, you will die. Yes, you may look weak when compared to the enemy. Yes, I am better than you.... Er, wasn't supposed to say that bit.    Anyway, this game is all about the fun and joy of cartoon madness. Download it. Now."
"It is free and can run okay on toasters. Excellent for slightly cash-strapped users. However, the game has a broken Competitive mode, and does not get the updates it deserves. Most updates add hats or contracts, ways to get money out of your wallet. Although you shouldn't spend too much money on the game, I would recommend buying something in the Mann Co. Store so you get the extra inventory space. Also, if you are trying to get hats, only trade for them. For the price of the cheapest hat on the Mann Co. Store, you can get somewhere around 20 hats by trading."

Good game lots of fun. Could play this game for centurys
" Team Fortress 2  is a follower of the   Team Fortress Classic   game. The game itself is very unique, both in artstyle and it's miscellaneous functionalities. I wouldn't say this game is original though, we've seen fighting games where you can fight between 2 teams and pick characters, etc. However, the extras included in this game are awesome, the items, the trading, the character design, etc. I wouldn't doubt that this game would be of interest to you, because the game is very accepted and very popular, which there's no doubt about, but overall, this is just  Team Fortress 2 , there's not really any other way to explain the game properly! I'd advice you to buy this game if you like coming home from work or school, and just leaving it on the shelf while you play this game, because you'll completely forget about it - which can be both good and bad at the same time.    Story 6/10   Soundtrack 6/10    Atmosphere 4/10   Scenery 6/10   Characters 8/10   Graphics 7/10    Overall 6.5/10"
Awesome Game I loved This game thank you for creating.
cool one
People will love you and accept you.... IF YOU HAVE HATS
"Team Fortress 2 is such an amazing game is to play with your friends. But they still need balance the teams in casual and they need to make more hats. Anyway this game is so much fun, including custom maps."
Still great after all these years
Nominated for The 'Test of Time' Award Team Fortress 2 has been celebrated for its immersive gameplay and diverse selection of characters with their own unique backstories.
The world's best war-themed hat simulator. More casual than things like Overwatch - and that's a good thing.
This game ruined my life and stole my wallet. Send help.
"Haha never reviewed anything in my life before, first of all this game is awesome. It'd be really difficult to find anything wrong with it unless you're extremely pessimistic. Also it's constantly updating which means new content all the time! Not many games do this if they're big shots who make the game and just go on to the next but Valve does something differently with this game. The gameplay, graphics, and sounds are all great. Not many may know but many videos uses Source Filmmaker (SFM) and Gmod to make videos and the TF2 characters are the basis for those. If this game wasn't so damn good then no one would be involving anything from it at all. Overall this game is an awesome game that's worth playing or atleast tried out."
"It doesn't matter how new or familiar you are with the game. Whether you're a player who strives to top-frag, or a passive, friendly player tresspassing on the enemies foreign control points. The game rewards all playstyles, and despite how old it is, it still contains the necessities needed to be deemed 'a great game'. Definitely recommended for anyone, and everyone.  (Just lower the prices on the TF2 in game store, please.)"
This game plays better than my social life. Play this awesome free-to-play game!
If i could decribe tf2 in one word it would be addictive. Though in the beginning you may get your teeth kicked in because of it's high skill ceiling but after a while you start to get better and better and with hundreds of weapon combinations you wont get bored for 1000 of hours

"Everything about this game is terrific but some flaws like Random Crits Get in the way :P  Other than that Competitive is one of the best things you can do with TF2. UGC , Face it, and more competitive ideas out there. u may win some u lose some. :3"
When I first launched this game i thought i'd have 30 hours max in it...Now i have nearly 2900 hours. That basicly sums up the quality of the game
"Can we have new weapons, please ?"
"Ive got over 420 games, like 100 have a metascore over 80 most played game is a free to play one in which i have spend over $300 in hats with sparkles and weapons that track my kills it must be good then"
"This was the very first game I got on steam, and its one of the few games that I consistently play. It has high replayability and the nature of the game is not overly serious.  My main qualm with the game is with the developers not coming out with decent updates. The last really good update that I recall was the 'Love and War' update that came out over two years ago. My FPS in this game is also considerably lower than in games like CS:Go, but that might just be the way this game is optimized.  Despite all these issues, I'd still recommend those who are even vaguely interested to give TF2 a try!"
"This is game the best game FPS I've ever played in my life. It's fun, it's creative with it's rocket jumping, sticky jumping, trimping, surfing, ect. This game is more creative than COD or any other FPS out there. Also the stages in this game are colorful with various different type of colors. I recommend this game to people who love Half-Life or any other Valve game, creative warfare, and to those people who are sick and tried from COD; or any other FPS."
"Team Fortress 2 is an almost decade old team based, first person shooter developed by Valve. When I say the game is almost a decade old, I in no way am saying it is a bad thing. While yes, the game does show its age here and there. It is a game that after all this time has not lost any of its charm. The game has a light-hearted cartoon like art style. Why that may make it sound like childish, it in no way is childish and adds a unique flare to the game. This game is not your typical first person shooter. The biggest thing that makes it not your typical first person shooter is the fact that it is more objective based. The next aspect of this game is also classed based, there are a total of nine classes, each with a unique personality. From there you can customize your classes to fit your play style as there are over five hundred unlockable weapons, each one with its own unique stats and uses. You can also go as far as customizing on how your classes look with cosmetics. There are two different teams of mercenaries you can play on. RED (Reliable Excavation Demolition) and BLU (Builders League United), and the role the team has depends on the game mode. The game also has a good backstory. It's not super in-depth, but it is enough to give you the basic idea on why RED and BLU are fighting in the first place. In this game there is no right way to play, you just play. This game also has an insanely high skill ceiling; I have 2600 hours played in this game, and I'm still learning things about this game.  There are multiple game modes that are available to play in the game. There is: Payload, Attack/Defend, King of the Hill, Control Points, Payload Race, Mannpower, PASS Time, Player Destruction, and a sleuth of different community made game mode.  Classes - The nine classes are further divided up and put in the category’s: Offensive, Defensive, and Support. The Scout, Soldier, and Pyro fall under offensive. The Heavy, Demoman, and Engineer are listed under defensive. The Medic, Sniper, and Spy can be found under the support group. Each classed have their own unique weapons, abilities, and characteristics.   In the most recent big update, Meet Your Match, Valve replaced Quickplay with Casual, and finally rolled out the Competitive mode. They are by no means perfect, however they are a lot better than they were at the launch of the update. Though if you are a new player, I doubt you will be affected by the removal of quickplay, as you never knew what quickplay was like. The only downside is see in this game, though this is situational, is the community. At times the community can be great and pleasant, but you will also run into the biggest A$$holes. You will run into them often, not on an every match basis, but at least once a day, at least. Though over the years, I've just come to ignore those people, and actually find enjoyment in watching them rage while insults about your mom flow out of their mouth at a rate equal to the diarrhea you get from eating the two-week old burrito you found in the back of the fridge the other day.  In the end, I highly recommend this game. I've been playing this game for years, but it never seems to get boring nor lose its touch. I still feel like I just downloaded the game and entering my first game. I've been through thick and thin with this game, and invested so much time and money into this game. I play   Enjoy"
"An oldie but golden game which you can play for hours and hours with friends or by yourself.  About a year ago, I decided to try out TF2 because... 'I was bored out of my mind and wanted to try something new'. Even though TF2 isn't 'new', it was to me because of it's genre: FPS. I wasn't a big fan but when I got into the game, it . . . wasn't so bad. Just different from what I expected. I wasn't into TF2 until I hit the community servers. TF2 has an interesting community and if it wasn't the community, I don't think I would have stuck around. I have met many people, some who later became my friends, who taught me a lot about TF2's game mechanics, their classes, and their game modes. From community servers to Valve (then Casual Mode) to competitive, I've enjoyed this game a lot more than I thought.  So what's the verdict? It's a great game but lately Valve hasn't done much 'updating' . . . It's more like they're pushing all their updates towards the community but, you get to see the community's huge creative side and people who makes TF2 a great game again. Valve took too long bringing in their Casual and Competitive modes, but it has made many people re-think how to play each class, each game mode, and each map. It has gone through some bad updates but the game survived (somewhat). Sure Valve is slowly neglecting TF2 for other products, but the community holds strong by bringing in their contents and make it great. With 2000+ hours on this game, I still enjoy it because I get to see some interesting, and sometimes frustrating, things whenever I play. So have fun and meet some great people."
"The community complains too much. The game is still great in its current state, regardless of any minor flaws or nitpicks it may have. It's going to survive for a good long time, and i still consider this the best game in my library for just having fun."
"Team fortress 2 is a very fun and enjoyable game. It is very unique and different then any other game that I have ever played. It features 9 classes, each with different roles and skills. There are many weapons, gamemods, and alot of great people. The game never gets boring and is alot of fun. It is probobly the best game I have ever played. I strongly recommend it for its fun content, unique weapons and the endless amount of laughs it creates."
Great game. Could do with some optimization however.
Will work at mcdonalds for more hat money
It's k.
"with fun weapons and an awesome fanbase, tf2 is a game for everyone...except tryhards. I want to die"
An enjoyable game with enough depth in gameplay mechanics to keep me coming back for more!
That I can keep coming back to this game after 9 years should be more than enough to encourage you to give it a shot.
This game is forever.
a toxic community and a solid fps
My wallet has been severely injured by this game. gg
"Team Fortress 2 is the purest incarnation of Valve's philosophy: listening to their audience, constant and free updating, and forever over-delivering to their supporters and followers. Absolutely my favorite classed-based multiplayer game of all-time."
♥♥♥♥
"2700 Hours in this game, still love it c:"
"THE GAME IS AWESOME!!!   When i have installed steam in 2013 i found this game. It was free to play so i downloaded it and began to play. I played 1000+ hours and I'm still impressed by this game!  Pros: +Nice graphics. +Cool soundtrack (i mostly liked it😊).  +9 classes and every class has its advantages and disadvantages. +There are less cheaters now and i love it! +HATS AND TAUNTS!!! +The community is pretty good and there are many illustrations and memes in the Internet about Tf2! +Random crits!   But every game has cons and this game is not an exception.  Cons: -Ping can go further and sometimes i have over 300 ping but then it normalizes and i have my 40-45 ping again) -the last Meet Your Match update is good but now i have to wait 1-10 min to play one game. -Random crits... -Pyro is now imbalanced class((((   I didn't find more cons, 'cause this game is great, thanks Valve!!!      Pootis😋"
When I first launched this game i thought i'd have 30 hours max in it...Now i have nearly 2900 hours. That basicly sums up the quality of the game
"Can we have new weapons, please ?"
"Ive got over 420 games, like 100 have a metascore over 80 most played game is a free to play one in which i have spend over $300 in hats with sparkles and weapons that track my kills it must be good then"
"This was the very first game I got on steam, and its one of the few games that I consistently play. It has high replayability and the nature of the game is not overly serious.  My main qualm with the game is with the developers not coming out with decent updates. The last really good update that I recall was the 'Love and War' update that came out over two years ago. My FPS in this game is also considerably lower than in games like CS:Go, but that might just be the way this game is optimized.  Despite all these issues, I'd still recommend those who are even vaguely interested to give TF2 a try!"

"Team Fortress 2 is best game in valve after Countre Strike and half life and Left 4 Dead and Day of Defeat, actually this game you can waste all your time there  but its have some good things and some bad things  Good things is play with friends win good weapons having fun and ofc you know choose one of 9 classes   Bad things i don't care about people say its alot of russians or less russians this not problem but the problem is alot of campers alot of bad words alot of Kids there actually i saw about 1120 kid there but however this game still number 1 in my favorit games (☞ﾟ∀ﾟ)☞ :D  Note: if Vavle make Team Fortress 3 it will be bad idea."
"This game gotta be one of the most fun and thrilling games I have ever played. It does not have any restrictions other than being premium which you gives you more inv slot. Other than that the game itself has so much freedom as it does not have a main objective to it. And of course, the hats...c:"
"hats, thats all this game is about."
interesting
"Dota 2 has more players, CS:GO has more players, but this game has more fun. You enjoy it even if you lose. Released a long time ago but still with new content. Quite unusual experience with nine completely different classes. The perfect candidate for  The “Test of Time” Award ."
"Team Fortress 2 is an online multiplayer class-based shooter made by Valve Corporation, the people behind the Half-Life, Counter Strike and many other big franchises.    How's the gameplay?"
"This game..is my childhood..i played it for 1000+ hours and i still cant get enough of it..i always come back even if i dont know what should i do in tf2.But the community..the humour...i cant describe how much this game means to me so you should try it for yourself.Trust me,you will have hella good time playing it..if not then im bad at reviewing games.(btw sorry for my bad english)"

"I only played for a little, but it was good."
Best war based hat simulator. Gameplay is very unique and art style of the game is nice. I would recommend it to people who like free to play games.
Pretty sure tens of thousands of people don't waste hundreds of hours a day on an 'okay' game. Yeah.
Somehow they made it great again.
This game is very unique in that it has classes. Each class offers completely different gameplay and special abilities. It is not like other shooters. Try it. It's free.
Hats hats and more hats 10/10 would watch gibus players run of the map again
"Half-Life 2, Portal 2, Left 4 Dead 2, Team Fortress 2... Valve doesn't know how to count to three, but sometimes this isn't necessary."
Best Game ever made. Stood the test of time. Exponentiel fun.  
"Best free to play game i've ever had the pleasure playing, thank you very much creators of Team Fortress 2 for making such a nice game, I honestly can say this is without a doubt my most favorite game I've ever played."
This game is really good. Only one thing is bad.And that thing is matchmaking.I allways plays against stronger players.But still like this game.
A nice game to play really good to get good aim and play with other people fun gamemodes

"If you ask me, there is no point in denying this game! it stood the test of time, so it prooved to several generations of gamer!"
"Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is the sequel to the game that put class-based, multiplayer team warfare on the map. TF2 delivers new gametypes, a signature art style powered by Valve’s next generation animation technology, persistent player statistics, and more. Unlike other 'class-based' games that offer a variety of combat classes only, Team Fortress 2 packs a wild variety of classes which provide a broad range of tactical abilities and personalities, and lend themselves to a variety of player skills. Play as the flame-throwing Pyro, the room clearing Heavy, or the Spy, a master of disguises. Other classes include: Scout, Sniper, Medic, Engineer, Demoman, or Soldier. TF2 features the most advanced graphics of any Source-based game released to date – and the most exciting class-based action ever created."
"I mean, it's still the best game.   PROS: Everything  CONS: I don't know, MatPat?  That's it. You're done. Go eat a sandwich or something."
"This game is awesome! I got it with 'The Orange Box' back in 2011. I was only interested in hl2 and portal. I didn´t like tf2. Then, I don´t know how, I started playing it and today it´s the game with most spended hours I have. I have met a lot of good people. It´s so much fun and I have a special fondness for this game. I will keep playing this game to infinity and beyond!"
"10/10, best hat simulator on the market. Enjoy killing your nemesis in 100 diferent ways while wearing that $800 virtual hat you just bought! *looks sick as f*ck tho*"
The best free to play game that I ever played.  You can play with your friends and customize your classes :) Too much fun.

"This game is mainly the reason why I even have a steam account in the first place. I have played this game for around 3 years already and to be honest I never seem to get bored of it yes there are times I stop playing tf2 to play different games but, I always find myself playing tf2 later on. I recommend for you to try this game out since it's well free and who says no to a free game."
Its alright so far. Might need some more play time on it though
UPDATE: The community of this game is so toxic you won't last long but find some friends to play with and it can be tolerable. It doesn't have the same charm it did when I started playing but it's still fun to fire up every once in a while.
"Its really good game, when u can learn lot of activities about before u just dream. Im looking forward to u in game."
"Really really really nice game, enjoying it. Playing this every week with my friends and that's fun.  I think this the only game on Steam that is very cool and FREE!! That's unbelivable. I hope that there will come a TF3 in the future, but well done makers of the game!! "
10/10 would pootis again 10/10 would nominate again
I don't know what I'm doing here I'm just looking for the can.

"I am not playing tf2 anymore, or that's what i think. The idea is after a long time when you have't played this game you return to it at some point because is just a fun game. Sadly valve is killing tf2 almos everyday but i still think that i will play tf2 for a long time. 10/10 for the game but i can't give a good mark to valve."
awesomeness is strong with this bad ♥♥♥ game!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I've put in (insert amount of hours you see) into this game and I still haven't been able to excape this hellish prison that encapsules my very soul, please for the love of god, end my misery and existential pain. Other than that I enjoy this game a lot and I'm glad to see it is still thriving. Enjoy your free game you poor unfortunate children"
"Has a man child pretending to be tough only to be followed by bad luck. Has a man that represents americans very well, tough and dumb. Has a man so twisted not even a hook to be a crook for him. Has a black scottish drunk that can hit you like a truck or kill himself. Has a russian that is smart and strong but is low in speed making him the most bullied class. Has a texan with 10+ PHD's in engineering, but still somehow can't make a 'NOT DYING MASHINE'. Has a german who is a doctor who can become a GOD for 8 full seconds, yet still not enough to destroy a sentry nest. Has a New Zelad folk that tought he was australia, he also found out his parents didnt want him. And has a French man who can be either very easy or hard to kill.  Welcome to this amazing game called Team Fortress 2.  btw yes I am scared of grammar mistakes :^)"
"Completely different from all shooters out there. I totally recommend it. Just be careful of the Conga Virus (Or Kazotzky or Mannrobics, whatever). Almost 10 year game and still looks attractive and does compete with games of the same genre."
"Good game, but meet your match update sucks!"
Better than overwatch
Nice game.
"After 1500+ hours, you would think I'd be bored of this by now. But no. This games has so many updates (some not so good as others) that keep you coming back to try something new. Has clearly withstood the test of time as its still growing a following."
a very good game allow you to play multiplayer or co-op so easliy
"I can be a russian, who has a REALLY tiny head. 10/10"
" 10 out of 10. Excellent game.    TF2 VS Other FPS's (specifically COD):  Call Of Duty, one of the most popular games in the world, is a 'Restart-Unimprovement' Game. That is a phrase I use to describe games that, when you have everything and you restart your progress, your gameplay will decrease. In COD, the more you level up your guns, the better attachments you get for them. Making you play BETTER in return! TF2 is different. In TF2 there is NO leveling up, and the Stock weapons (the ones you start out with at the beggining) are statistically speaking, the best weapons in the game. Also, TF2 and CS:GO are the only FPS's I know that have a MARKET and TRADING SYSTEM. If you are a Free-To-Play, you don't even have to spend any money to customize your character! You can find weapons, and then sell them for metal. Which you can then use to buy hats and such!   THE BEST FPS Out There:  TF2 is the best First-Person-Shooter I have ever seen, and I am not alone saying that. The main reason why is because of the massive community, TF2 is a game that will never die due to it's amazing array of support from Map and Mod Makers, Animators who can create incredible movies using Source Filmmaker, and the general hardcore-players who have devoted thousands of hours to the game and still don't know everything about it; Which brings me to my second point. The skill ceiling is probably the highest in the world. Getting to truly master a class, takes months, or posibly YEARS, of practice; And I'm not just saying that. Can you play soldier? Can you rocket jump? Can you take that to the next level and do the infamous Upward-Jump? Can you C-tap? What about market gardening or using the Direct Hit? The Air Strike? Ect. TF2 is hard to learn, and IMPOSSIBLE to master. Combined with the largest game community since League Of Legends, makes this game the BEST FPS out there."
"Now I don't know how on earth you got from TFC (Team Fortress Classic) to this, I mean it's in no way similar, but I LOVE IT. It's bloody amazing! The style of it and the unique things you can get on the market for a cheap price. Yeah, you find things for free but have to pay for something else to make full use of it, but it's still good. If you search the market, you can get it cheaper anyway. (Still waiting to find a Mann. Co Crate Key for the Limited Summer Crates, haven't the money to buy it.)  I call this game GOTY every year, because it is just untoppable. Brilliant work, Valve! Keep updating this game with amazing ideas and I'll be passing it down generation to generation."
"This game is amazing, even for its age, its way better than most nowadays. Its F2P, but its NOT a P2W, the only thing you can buy is cosmetics, taunts, skins...nothing that impact the gameplay Of course, if you have cosmetics, you will be kinda...Intimidating, and this will help you more than you think. It may be kinda tough to get used to all the mechanics, takes time to get, at least, good(i'll get there), but it is worth it  Now the horrible, horrible downside The community. how can i say it? It's a cancer, and it is getting worst and worst every minute, it spread like a desease. Sometimes you catch yourself acting like that, and its a shame to see such great game, getting killed by those pests. Yeah, you will find friendly players, of course, but its like seeing a unicorn in hell.  So, if you like chaos, seeing unicorns in hell, guns and explosions what are you waiting for? Why are you still reading this? Go install the game ffs  [Sorry for the bad english]"
"Although the game has suffered so much for so long, it is that now is trying to stay afloat but still leaves to be desired. It's okay that you can personalize your character with hats and all kinds of cosmetics with reference to a favorite series or a game that you liked a lot, but there is so much variety of caps that there are times that you ask, 'Is it necessary so much ? '  Weapons are the best, since you can do a lot of things with the variety of weapons that the game has, such as sniper an archer, or a doctor can heal at great distances with only a crossbow, the truth Weapons are what, for me, make the game exciting and fun because with each weapon there are a lot of strategies right behind those statistics. But there are always problems, as they are too 'broken' in the sense that it is too easy to kill with them, or that it is trash and is useless, you must always find an intermediary and I have to admit that you get to that intermediate it's hard.  After so much text and say the things that I think of the game in a summary, I have to say that I still like it very much despite so much change, I think they are improving it little by little and I hope it is so. Needless to say, I thank you for reading everything I've written."
10 out of 10
"Great game, can provide you with 100s of hours of fun. 10/10 ign"
"Meh could be better, didn't play it very much."
It ruined my life 
I love trading on this game because I meet new friends nearly every game. :)
"Team Fortress 2 is a First - Person Shooter that millions of people have played. You can customize yourself with hats, shirts, weapons and so on. Although you have to pay real world money for hats or trade. If you are Free - to - Play, don't bother the insults Premiums throw at you. You're here just to have fun, right? Well, who am I kidding. Why recommend this game when you should have already gotten it? Score: 10/10 stars. Although once you had your fill of fun, you have to play other games otherwise TF2 will soon get boring."
traded my unusual sammy cap for a ghostly gibbus with pink paint. 10/10 profit
I can't stop playing this game. It's just SO fun!
"Tbh, after playing this game for a while, I find it to be ♥♥♥♥, I still love it, but the problems i've discovered during my time playing has made it an unexjoyable experience at times  If valve actually put time into it like they did in CS:go, it would be a whole new story  The following list describes my complaints about the current version  1. Hitboxes, seriously valve, you're gonna stick a couple of rectangles in the models and classify that as the hitscan/melee wep hitbox?, there are so many gaps between the rectangles and so far, the only thing I've seen you patch was the engie's invincible ♥♥♥♥. Also, why the ♥♥♥♥ is the projectile hitbox a giant ♥♥♥ rectangle? It doesn't even rotate with the player axis, and creates so much fake reg for splash abuse weps.  2. Hitreg, might be me, might not be me, but according to 'hitscan', when i click on someone, it should be a instant, perfect registration, but i'm forced to preaim with hitscan weapons in order to recieve any registration at all.  3. The flamethrower, this weapon is abused by many who can't be bothered to learn how to aim properly, I'm not concerned about the lack of skill it takes to use the primary fire function, but its the hit range of the primary attack function that gets me worked up, the hit range exceedes the particle effect in place to reperesent the hit range, so why have the particle effect there if it means absolute ballocks  4. Huntsman, looks like you amplified the hitboxes by whatever multipler you chose when this weapon is active  5. Splash-damage based weapons, again, this is something similar to the flamethrower, the actual splash range also exceeds the particle effect generated, it might also be beacuse of your ridiculous projectile hitboxes.  6. Spy backstab range, so you're saying that stabbing someone in the arm counts as an insta kill?, great logic there, also, this relates back to my first complaint, the hitbox lags behind, so even if i turn to face the spy, i still get stabbed, great.  Overall, this game had potential, but was butt♥♥♥♥ed but broken ♥♥♥ mechanics that no-one bothered to fix"
"Ths game is very good, however, very susceptible to hacking and cheats. Also, not having good gear may make you fell like you suck, but you actually don't. Besides those things, this is an extremely good game, great graphics, better than most COD games (except WAW). Random drrops are good, some stuff in the shop is too expensive. One tip for noobs, no matter what people say, random crits are not fair and balanced, those people are full of fish turds."
"I love this game and its a great way for me to relieve some stress. i love every aspect of it. no matter how badly the game might do, it will allways be my game and ill allways love it and accept its flaws. theres no such thing as a perfect game. btw i LOVE my friend dots for showing me this amazing game, that has become my greatest source of inspiration. i do wish to mod this game one day - hopefully... and that i could be working closely with other tf2 ethusiasts to further mod the game that i so greatly admire. its also my favourite dress-up game XD  remember as it is right now only 5 people work on the ♥♥♥♥in game ... come on they need some help D:"
The only reason i have friends cough phishers
"Amazing game even with the MYM update:   Gud stuff:  - hats  - reskins  - different colors to spell the name of your item  - unusuals  - original and funny classes, well balanced gameplay (altho this are just the bread crumbs)   Bad stuff:  - lose your job  - lose your girlfriend (boyfriend)  - your wallet gets ♥♥♥♥♥ every 2 months  - hackers (altho they are much harder to find these days)     11/10 burning team captains"
I really do love this game! I have been dying to play this game and now I finally got a chance to play! Love the charcaters I love everything. I really do recommend this game!
"I think it's around time to remake this review.  Ever since the major backlash from Meet Your Match, the Team Fortress team has really been trying a bit harder to actually update their game and fix some bugs that have been around a while, like the crouch exploit or being able to build outside the playable area or being able to shoot through certain spawn gates. I'm just hoping that this newfound 'try a bit harder or else we'll lose players' is long term and not some sort of damage control that'll have their communication and slightly more frequent updates fade by Christmas. If the team keeps this up, I see a better future for Team Fortress both competitively and casually than it was in perhaps one or two years ago, when numbers started dipping.  Now this doesn't means everything right now is perfect and nothing needs changing. I can make a list of all the currently known things that TF2 needs fixed, like certain balancing issues revolving around certain classes and playstyles, the hot mess that is competitive mode, abandonment penalties (and how they completely ruin competitive for me), and many more. But I have faith in the team that they can listen to these complaints and fix or otherwise rework them. They have shown recently that they can fix things quickly, like how a bug having to deal with MvM was fixed the very next day the issue was brought up. But again, I hope that they stay on their game long term and don't just slow down when things go more smoothly.  The game has an amazing community who are truly passionate in the game, who has (mostly) stuck with the game even through its toughest points. This is especially prevalent in just how many community updates I've seen in the past, who the contributors to said updates have truly created some phenomenal things from weapons to cosmetics to full-blown maps. And they do this with absolutely no guarantee that they're going to get their items in the game. It's also shown in how they are several people talking about the issues that the game has/had on places like Reddit and YouTube. If they didn't care about this game nearly as much as they did, they probably would have just straight up leave instead of sticking with the game and talking about its issues.  While I am starting to play TF2 less and less because of what I call 'life moving me forward', I do see several people joining and supporting this game in general, but especially competitively in the future."
I launch the game from the last time I had played (about a 2-4 months ago) and I see everyong doing this strane dance... CONGA! twenty outa ten game of the year wins a saxxy every day!
"Tf2 is a very unique fps game, adding 9 classes which most other fps games don't have. I also think Tf2 is very balanced compared to other games such as call of duty where one gun would be the best, but in tf2 all weapons (except the stock weapons) have a negative aspect as well as a positive one. Yes some weapons may be better than others but if you use the weapons in a good way they will work. If any weapons is deemed overpowered (op) will be nerfed. The uniqueness of tf2 is what I feel makes tf2 such a good standout game (as well as the price tag) There are countless hours to play into tf2 and you will always see a different player. Many funny moments await you in tf2 and I hope to see you guys on the battlefield soon!"
"It's the game I've played the most hours on PC and for good reason: it's a tight, stylized, balanced (unless a team stacks-against you) cooperative FPS. As with a lot of similar-type games, TF2 is exponentially more fun if you have a couple friends on voice-chat so you can time attacks and defenses. While some are harder to master than others, each class offers a variety of different gameplay mechanics. Love how they've added a lot of personality into each one as well. Oh: and don't forget to say thanks to the Medics!"
"Fantastic game! You better be downloading it right now!  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Editing this review because the game has changed a lot since I used to play it regularly, I still go on it every now and then. In my opinion the community is not the same as it used to be Definitely still a good game. There's still no point in reading these reviews because you can try out the game for free"
Volvo plz fix game un nerf axtinqusiher plz i want sketchek back ty
"It's got a great balance of individual effort and teamwork. The community is awesome. And, for a nearly decade-old game, it's still going strong. It's not perfect, but it's one of the best experiences I've had with a game."
I cant play this because i use the tf2 hack srry volvo plz help me 
Best Game I have Ever played
Game is cute. I hope we will get the sequel with the same characters in the future.
This is the best game ever made
"Great fun to play! Hours of fun to be had! And don't forget to buy more hats, it makes you better at the game."
"Great fps, there are many modes to pick from, characters, and weapons that change your playstyle, the game is 9/10 because I do have ONE issue with the game, that issue is called the 'pyro' now, pyro is that ONE op character that has no counters and counters every class. Let me give you some examples, He's the bastion of tf2, he's the teemo of tf2. Basically, he's op as hell! Lemme give you some examples, pyro can can get LOTS of critz very fast, there are lots of crit combos for him, lemme give you a few, flamethrower + airblast + flaregun = instant death. Heres another one, Flamethrower + Axtinguisher = Instant death, still not sure? Here's the best example of all, Neon Anihillator + Wet player = really fast INSTANT death. All the classes are fun, except the pyro, theres always that one pyro doing nothing but running around setting people on fire and getting the MVP. As I said earlier, he has litterally no weaknesses, he has fast speed, gets critz easy, but not even rocket launchers can counter this guy, he can just airblast them back, I'm personnally fine with this, but pyro needs to have at least ONE weakness, and if there happens to be a pyro on enemy team you can airblast people on your team to put them out, but guess what? INSTANT HP BACK!!!!! So he's fast, he gets critz, he has no counters. Now, onto the list of things he can deflect, rockets, grenades and even arrows!!! So basically, Pyro is OP. He has no counters. All the other characters are fine though. Let me give you more examples;  Heavy; Strong but slow Engineer; Can build sentrys, but sentrys can be sapped So theres a few examples, its a 9/10 game, if pyro was nerfed it would be a 10/10."
"This game takes a bit of time to get the hang of, and is a great game to play with friends! 10/10 would recommend again"
An amazing game that help define f2p multiplayer fps.  Why?  9 unique classes that each have unique abilities that act as checks and balance to the other classes. A succesful team will learn to balance and cordiante attacks.  That playtime doesn't lie
"I love this game, it is so colorful, and easy to learn the basics. The community is diverse, and sometimes rude, but overall amazing ! You can find so much to like with so many gamemodes, and updates. The entire thing is so well made, and is not perfect. So you can go serious, or casual, but you will have a good time. This is amazing."
Cool and awesome game

Totaly recommendet.
"this game is my favorite on steam, i like how each character has their own roll, and how theres differeent things you can do, like collecting items, and dressing up your characters, and even being able to talk to people, i would recommend this :)"
It's a pretty good game... I guess.
good to jump on servers and become everyone's friend when the learn you main medic.  pubs are magical
"Played a bit, Its ok."

"It's got a great balance of individual effort and teamwork. The community is awesome. And, for a nearly decade-old game, it's still going strong. It's not perfect, but it's one of the best experiences I've had with a game."
The game were 5 snipers and 3 spies in a team of 12 is not enough.  Love it.  I rate it a solid 5/7.  Would go and get myself sticky spammed again.  
Best Game I Played Ever Until I Found Paladins!  But I Still Playing Dis Game!  Also I Played Csgo When i bored!  This Game Should Be Liked!
great for learners
Furries everywhere
Cool and awesome game
I would recommend this game to all players who enjoy first-person-shooter games just like i have its really fun and also addicting at the same time
virtual hats worth more than trump tower
Best free game I've ever played. DO GET THIS GAME
give me all of your keys gaben or ill tell mom amd you will be in big trouble &gt;:(
you get spawn camped by a tryhard soldier who is being pocket mediced. best game evr :)
"This is the game that I spent so much time and money in. Was it necessarily worth it? No. But the friends I made along the way, and the experiences I had because of this game changed my life. That sounds cheesy, but it is 100% the truth. It isn't the same game I first played in 2010. But it most definitely still an impactful game both on my personal life, and in the gaming industry in general. The community gave this game so much life, and that is why it is still kicking even after 10+ years after it was first released. If you haven't tried this game yet, please do."
"Great Game, never get bored of it always stuff to do always updating, so many gamemodes ways to pass time, great experience user friendly (most of the time) but most importantly hats?  I'm Grateful after 2375 hours I got my first hat c:"
I think this is one of the greatest and definitely most fun games ever let alone the fact it is free. Definitely Recomend!
I do not like RiceGum i believe he is unfunny and his content only appeals to young impressionable teenagers who unironically still think 'what are those' is funny. ♥♥♥♥ RiceGum. (i do enjoy this game though 7/10)
"Great fun to play! Hours of fun to be had! And don't forget to buy more hats, it makes you better at the game."
Game is cute. I hope we will get the sequel with the same characters in the future.
"Even after 3000+ hours in this game, its still as fun as it was in the beginning. Just play it with some friends (as stupid as yourself) and trust me you wil have the time of your life!"
"It's decent, mostly because of how you have the choice to pay for in-game items or not. I highly recommend this if you like shooting, cosmetics, uncrating systems, etc."
i would recomend this gae anyday of the week but there is one thing that ruins it the meet your match update valve doesnt even play this game but they make terrible updates but now i would not recommend tf2 untill a later update
I am trying to bring Wing Chun Martial Arts to a 'shotgun game'       and it's working.
you get spawn camped by a tryhard soldier who is being pocket mediced. best game evr :)
Great I guess.
I love this game. Most people on steam have this. You are not a person who goes on steam unless you have TF2. Plus its free!
"Favorite game of all time. Incredible experience from the start up until now. Awesome gameplay (movement, class interactions, etc.)."

"I had brain cancer back then, sorry"
"Haha, haven't had this much fun in a fps in a while."
its ok i guess lol haha
Hi.. Its fun :D
It is so good that it never gets too old or too tiring for me!
Really fun game enjoyable   10000000000000/10
"Thank you for 'fixing' casual, valve, but MYM was still the worst update in tf2 history. At LEAST have it so that the teams are scrambled at the end of the first round, because 99.9% of the time, the team that won first is going to win again."
This Is Literalty The Best Game Ive Ever Played. Good Job Valve
good to jump on servers and become everyone's friend when the learn you main medic.  pubs are magical
Totaly recommendet.
"Played a bit, Its ok."
I just love wasting my hard earned money on this magnificent hat simulator and so will you if you get this game.
"Meet Your Match, or as I like to call it. 'Let's take everything that made TF2 and burn it on a cross while weaering white robs and praying to our all knowing great magician Gaben' It broke half the game, the time that it takes to get in a casual match is unbearable, the phlog was buffed for some unholy reason, and this ♥♥♥♥ing Competative match making dosen't even work unless you pay 10$! Or have you're account verified from a ♥♥♥♥ing phone. Who the ♥♥♥♥ though that this was a good idea?  RIP Team Fortress 2, I loved you.  Also the game still runs like horse ♥♥♥♥ and it's over 8 years old. Volvo fix this game god damn it."
Collect hats to make better hats to buy better hats to make yourself better than people with less better hats. And has a bunch of FPS non hat bull you don't care about.
"I would totally recommend this game yes alot of people think tf2 is dead we should just buy overwatch well tf2 isn't dead. It is very fun and addictive to me. A lot of the not recommended reviews are just people complaining about the meet your match update and yes i do understand since valve doesn't really care anymore but tf2 is still 1 of my favourite games to play. Right now i think tf2 isn't dieing it's just not growing and it is still very popular anyway i'm sure the next update will male tf2 great again when we get frontline, Mayan project and Iron gauntlet could save tf2 and get a lot of people to join again.  Anyway I recommend a lot of people to play it is still very fun to play with the 9 classes to choose from."
"This is a pretty good game, its free. If it lags, dont blame the game, blame ur laptop doesnt have enough memory "
One of those games you can play for hundreds of hours. Can confirm.
"This game is amazing. It's changed my life for the better. Although the community is toxic, as is every gaming community in some ways, it's very minor. The community is welcoming to people who want change, something different to the usual Shoot-em up games.  The game itself is great, graphics are pristine and have a childish yet lovable look to it, and don't get me started on hats.  You can make friends just by finding a good valve server, and just generally have a good time unless a tryhard comes along and ruins it. The classes are diverse, everyone has a role to play so no one gets bored. Taunts are in a variety and if people are bored with the base game they could play another mode like Freak Fortress, Slender fortress, etc. It's overall a great game and recommend it to anyone who feels like the game they're currently frequenting is wearing them out, TF2 is unique. and absolutely refreshes what you think of FPS communities as a whole.  "
"Everytime an Engie says, 'Nope.' a Gaben gets his Steam."
This is the only game that makes me rage more than Battlefield 3 / Bad Company 2.
"I love it. Full of action, tryhards, noobs, pros, cons, and more!   MOAR GUNS AND COSMETICS 4 SNIPER   I love it.  10/10"
One of the best games I ever had on steam. Although the market can be a troll sometimes...
"This game is something special. Any game that can hold my interest after more than 3 years and 2000 hours kinda has to be. On top of that, it's 100% free, and the only free to play game I've seen yet that is NOT pay to win.  On top of THAT, I love that you can play it in super-serious tryhard mode or just run around doing something silly and have fun either way (and not get yelled at, I should mention the community for this game kicks ♥♥♥)  What I'm trying to say is, GET THIS GAME, IT'S AMAZING Plus, even if you don't like it, it's not like it cost you anything  "
it is rlly good for free game
This game is a nice fps but after you started trading TF2 is going to change for you. You might want to collect all the hats in the game but a month later 60 (maybe more) new items will get added into the game. And the result is: Gaben will eat your fresh dollars from your wallet.
It's just that good!
"A fun, teamwork oriented FPS. I really enjoy the cartoonish style of the characters and the maps. Valve is consitently pumping out new updates. I love halloween and christmas as you get a lot of free cosmetics and weapons. Though it may seem to be dying out to games like Overwatch, there is still a vibrant community of people who are passionate about this great game."

Addictive and pulls money from my wallet. Needs more hats and hats.
Great game with personality plus it never gets boring. :spycon:
"Team Fortress 2 is a phenomenal game that everyone should get a chance to play. You can play as 9 classes (Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy) and each class their own unique abilities and weapons that make up what they are. Also, you can play 7 different game modes (Payload, King Of The Hill, Control Points, Attack/Defense, Payload Race, Capture The Flag and Special Delivery.) that have their own unique ways that mixes the gameplay up a little. There's even Mann Vs. Machine, where you play co-op and defend Mann Co. from robots that are just like the regular classes in Team Fortress 2. Not to mention there's a lot more weapons than just the stock weapons. Plus, hats. More hats that you can even imagine.  11/10 Another one of the best multiplayer games out there."
"An amazing game thats for all sort of people, i will guarentee that. After being amazing its fun and nice to play with friends 1. u have the Co-Op mode 2. U can simply join ur friends due the servers tab 3. U can make ur own maps and play them with your friends. All-in Awesome!"
This has been a great game since I bought it for $20. Valve never has let me down.
Welcome to the Mods and Cosmetics Simulator

"I fully recommend this game if you are just looking for a fun and casual game. There are nine classes, many maps and several game modes to choose from. The game has some bugs and glitches, but overall a good game and it's free! You can even make some money out of it by getting involved in the item trading."
10/10 Recommend  The Game is great and fun this is the best First Person shooting game for me :)  Download it 100% Free And a Great Game :))
Simply ... The Best.
"'#1 War-themed hat simulator in America' You know this means there are other war-themed hat simulators out there. But still this game, TF2, will stay in my heart as the best war-themed hat simulator in the universe."
Has hats
"Went to play a match of CTF couldn't choose the map. Couldn't choose just CTF it had to be somthing else selected that I had no disire to play. Waited, and waited, AND WAITED. 15 minutes into waiting to play and be connected I left to grab a snack, came back and I was kicked due to inactivity, understandable as I was unattentive. Second time loading and 30 minutes later I was placed in a random map I didn't even want, I left. A few attempts of leaving to pray to be connected to a server I wanted with the game mode I wanted well, now i'm BANNED TILL FRIDAY FOR LEAVING A CASUAL GAME. FIX IT VALVE. If I wanted to play a competive game with competive penalties I wouldn't have TF2 in my library."
Meet your Match sucks
This game is a nice fps but after you started trading TF2 is going to change for you. You might want to collect all the hats in the game but a month later 60 (maybe more) new items will get added into the game. And the result is: Gaben will eat your fresh dollars from your wallet.
It's just that good!
"A fun, teamwork oriented FPS. I really enjoy the cartoonish style of the characters and the maps. Valve is consitently pumping out new updates.

This game has stolen way too much of my time. 10/10
Best hat simulator ever.
"A long time ago, I reviewed this game in hopes that people would get the message: Hats are the main focus of this game. Apparently, this warning went unnoticed by many. Some people actually play this game for the GAMEPLAY!!!  This is not good.  Not good at all.  I mean, the gameplay is actually great, but so many uncultured people don't understand the real reason this game was created. To simulate hat trading.  This is actually a very complex game on the inside, despite it's violent and mindless exterior. So many hats to buy and sell... so much money to spend...  I have not spent too much time on this game, but my opinion is set in stone: Playing the game the way it was originally intended to be played is a complete waste of potential. Buying and trading hats is the most important part of this game, and if you are not doing it, you will be known as a noob throughout all trade servers in the land.  Want to have fun with this game? Ha. I laugh. This game, while it can be fun, is not meant to amuse anyone. It is meant to simulate the Hat trading market, and if you think otherwise you are just kidding yourself.  So in conclusion, this is a great game. But that's not what it should be. That's not what it is. It is not a 'game'. It is life. It demonstrates the fragility of the stock market, and how you should be careful, as the slightest slip up could ruin your entire career."
One of those games you can play for hundreds of hours. Can confirm.
"This game is amazing. It's changed my life for the better. Although the community is toxic, as is every gaming community in some ways, it's very minor. The community is welcoming to people who want change, something different to the usual Shoot-em up games.  The game itself is great, graphics are pristine and have a childish yet lovable look to it, and don't get me started on hats.  You can make friends just by finding a good valve server, and just generally have a good time unless a tryhard comes along and ruins it. The classes are diverse, everyone has a role to play so no one gets bored. Taunts are in a variety and if people are bored with the base game they could play another mode like Freak Fortress, Slender fortress, etc. It's overall a great game and recommend it to anyone who feels like the game they're currently frequenting is wearing them out, TF2 is unique. and absolutely refreshes what you think of FPS communities as a whole.  "

"Do you want to wear your cool (coolest ever existed) hat in a game? Do you want to cut, shoot, burn and crash your enemies in pieces? If you do, this game made exatly for you! But if you don't... so what do you live for, man?!"
This game has snipers humpin the air 10/10
"VAC stopped me from smoking crack, still doing it. 11/9"
"I recommend this game because of its never ending fun you can play different gamemodes created by teh community, you can also collect a bunch of items such as hats, miscs, weapons, and some of the items have very cool perks. Like stranges will count how many kills or points you got on that weapon/hat and even come in ranks. then theres the Unusuals the things you would really want they come with effects like, Burning, sunbeams, and even my personal favorite Cloudy moon. Play on more than 100 maps! Don't forget that almost everygame has Achievements and tells you what to do to earn them. This game is even more better on the Holidays! The gamemodes on TF2 are fantastic my favorites are Slender Fortress, Times 10 and Vs Hale you should play them if you get the game and remember Team Fortress 2 is Free to Play!"
i wondring were can you get a 200 slot backpack
"although you can use cash whats so awsome is you can work yourself up without cash. Find items craft them into metal, trade metal for stranges, craft medal craft them into hats, get hats trade them for stranges. 5 OUT OF 5, MUST HAVE GAME"
"Best multiplayer game ever. It's free too. WAY better then call of duty, but if you play call of duty and are used to it. This game takes some skill unlike call of duty :3"
Its a very fun game where u play with friends/bots/players! You can pretty much afk on it troll and stuff. Its very fun.
"I just realized that I have played this game for more than 1K hours and haven't made a recommendation for it so here I am. When I tried this game (first time), the voice of the 'announcer' was so strange I said 'I won't be able to tolerate this voice' so I stopped playing basically right after I started. After like, a year maybe I picketed it up again, thanks to 'GameDay Iroda'. I thought 'why not try it again' and boy, after few hours of struggling with... well any class I fell in love. I wasted few hundred bucks on virtual items since then but you know, I don't mind it. This game gave me so many awesome hours and I still like it, I don't know when it will wear off but one thing is for sure: if you haven't played it already just give it a shot (You can't lose anything since it's F2P)."
Addictive and pulls money from my wallet. Needs more hats and hats.
&gt; be glorious heavy man of the soviet union  &gt; be eating my sandvich  &gt; suddenly blue gibbus spy comes before me and begins to try and taunt kill me  &gt; i move out the way and holiday punch him  &gt; taunt kill him with the fury of gaben at an all you can eat buffet  &gt; dominate him and he calls me a ♥♥♥♥♥♥  &gt; tries to get me banned for griefing  &gt; he calls admin  &gt; admin sees nothing wrong  &gt; blue spy calls admin 'a p**sy a**ed n***er f****t'  &gt; admin bans him for 'abusing the call admin button and for being a b***h'   10 glorious heavies eating sandviches out of 10
changed my review because I played this yesterday for a bit and actually enjoyed it.
Overall its good game for F2P but little P2W... I am not talking about skins right now that´s another part... Valve is not interested in this like game but they are interested in $$....
Thanks for the addiction. Great game goor sir
"Ah TF2, The #1 War Themed Hat Simulator. This game is one of my favorites. I've been playing this since 2013.   Pros   - You get to play as one out of the nine lovable classes - Hats/weapons to customize your classes and playstyle  - Many different ways to play! There are official gamemodes and many community made gamemodes! - The community. I met many friends and very kind people but I also met a handful of pretty nasty people but overall, the community is pretty cool! - This game is 9 years old (at the time I'm writing this) and it's not dead yet! :D - Free to play. People used to play $20 for it before 2011 - VERY addicting -   I find some of the classes attractive. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) (I'm a female)     Neutral   - Updates. I love having new updates but lately, the updates are slowly getting worse. - Balancing. Some stuff are balanced and some are pretty broken/underpowered. - Comp/Casual. I REALLY miss pubs but there's always community servers to play on. I find weird ♥♥♥♥ on there but there are some pretty fun community made gamemodes. Comp/casual isn't that bad. I play it sometimes when I get sick of community servers.   Cons   - Kids. I am 15 when I wrote this review which means I am a kid. What I mean about kids is that most of them are really annoying and very immature. I met a handful of squeakers and kids on this game. I wonder why young kids play this game. They usually like the newer games. - This TF2 vs Overwatch thing. BOTH games can co-exist ya know. - Valve not really listening to the community. Pretty self-explanatory.   Overall, I'd give this game a 9/10."
Good game for first time FPS players like me D:

fix this c r a p valve first competitive match i play there is a hacker and no votekick   what the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ valve?
"I love it. Full of action, tryhards, noobs, pros, cons, and more!   MOAR GUNS AND COSMETICS 4 SNIPER   I love it.  10/10"
One of the best games I ever had on steam. Although the market can be a troll sometimes...
"A very fun FPS for people of all ages! I love it myself, and I'm 14!"
"The most unrealistic, random, crazy, FPS you will ever play. For example, you can slaughter your enemies with ham, eat sandviches, dance in the middle of the battlefield, and most importantly... HATZ!!!  2016 Steam Awards...  'Test of Time'  ...TF2 has been a popular game since the beginning, and still stands up today."
"It's great game to play with friends. For the people who don't like the hats, then ignore them. Don't go trading like a madman. To Gaben: Please release HL3"
medic dies at the end.
"I really like this game because it's fun, and you can decorate your characters: 3 also, good comunnity players"
"I am playing this game only for good trading system. And I love this game. If you want to get good stuff on steam, buy games only 4free you need only a good friend which can gift you a TF2 premium. 10/10 trading simulator 2015"
"10/10, best Hat Simulator."
"This game is AMAZING! The whole nine different class styles brings a whole new way to play fps games whit each class using a new stratergy of gameplay. When people start playing this game they would eventually get bored of the running and shooting but luckily, Tf2 added new weapons with different abilities making the game a bit more challenging but fun. The different gamemodes are also really interesting. All in all, TF2 is a great game and I think a lot of people should play it."
Reasons why you should get tf2.  Conga Hats Throw ♥♥♥♥ on people Pancake recipe Most realistc game ever Hats Decapitation Hit people with a fish Cosmetics Hit yourself with a baseball bat Hats Fight robots Steal integence Conga Strange weapons Festive items Awesome halloween event Crates Hats Stab your friends in the back Flamethrower that shoots rainbows Jump six times Slap people with a grenade killing them but not you Conga Bonk Be a sp00ky spy Sanvich Rocket jump Delfect rocks and grenades Hats Put out fires with flamethrower Deadringer Be a black scottish cyclops   Because I told you to. Seriously do it.  Stop reading this review and do it.  10/10 Would stab my friends in the back again.
I got a pancake recipe from the reviews section   10/10 would pancake again
Started paying about 2-3 years ago. Really cool game. I suggest.
Not as good as it was.
this game is fun to play if u have a strong pc~ Tf2 is fulll of cheaters~ Tf2 is full of gibuses~
This game is 9 years old if it is still alive after this long this should be a sign that people care about tf2
"Really good, fun game with an awesome community. Although recently there was some troubles with a stupid update which just shouldn't have happend they have fixed most issues and it is a great game again."
"Team Fortress 2 is a phenomenal game that everyone should get a chance to play. You can play as 9 classes (Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy) and each class their own unique abilities and weapons that make up what they are. Also, you can play 7 different game modes (Payload, King Of The Hill, Control Points, Attack/Defense, Payload Race, Capture The Flag and Special Delivery.) that have their own unique ways that mixes the gameplay up a little. There's even Mann Vs. Machine, where you play co-op and defend Mann Co. from robots that are just like the regular classes in Team Fortress 2. Not to mention there's a lot more weapons than just the stock weapons. Plus, hats. More hats that you can even imagine.  11/10 Another one of the best multiplayer games out there."
"I would totally recommend this game yes alot of people think tf2 is dead we should just buy overwatch well tf2 isn't dead. It is very fun and addictive to me. A lot of the not recommended reviews are just people complaining about the meet your match update and yes i do understand since valve doesn't really care anymore but tf2 is still 1 of my favourite games to play. Right now i think tf2 isn't dieing it's just not growing and it is still very popular anyway i'm sure the next update will male tf2 great again when we get frontline, Mayan project and Iron gauntlet could save tf2 and get a lot of people to join again.  Anyway I recommend a lot of people to play it is still very fun to play with the 9 classes to choose from."
"Ended up spending almost 1,000 dollars on hats.  10/10"
Zany fun of a team deathmatch fps with the chaotic design of someone high off cow fumes. Lots of idiots on during certain times so be prepared to rage or ragequit like you have never raged before.

A great game.  Don't belive me? Look at how many hours i have spent playing it.
Who needs skill when you have the beggar's?
Use a primitive bow and arrow whilst getting molecularly deconstructed by a laser. Smack people with shovels and fish. Stop and have lunch whilst everyone around you dies. Group up in herds of seven or more snipers for maximum efficiency.   10/10 Would Pay $7 USD To High Five Again
"I can't stop playing. At this point, I'm playing just to increase my hat collection. Knocked out all the achievements, the MVM missions, and have almost 2,000 hours of gametime logged in and I CAN'T STOP. A warning label should be put on this game: 'May cause insomnia, night terrors, anxiousness, irritability, and severe cases of kapelophilia.' When this game finally drives me insane and it will, all people will find is a pile of skin and bones muttering two words over and over, 'More hats.'  10/10"
This has been a great game since I bought it for $20. Valve never has let me down.
It was the best game ive ever played...now the most players are 10 years old kids.
"I just making this review for gay badge  Play it if you want, it's f2p anyway whatever.."
"Team Fortress 2 is the best game ever made, its engaging, eccentric and just generally insane. I recommend it to EVERYONE!!!! Download it now! "
the best that ever was
fun for hours
THIS IS THE BEST F THE BEST :) Thanks Valve for making this
"If I worked for IGN, I would give this game a 10/10.  Gameplay balance is perfect, so many things to unlock.  Lord gabe, give me pan #84 please"
"6/10  Proxy  stars Pros: -For a game made 10 years ago, it still is one of the most played games on Steam -Semi-moddable -A cast of unique characters -Variety of weapons and comestics -Variety of maps -Still supported -Good for achievement hunters Cons: This game has fallen greatly from grace imo. -Toxic community(Binds spammers, hackers, rude people...) -Updates: You get like one update every six months that add little to nothing to the game -Very few people actually working on the game -Hackers in casual and competitive -Very little communication from Valve to the community -Everything that is hyped for ends up being a huge disappointment -Removed pubs / Meet Your Match update(Nuff said) -Some bugs that should've been fixed long ago  Overall: Not recommended at current state, there was once a time where I would've recommended the game. Good times... good times..."
This is my favoutite game :D   10/10 :3
"OMG i love this Game I have played this game Since 2009 I just create diffrent profiles and this game is Amazing This game is 100% cool it is creative and Fun Thx Gaben Newell I love all of Ur Games this is the best game ever It has Diffrent Gamemodes if u Havent tried it Out u should Cause this Game is cool u can find Items Sometime u can find items if u pre-own a game u can get cool things u can go to the community Market and get things And Tf2 Has Halloween Events and u can find Boxes to get cool Halloween things on Christmas u get cool stuff when u are on it There are 9 Classes There are soilder,scout,pyro Then heavy,engineer,DemoMan Then Medic,sniper,spy My favorite Class is the engineer he is Defense u can build sentrys dispensers and teleporters :) :3 ! This Game Is Still Great And It's Legacy Will Forever Be Remebered Thanks!"
"  While people may say that the community is cancer and the game is dying, with the new Smissmas autobalance and rematch changes the game is much better. While that doesn't change the community, the game is still fun and if you aren't playing the game because of the community, then you should just ignore the community and play the game!  Also addressing the Overwatch vs. TF2 debate, i'm not sure why people are comparing the two as they are very different games. They may have many of the same gamemodes, but both of them are different in very many ways. Overwatch is a lot more competitive game, being having you play the objective more. I am not saying you cannot have fun in overwatch but I see the game as more serious and direct game than messing around in TF2. Of course I am very biased towards TF2 as I have played it for a long time, but really, it all depends on the type of game you want to play and if you are willing to spend money on a game.  As i'm typing more about debates about other games and TF2, and not a review any more, ima just end this. Pls tho, stop the war between Overwatch and TF2."
"This is a classic! The first game i have ever played on Steam and probably the first game i actually enjoy playing with. You should try this game too because it's free right? :) I really respect that the TF team is still updating the game even if the update isn't perfect it's better than nothing..  9 different classes. Lots of loot. Lots of gamemodes  Lots of hats/cosmetics  Aaand just incredibly good.  After 1,500 hours played i think i can safely say that it's a great game P.S.   Sorry for my bad english ^^  "
"Been playing this game for the past 3 years and I must say, this game made me meet many good friends whom i still play games with on steam today. In terms of trading, I wouldn't say its bad but still there is room for improvement. The economy has been going down hill since 2012 because of the non-stop rise of keys. Encourage to play the game but not go into trading. Its losing popularity but hey, it was fun while it lasted  Side note: OVERWATCH FOR POOR PEOPLE XD"
"One of my favorite games, I keep coming back to it."
best game 10 out of 10
it's alright
"Dear friends, Team Fortress 2 is one of the best FPS that I've ever played. I love it because it is so creative. It many ways it is different to Quake or Counter Strike. I would greatly recommend this game!"
"I just making this review for gay badge  Play it if you want, it's f2p anyway whatever.."
"Didn't take very long for me to get addicted to this game. This is my favorite game right now and I strongly recommend it if you're new to the FPS genre or like cartoonish sort of animations. Do check out Team Fortress Two, I love it so much I sound like an advertiser."
It was the best game ive ever played...now the most players are 10 years old kids.
"This new update made this game so... Souless. I dont really know how to put it in words, but it just isnt fun anymore."
THIS IS THE BEST F THE BEST :) Thanks Valve for making this
ABOUT THIS GAME  i like this game it the frist game i join this steam community and i play it the most  it a multiplayer game and i love that   GAME POSITIVE THINKING I think this game is the original game for co op game in steam  NEGATIVE THINKING but sometime this game is hard to play because it lag i dont know is it because of my computer
very fun game with hats
"Really good, fun game with an awesome community. Although recently there was some troubles with a stupid update which just shouldn't have happend they have fixed most issues and it is a great game again."
"  This game is great, good for the people that aren't willing to pay any money on games (also good for those who are willing to spend money on games), but also want one, its cute, the characters are funny, optimized pretty well, there are so many different ways to play each and every class, so theres lots of variety. All around a great game!"
After 1700 hours on this game i can say: Its a good game.   1699 of those hours were me dying.  1 hour was me killing little kids  10/10 - IGN
"My favorite game on steam! 10/10 would play again! Great, fun, addicting game with 9 different classes WOW 9 CLASSSESSEWESESES"
Tf2 is a first person shooter game. You can play with people around the world (Casual) and team up with many people against robots (MVM).  There are many rules/guidelines in tf2: 1. Never bother a range or angry players. 2. If there is a tryhard or people that are hacking try to kill/put a stop to them. If not they will rule the tf2 community. 3. Never kill/ underestimate f2p people who is having their first match in TF2. Try to make them understand about this Physics War Game Called Team Fotress 2. 4. Never kill friendly hoovies or friendly players who doesn't want to fight or kill people. 5. Have Fun  Reminder: You don't need to kill players or play the game to have fun That is just my tips.
"Great game. Worth playing for the people, the places and what they have in store in the future. One of the best free Valve games out there ( other than Dota 2) You should try it and maybe you might like it"
0/10 Copied Overwatch. Literally unplayable.
"i played it some hours, it's great. 11/10"

"As a person who has over one thousand (1,000 +) hours in this game , i feel like nothing changed . . . except the fun of the game , the game itself is a very nice piece of art that everybody wants to see , but after looking at it for a while , you realise that it changes to worse are , just like you look at Mona lisa , if you will stand in front of it for a while, you will realise how disgusting this painting actually is , this game was awesome , like 2 yeras ago , now this game is pretty much dead , prices are dead, community is dead , i remember when youtube was FULL of community made videos , like : thoeries , easter eggs , references from one class to one another etc. etc... but now... it's all dead there are some new updates from time to time .. but... whatever it's not the same , after the Gun Mettle update , this game changed , by saying changed , i mean broke , everything broke , the new taunts was something new and it wouldn't be bad if they were like the old ones , you know.. the ones who had something in them , like the magical spell who makes them a TF2 taunts , right ? and the guns... oohh the guns , you remember when the game was like , candy , cute , funny , deadly fun game ? it was kinda sarcastic that dead was going in pair with candies , fun and other things iek tjhat , just look at the pyro with his pink baloonicorn flying behind him while he was burning people to death , IT WAS FUN !!! there is no such a things now ( i mean the new things like that ) coming back to the topic , the guns just didn't go in pair with the old ones that you know ( cute little , pink... you know.. ) they were... diffrent , tottaly no curse what so ever . I love tf2 , and all of this time spent with my best friends ,was the best time in my life ( don't get me wrong , im really sad person ) but it really was , now , i wouldn't say the same , everyone play other games like Overwatch , Counter strike , Unturned and other games , like our group , pack of friends just popped out everywhere , just like bag of crisps , when a fat kid opens it and ever crisp/chip lands on a floor and he cries"

"Best hat simulator, hands down Waste your money and the life savings on pixels "
"Team Fortress 2 is a classic. The game is fun, colourful, energetic and very unique. The classes are all very whimsical and charming as well as bringing something unique to combat.  However with some of the recent updates and Valve not always listening it has lost a bit of its lustre. Also, the community is not very nice to newer players, often giving them a hard time or exploiting their unaware status.   Overall if you just continue to keep playing and learning this game will give you hours of fun. I implore newer players to keep playing until they feel familiar just so they can see everything there is to offer. For older and returning players I can't force you to come back but hopefully, Valve will fix their ♥♥♥♥ soon.  "

"TF2 is all about fun, it's hard not to have fun while playing. Seriously, this game is maddeningly addictive.   There are quite a few game modes and just one of them can keep me entertained for a long time. Hell, my favorite game mode is MvM and almost 1/3 my play time is from it alone.   Each and every one of the 9 classes in TF2 have their own unique personality which gives them a charming feel and makes them seem like actual people instead of faceless soldiers. They all have voice lines that crack me up just because of how stupidly they can be used. In how many games will you see a Soldier with a rocket launcher shooting up the enemy as he continues to THANK them?   There are tons of unlockable weapon combinations and each weapon offers its own special set of stats to keep the experience of killing your target refreshing.   The only problem I have with this game is with most of the community (especially the MvM community). I can't stand the toxic attitude so commonly found within this virtual hat simulator. However, looking past the losers, I have met some truly great people in this game which have further helped my enjoyment of the game.  Overall, this game is a crazy blast of fun, wacky proportions and is absolutely worth installing (for free!) and checking out. It is amazing to think that I can still find fun in a game that I have clocked over 7,000+ hours into. The one-of-a-kind experience I have had with TF2 is what makes it my favorite online video game."

"Don't know anything about Team Fortress 2? Sit down and let me ask you something.  Ever been weak and small, but fearless? Wanna twice as fast and jump twice as high as you ever could before and cave in skulls with a bat as you laugh as the people who once dominated you now crying in pain at your feet? Wanna become a Force of Nature? Play Scout.  Ever wanted to fly using a rocket launcher or use a shovel to give a hippie a haircut then dig his grave? Wanna become the hero no one thinks they want but everyone needs? Play Soldier.  Ever been misunderstood by your peers and shamed for being bad at what you do? Wanna slow-roast them and watch as they burn before your very eyes and rainbows spray out of their corpse? Want to become the underdog that wins it all in the end? Play Pyro.  Do you have a physical or mental impairment that everyone thought would stop you from achieving your goals? Are you sure that nothing and nobody can stop you from blowing everybody away. Want to literally blow them away then enjoy a swig of cheap whiskey? (Or maybe just become a drunk Samurai?) Play Demoman.  Ever been considered a nerd to people? Fat and quiet, a person who no one would even consider trying to understand? Have people ever made fun fo your weight, hobbies, interests or knowledge? Why not drive their live savings worth of bullets back into their vital organs? Play Heavy.  Have you worked your whole life to achieve something ground-breaking? On your way, have people put you down and told you that you're useless? Or to stop building your way to the top? Use your dreams and inventions to kill your enemies. And if they try to destroy your works? Hit them with a wrench. Play Engineer.  Do people say that you're good at being nice, but think that you can't fight for yourself? Do they brag about how much stronger they are than you and that you could never beat them if you tried? Slice through somebody's heart with a saw as those arrogant friends of yours cry for your help. Play Medic.  Have people ever mocked you for being different and not conforming to society? Do people find it strange that you're independent and plan your own efficient way to deal with problems. Since you can't cram your wisdom through their thick skulls, shoot a 3-inch bullet through their heads instead, then throw your urine at them. Play Sniper.  Does your computer run at -3 FPS with a broken 1GB memory card? Do you enjoy having sex with women, leaving them with the son you had together, and then 20 years later, killing him by literally stabbing him in the back? In fact, don't you just love stabbing people in the back and killing them in the most unfair way possible, slowly destroying their machines that they poured their blood, sweat and tears into and instantly ridding them of the 100% Uber that they worked so hard to get. Don't you love getting a good laugh out of it afterwards even though you were just camping in a corner for ten minutes waiting for them?

Are you French (not that anything is wrong with that)? Play Spy (just kidding, get ♥♥♥♥ed up your ♥♥♥ with a rusty pipe)!  But, really though. Let's be serious. Team Fortress 2 is a great co-op/multiplayer game! There are so many different classes, weapons, game modes, maps and hats to choose from and after 9 years, the game is still in it's prime. Just getting into the game maybe take some time to get used to, but with time, you'll become an amazing player and find what you like the most (even if, God forbid, you main Spy).

"Just awesome and Free! - 2013  Still not tired of it - 2016  ah overwatch came out, well..."
"My favorite game on steam! 10/10 would play again! Great, fun, addicting game with 9 different classes WOW 9 CLASSSESSEWESESES"
dis game is bad i always get kicked for ''hacking'' ♥♥♥♥ing f2p's
"its a fun game i recommend it, but its not really what im looking for but it is a great fun"
The best hat simulator I've seen in decades.
"As a person who has over one thousand (1,000 +) hours in this game , i feel like nothing changed . . . except the fun of the game , the game itself is a very nice piece of art that everybody wants to see , but after looking at it for a while , you realise that it changes to worse are , just like you look at Mona lisa , if you will stand in front of it for a while, you will realise how disgusting this painting actually is , this game was awesome , like 2 yeras ago , now this game is pretty much dead , prices are dead, community is dead , i remember when youtube was FULL of community made videos , like : thoeries , easter eggs , references from one class to one another etc. etc... but now... it's all dead there are some new updates from time to time .. but... whatever it's not the same , after the Gun Mettle update , this game changed , by saying changed , i mean broke , everything broke , the new taunts was something new and it wouldn't be bad if they were like the old ones , you know.. the ones who had something in them , like the magical spell who makes them a TF2 taunts , right ? and the guns... oohh the guns , you remember when the game was like , candy , cute , funny , deadly fun game ? it was kinda sarcastic that dead was going in pair with candies , fun and other things iek tjhat , just look at the pyro with his pink baloonicorn flying behind him while he was burning people to death , IT WAS FUN !!! there is no such a things now ( i mean the new things like that ) coming back to the topic , the guns just didn't go in pair with the old ones that you know ( cute little , pink... you know.. ) they were... diffrent , tottaly no curse what so ever . I love tf2 , and all of this time spent with my best friends ,was the best time in my life ( don't get me wrong , im really sad person ) but it really was , now , i wouldn't say the same , everyone play other games like Overwatch , Counter strike , Unturned and other games , like our group , pack of friends just popped out everywhere , just like bag of crisps , when a fat kid opens it and ever crisp/chip lands on a floor and he cries"
"TF2 is a game where you shoot at the enemies and they shoot back. The question is which one of you will survive.  In all honesty, the game is free, so give it a try.  Obviosly, the game has tons of problems regarding communication between the devs and the community. The lack of constent updates nowadays is also a bit frustrating. And what upddates that we DO get unfortunately are lack-luster and are usually riddled with bugs and contraversy. Yeah, the game isn't what it used to be, but I'd still say it's worth giving a go if you are new to TF2. I mean, it's free, so what do you have to lose?"
"wasd scout x10 + space x20 gives you arthritis. Getting back stabbed sometimes gives heart attacks, but the person giving them is the frenchy French fry toast man. Heavy is slow af with a gun that mows the lawn. Soldier is a very good fun and hard to play class that is the best all around the whole 9 classes - soldier main. Pyro is hot af and flame throwers are like...nvm, that class is evil. Demo is mainly spam and pink slime. Engineer is build legos that come alive waiting to be stepped on. Medic is heal man that can be ultra heal man with his ghost buster toaster. Sniper is op if aim is Kim possible. Hats are nice to have but irrelevant. Taunts too. Unusuals are double rainbows. Comp tf is nice if you want to get competitive. As in try, strat, plan, and all the wonky wonder mind skill stuff. TF2 doesn't die, you die."
This game sucked the life out of me and my wallet
Hey tf2 was my favourite game for a long time and probably still is. but this game could be 1000 times better if the dev team get there act together and actualy help the game. the game is very good but loses its spice after a while if u dont play competative or have a bunch of friends to play with :D. also the community is well mixed but some of the memes are funny :D
Team Fortress 2 is a great game with a lot of diverse gamplay. I would recommend it to all
"I have yet to log as many hours into other games as I have for TF2. The developpers continue to inject new life and new content on a regular basis. In my opinion, TF2 is a fantastic team-based shooter which has set a new bar for the delivery of user-made content."
"Don't know anything about Team Fortress 2? Sit down and let me ask you something.  Ever been weak and small, but fearless? Wanna twice as fast and jump twice as high as you ever could before and cave in skulls with a bat as you laugh as the people who once dominated you now crying in pain at your feet? Wanna become a Force of Nature? Play Scout.  Ever wanted to fly using a rocket launcher or use a shovel to give a hippie a haircut then dig his grave? Wanna become the hero no one thinks they want but everyone needs? Play Soldier.  Ever been misunderstood by your peers and shamed for being bad at what you do? Wanna slow-roast them and watch as they burn before your very eyes and rainbows spray out of their corpse? Want to become the underdog that wins it all in the end? Play Pyro.  Do you have a physical or mental impairment that everyone thought would stop you from achieving your goals? Are you sure that nothing and nobody can stop you from blowing everybody away. Want to literally blow them away then enjoy a swig of cheap whiskey? (Or maybe just become a drunk Samurai?) Play Demoman.  Ever been considered a nerd to people? Fat and quiet, a person who no one would even consider trying to understand? Have people ever made fun fo your weight, hobbies, interests or knowledge? Why not drive their live savings worth of bullets back into their vital organs? Play Heavy.  Have you worked your whole life to achieve something ground-breaking? On your way, have people put you down and told you that you're useless? Or to stop building your way to the top? Use your dreams and inventions to kill your enemies. And if they try to destroy your works? Hit them with a wrench. Play Engineer.  Do people say that you're good at being nice, but think that you can't fight for yourself? Do they brag about how much stronger they are than you and that you could never beat them if you tried? Slice through somebody's heart with a saw as those arrogant friends of yours cry for your help. Play Medic.  Have people ever mocked you for being different and not conforming to society? Do people find it strange that you're independent and plan your own efficient way to deal with problems. Since you can't cram your wisdom through their thick skulls, shoot a 3-inch bullet through their heads instead, then throw your urine at them. Play Sniper.  Does your computer run at -3 FPS with a broken 1GB memory card? Do you enjoy having sex with women, leaving them with the son you had together, and then 20 years later, killing him by literally stabbing him in the back? In fact, don't you just love stabbing people in the back and killing them in the most unfair way possible, slowly destroying their machines that they poured their blood, sweat and tears into and instantly ridding them of the 100% Uber that they worked so hard to get.

"Now I can easily share my virtual hats with the world, and kill tiny coward with my balogna!"
"TF2 is all about fun, it's hard not to have fun while playing. Seriously, this game is maddeningly addictive.   There are quite a few game modes and just one of them can keep me entertained for a long time. Hell, my favorite game mode is MvM and almost 1/3 my play time is from it alone.   Each and every one of the 9 classes in TF2 have their own unique personality which gives them a charming feel and makes them seem like actual people instead of faceless soldiers. They all have voice lines that crack me up just because of how stupidly they can be used. In how many games will you see a Soldier with a rocket launcher shooting up the enemy as he continues to THANK them?   There are tons of unlockable weapon combinations and each weapon offers its own special set of stats to keep the experience of killing your target refreshing.   The only problem I have with this game is with most of the community (especially the MvM community). I can't stand the toxic attitude so commonly found within this virtual hat simulator. However, looking past the losers, I have met some truly great people in this game which have further helped my enjoyment of the game.  Overall, this game is a crazy blast of fun, wacky proportions and is absolutely worth installing (for free!) and checking out. It is amazing to think that I can still find fun in a game that I have clocked over 7,000+ hours into. The one-of-a-kind experience I have had with TF2 is what makes it my favorite online video game."
Enjoy hat / weapon trading games with tons of different items? GET THIS Want a game that ppl actually play for the fun? Find something else.
"So...I actually got to uninstall TF2 completely (already did a few months ago). Some updates actually ruined the game very much. (Meet your match *cough*) The community can sux sometimes,especially if there are people with gibuses or pyrovision glasses. So I will just end this by simply quitting it and leaving this review here. I don't have anything else to write here,but that's it for now.  Have a nice day. "
This is a fun free to play game which sets a precedent for all free to play games to follow its model The addictive classes gameplay have had my entertained for years. Updates are long between and often underwhelming however.

"Great game, funny stuff, that's all you really need to know about it. Also, don't w+m1 or I will hunt you down"
"This game made my year a great one. my only problem with this game is that its not 'Free To Play' as to get more space for your backpack you need to pay money for it which is kinda irritating. Another issue I have is its ADDITICTING, I always map out my TF2 wish list with the hats/Cosmetics I want everytime a new bunch comes out. For begginers I recomond about 50 hours of tf2 before you want to become Pay To Play. I also recomond puting in some break in between milestones. I like doing a 1 to 4 week break every 500 or 400 hours are played. Tf2 is a great experince for everyone whos new to the fps genere! "
"If I worked for IGN, I would give this game a 10/10.  Gameplay balance is perfect, so many things to unlock.  Lord gabe, give me pan #84 please"
"6/10  Proxy  stars Pros: -For a game made 10 years ago, it still is one of the most played games on Steam -Semi-moddable -A cast of unique characters -Variety of weapons and comestics -Variety of maps -Still supported -Good for achievement hunters Cons: This game has fallen greatly from grace imo. -Toxic community(Binds spammers, hackers, rude people...) -Updates: You get like one update every six months that add little to nothing to the game -Very few people actually working on the game -Hackers in casual and competitive -Very little communication from Valve to the community -Everything that is hyped for ends up being a huge disappointment -Removed pubs / Meet Your Match update(Nuff said) -Some bugs that should've been fixed long ago  Overall: Not recommended at current state, there was once a time where I would've recommended the game. Good times... good times..."
"This is a classic! The first game i have ever played on Steam and probably the first game i actually enjoy playing with. You should try this game too because it's free right? :) I really respect that the TF team is still updating the game even if the update isn't perfect it's better than nothing..  9 different classes. Lots of loot. Lots of gamemodes  Lots of hats/cosmetics  Aaand just incredibly good.  After 1,500 hours played i think i can safely say that it's a great game P.S.   Sorry for my bad english ^^  "

Great Community!!!
This game is perfect.
The best free to play game on steam I have played so far   a good way to start playing fps games on pc
"About time I wrote something about this one.  Basically, TF2 is one of the best multiplayer first-person shooters out there without exaggerating. Lots of weapons, great maps, diverse classes, fair F2P system, continuous updates, casual and mostly friendly community, relatively balanced, you name it. Hell, it even has still-growing lore behind it. The game used to have an amazing artstyle to boot, but with the huge amount of cosmetics added, that's kind of starting to fade. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, mind you.  It's probably one of those games you HAVE to try at some point. Chances are, you'll sink at least 50 hours into it."

"Now in this game, you play as John Stamos, an actor who was on full house. He sucked too much ♥♥♥♥ and died. waitwaitwait, theres more. Then your soul fuses with ♥♥♥♥♥tron, and you become Don Cheadle. One day you discover your one true love, Teenage mutant ninja rats (betcha thought i was gonna say turtles you gay arab). You decide to write fan fiction for the show and post it to fakku, the world's largest supply of cocaine and hentai. After getting a lot of reveiws based on how good the fanfics were at sexing the rats, you retire and enjoy rolling in your gay hentai money. You marry your one other true love, Charlie Sheen. You give him all your cocaine supply and he says 'Thanks m8' and leaves you because your black. After 20 billliongagillion years, you hang yourself and die.  Then you download and play Team Fortress 2. I rate this game, (2/17) 'Not bad' - Liam Wolf (some gay kid)"
"This is a truely amazing game! It has great gameplay, amazing animations, and very well thought game modes. Although this game doesn't add weapons very often, it does add many thousands of hats which look quite snazzy on your classes. And the weapons they do add are always a delight (except the quikiebomb launcher). Although there are a few random bugs here and there, this game is almost flawless. 9/10"
"Team Fortress 2. A cartoon first person shooter based on team red vs. team blue. Weather your playing alone on practice mode, playing with your friends on co-op mann vs. machine, or playing against your friends on capture the flag or king of the hill, this game's fun and comedic story line will surely leave you wanting more!"
so cool playing with ur friends and u will have so much fun :D
THIS GAMEM ROCKS AND YOU SHOULD TRY TEAM FORTRESS CLASSIC ITS GREAT
This game is great!
team fortress was a very good play
it's a so exciting game n i love it.
Overwatch rip off   (Lazy pieces of ♥♥♥♥)
Playtime (hours): 6.1 last two weeks  it's time to let go matchmaking flopped let's move on
It's like Team Fortress 2 with hats and bread is the yeast of your concerns
"Team Fortress 2 is an team, class based game, you can play as 2 teams (RED, BLU), the graphics is cartoon, familar for peoples who like cartoon. You can play as 9 classes, move out the battlefield and fight.  Help your team to move to cart, capture the control point... Then at the end, your team will win, or not.   But that's not all, its not done yet, community did make fun of this game, by starting servers with custom gamemodes, like Surf, Jump,... And many more custom maps.  You can wear cosmetics, taunt with your teammates. Every big update, the game got funnier and better. I recommend this game for players who is looking some thing to play. And who want to try some thing new, Team Fortress 2 is an good choice for you, and also free to play.  Rating: 10/10 - Fun alot, spends years to play."
"The game can make people angry sometimes but you can be able to do many things example you're able to customize your character putting hats,misc,book,canteens,and or taunts. The game can also let you pretty much break the laws of gravity. It has a good story about 2 brothers fighting for their father's land *Continued*(To read more go to  www.teamfortress.com)  Sometimes people may be negative to eachother with this game because of its unrealistic ways and how its not 'COD Related' if you play this game you'd know that people are more nice and easy in the game.Sometimes people would hate you for being a F2P(Free 2 Play) But you can just buy premium of course but to this very day they don't screw with F2P because they know underestimation is a bad move.The classes have their own ways for example the Heavy is a defense character he may be slow but his minigun can do hell of a damage.The game sometimes may make crossover hats like the Alien...... I forgot the name theres the Awesomenauts Badge and countless others coming soon and will be in your inventory sooner or later.There are many more reasons why I recommend this game but i'm kind of new to this game there may be other reasons why people would love to play this game besides from the reasons.   AGGH THIS GAME SUCKS!!! -Cod Kids  When a COD kid rages you people will most likely be there xd who wouldn't   Get.The.Game."

Totally Amazing Game - Do play &amp; become pay too play !
"well... i love tf2 realy i do but... after the summer update and the meet your match update everythings gone wrong. what happened to the classic tf2 that everyone loved?.  i thought that this year, the halloween will be much better then halloween 2015 but i was wrong, their are no big changes then the lest year except some new maps and new cosmetics, all the other are just like lest year. if their is one thing that im sure about it is that gaben stop take responsible on tf2 anymore. so sad. :("
"This game has something for everyone, there are friendly servers, silly servers, ect for people like me who enjoy a fun and more layed back experience. For those who play the game for what it is there are the pubs, I honestly say the experience depends on your team and teamwork. While I can say the game has its flaws and it is annoying to see all those weapons and hats but not having the money to afford it, I can say with confidence that this game is one of the best out there. The perfect blend of silliness and seriousness makes it just perfect. I've met a lot of good friends through this game and I'm meeting more everyday. So please give this game a chance, dispite what people say about the updates and stuff, at its core Team Fortress 2 is a game that should be enjoyed. Weather you're laughing with friends or raging at that spy that just took out your entire team, this game is sure to bring you years of fun.   With Love, The Team Fortress 2 Community"
"I've spent a lot of time and money on this game, it's pretty good and if you want to throw away your life to endlessly collect hats then by all means jump on aboard my friend, you've got lots to learn.  also gaben, still waiting to unbox an unusual.. still waiting.."
New update ruined it.
"I would recommend this one to everyone. Lots of laughs. Seems that there's a lot of people playing it. Free to play unless you like to spend money and have what many others can't afford.   As for myself? I'm starting to stay away from F2P/P2P games. It's not worth the time to me anymore. Box it and I'll buy it, if, it has SP for it. I want to learn a game before I jump into multiplayer."
In short: The first PVP shooter that made me laugh instead of rage.
"  Great game, great community. Not much else to it."
"Welcome..  To Steams' local Kiddy-Pool.    Tf2 had an opportunity (acheived for a short time) to be great,  Now it's just spoiled children and the mentally-impared that inhabit the servers."
"This Game is Very Fun, when you play this, you are gonna love it, i know what im saying and also is FREE :3 just Download it"
Hearts.     .. And hats with hearts.  ...... And taunts with hearts.  .........hearts....
"Team Fortress 2 with an abbreviation of TF2. It has been one of my favourite games out there in the industry. I personally think that this game has a lot of variety in gamemodes, weapons, and just everything in general. I have watched it grow since 2012 and took a break for maybe one or two years and I look to see a bunch of new things. What else can TF2 add? It can add everything and will add everything. Good job TF2."
"You may have killed me, but my hat is better."
This is so great game for me
I need a hero I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night He's gotta be strong And he's gotta be fast And he's gotta be fresh from the fight I need a hero
its good
Hats.... weapons. ..... funny dialogs...... fun gameplay..... and hats ....         G8 m8 would r8 dis 8/8 m8 cuz itz gr8. .. no h8                             I DON'T REGRET ANYTHING!!!!
"This game is all about hats, guns and taunts. TF2 is for f2p and p2p. for p2p now the hat drops is back but not for f2p ;-;  if you are p2p you should respect even gibus! "
Simply the best.   Edit 27/08/2016: This review is officially one year old.
"This game is now ♥♥♥♥. I remember when this game was actually fun, but now it's all about ♥♥♥♥♥♥ memes and crappy youtubers. One of the greatest things about thyis game was trading. This game is quite literally going to go into a financial crash because of the inflation of the keys. I mean when I started trading keys were only 4 REF, 4 REF. At the time of writing this review, keys are worth 17 REF. Valve really need to get their ♥♥♥♥ together because this is unacceptable. Websites like backpack.tf should not exist because they are destroying tf2's economy. Don't waste your time with this piece of ♥♥♥♥.  Please be civil in the comments."
This Game is so addictive and fun

"Team Fortress 2 will probably go down in history as one of my favorite childhood games.  The fact that it was easily obtainable, and how I introduced a bunch of my friends, all of which said they loved it ever since."
"I've had the Team Fortress 2 for about a week now, and I'm thoroughly pleased with the product and the quality of the espresso it can make. I upgraded from a simpler Team Fortress and a separate burr grinder, and one of the attractive features of the Team Fortress 2 was the integrated grinder. The other thing that appealed to me was the ability to adjust lots of features.  In the first few days, I experimented a lot with grind fineness (it can grind VERY fine - I'm quite pleased with the grinding function), the amount of grounds, and how hard I tamped the grounds. These three things, along with the amount of water (pre-programmed or manually controlled) can affect the extraction of the espresso. Since I like to obsess over coffee, I was quite happy to spend a few days figuring out just the right balance of these various things. My partner, however, was quite agitated that she couldn't simply make a decent espresso like we had been able to do with our previous Team Fortress. If you're impatient and don't like to experiment, this might not be the Team Fortress for you. However, after a few days I have now made some of the most delicious espresso I've ever drunk, and certainly the most delicious espresso I've ever made at home.  Initially, we had problems with the pressure. The gauge never went past 'pre-infusion' stage, into the ideal espresso extraction range. The espresso came out too runny and had little to no crema. Even at the finest setting, filling the portafilter as much as possible and tamping as hard I could, I couldn't get that gauge to get above the pre-infusion stage. If this happens (or has happened) to you, don't give up, just read on here. I called Valve and got great customer service. I was told to test the pressure so that we'd know if the Team Fortress was defective or if I could adjust things to get the outcome I wanted. They had me use the single-walled, single-cup filter basket, insert the cleaning disk (a rubber disk that comes with the unit), and then fill the portafilter with foil. This would essentially block the basket and allow the pressure to rise. Then I hit the single espresso shot. After 3 or 4 times of this, the pressure went into the gray (espresso extraction) range, so we knew the Team Fortress was okay. But my next few shots of espresso still came out liquidy with hardly any crema.  Here's what I now do to get a delicious cup of caramel colored, sweet, thick espresso with a beautiful crema: I set the grinder to grind espresso that's the consistency of table salt (as Valve recommends), then I manually grind a bit of espresso into the portafilter, tap it on the counter a few times to settle the grounds (do NOT tamp in between - this will create air pockets), grind some more, tap some more, and so on, until the fourth time I finally have enough grounds in the portafilter that I can then tamp. In my experience, this technique compacts the grounds enough to remove the air space, and now the pressure gauge enters the proper region and I'm quite often able to make a fantastic espresso.  If you're not a perfectionist, you can still make a decent espresso with this Team Fortress, but I probably wouldn't bother spending the money. You can get a Team Fortress for $150 and a burr grinder for $100 and still make a good cup. But if you want an excellent cup and you don't want to spend over $1000, then this Team Fortress (and a little experimentation) will do the trick.  The Team Fortress 2 is well engineered, well made, has lots of things you can adjust (grind fineness, grind amount, water amount, water temperature, pre-set or manual shot length), and looks nice besides. I'm quite happy with my purchase. And even though my partner was initially impatient and started questioning whether this was a good purchase, she's now a convert and is quite happy to have delicious espresso at home."
"Start off as red shpy Notice your team is all F2P Go boxtrot on the point literally no one of your team goes to Sit down Enemy tries to cap, doesnt work Sit still for 5 minutes while laughing your ♥♥♥ off and watching them rage in chat Call in a friend on Steam Let him join your team and go pyro Kill entire team Win  10/10 would be part of map again"
best f2p game:-) and people even spend more money into it than into buying a game
you ever have a puppy that you just really love to play with and then it grows up and ♥♥♥♥♥ all over the place and chews your belongings? this is team fortress 2. was a good game before the gun mettle update. now i cant wait for overwatch. tf2 didnt used to be a pay to win but it is now. dont support this ♥♥♥♥.
"I can neither confirm, nor deny, that this game is fun and is worth your time."
It's ummm... it's good
This game is about the tip of Source engine.With so much personality in it`s gameplay and characters and with such a huge skill cap you will love this game.10/10 Best hat simulator on the market
This Game is 75% off for the Summer Steam Sale of 2015.
"I LOVE THIS GAAAAAAME!!!!!!!!!  I kinda don't like F2Ps (especially wm1 pyros, THEY CAN KISS THEIR ASSES GOODBYE)  P2Ps are alrighty (Apart from the jerk ones with a ton of unusuals and patronizing binds)  overall, GOOD GAME!!!!  call of duty pesants, go back to the corner of society, morons."
"fun game.  except soldier, soldier is cancer"
İts Change my life
It suddenly uninstalled wtf
"This game is amazing! 9 classes, tons of servers (Most are good) and of  course hats.Those are some of the things that make this game awesome. This game will last you a pretty long time.Plus its free!"
A scottish black man killing a Russian with an high explosive grenade launcher and then dancing like there is no tommorow.  10/10 will rekt again
for the badge
Great game.  10/10  Love it
"The game is werry, werry fun, and you can play it even on the shitiest computers, and i had a blast playing 900 h. But 1 little tip for yall, dont waste too much money on it, before u know it, ull buy a new game and forget about tf2, but overall great game."
If this game doesn't give you a hat fetish idk what will...
"This game is great. Despite the fact it has been on steam for over 9 years, it still has an active community and is still being updated to this day. You do get some limitations if you dont buy something off the store but all you need is £0.33 and you can get premium and deny those restrictions. This game has 9 different classes with their own different types of play styles and many different ways of playing them. This game needs teamwork too. While there arent many medics on public servers usually they are key to survival. But you dont need a medic to win. For example the engineer can build many buildings to assist his fellow mercenaries. Finally dont be afraid to use the microphone. While there may be an odd ♥♥♥♥ or two there will always be 10 more nice people out there. This game has a very friendly community with the odd ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but you can simply leave and join another server. I highly recommend this game and it is essential for any steam libary."
This is a pretty good game. Something about hats.
"I learnt Hungarian playing this game. 10/10, köcsög."
"THIS GAME IS EPIC, if youre looking for an amazing first person shooter this is the best! I am almost 2k hours into this game and I have yet to be bored."
10/10 would ignore studying again.
Team Fortress 2 used to be my favorite game. Its sad that I may have to say goodbye to it. Please fix this game valve
"You know a game is bad when it is free to play and I still cant recommend playing it. For some reference, I have 963 hours in this game, and I have been playing it since probably around 2012(over 4 years at the time of writing this), and I have seen the game go from pretty good, to decent, to bad, to worse. Before I get started, I would like to give a heads up to the reader that this is a long review. If you don't want to read the whole thing, I'll give you a short list summarizing the problems with the game below.  -long matchmaking queues -you aren't matched with players of equal skill -bad framerate as a result of poor optimization -bad graphics  -lots of little kids -updates are rare nowadays, and are low quality -devs don't care about the game -no audio custimization whatsoever -ingame economy is dead -not many bugs, but the ones that are there are pronounced and do a lot to ruin the game   Now to get on with the review:    This game hasn't been in a good state for years, but up until recently, it was at least a decent game considering it is free. That's not the case anymore. In an update(Called 'Meet your Match'), about a month ago, the developers(Valve) completely ruined the game. Now, instead of being able to join any server you pleased, you are now forced through their broken matchmaking system. Initially, I welcomed the MM(matchmaking) system. I wanted to be able to join games fast and be matched with players of equal skill. Unfortunately, MM lacks any of this, despite it being adveritized as such. Queue times are annoyingly long, taking a few minutes to find a match. This may not sound like a huge deal, but it is, considering the whole point of the update was to be able to automatically find a match fast. Why wait upwards of a minute to find a match when I could have found one in 5 seconds by using the server browser before the update?  I also should mention that the teams are completely unbalanced in MM. 90% of games you either stomp the enemy team because they are noobs or the enemy team stomps you because you were matched with noobs. According to the MM update, you were supposed to be matched with and against players of equal skill, but that isn't the case. There was also a new competitive mode added to the game. Too bad you won't get to play it unless you have a smart phone with Steam Gaurd enabled, or are willing to shell out ten dollars to Valve. Don't worry, you won't be missing out. The competitive mode hasn't changed one bit since beta, and suffers from the same problem regarding being matched with players of equal skill.  There is also a game breaking glitch that has yet to be fixed in which the match is stuck in warmup mode and thus is unable to end.  Needless to say, the last update was a complete failure, and considering that the game's updates have been releasing at even slower rates, and to little avail as far as helping fix the game, it is safe to say that Valve doesn't really care about the game, and is putting in as little effort as possible to keep the game afloat so they continue to sell keys and milk out what little money is left in this game.   So the above paragraphs mention all the things that went wrong with the new update, now I will discuss problems that have been plaguing the game for a long time now. For one, the game is almost a decade old, and the graphics are pretty ♥♥♥♥. Some consider this a plus, given that it allows you to run the game on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer, but since the game isn't optimized correctly after an update that came out about a year ago, you still get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ framerate no matter how powerful your computer is. The game also lacks basic customization features you would find in any modern game. The video features aren't that bad, but the audio features are terrible. The only customization options for audio is to change the master volume, and to change your mic gain and the voice volume of other players.  Another problem is the game's economy. It is pretty widely accepted that the tf2 economy is dead. This is a game that was known for it's in game economy, and the ability to trade items and make a profit. However, someone had the bright idea of creating a website for voting on the price of items, and it is now the universal standard for trading transactions in tf2. Anyone who has graduated highschool should be able to think of more than a few problems with the concept of voting on prices, but because the game has been plagued by a massive flood of little kids who wouldn't know any better, the website(backpack.tf) is here to stay. Needless to say, the market has almost completely stagnated, and trades are few and far between. The trading issue is even more exemplified by relatively recent changes made by Valve to steam trading as a whole, requiring mobile smartphone in app verification to be able to make trades. If you don't have a smart phone, you will be required to wait half of a month for your trade to actually go through. Fun.  I mention earlier that the game has been flooded by little kids. That is a problem in itself. Given that little kids are stupid and lack any fine motor skills, coordination, or brain power, you might as well be playing with someone who lost their hands. They aren't fun to play against, and they aren't fun to have on your team. The culprits causing their recent influx are most likely popular youtubers that play the game who tend to have young audiences. The kids see it, and because the game is free, they download and play it. This wouldn't even be that big of a deal if Valve was able to actually match people of equal skill together, that way skilled players wouldn't be stuck with little kids. But of course Valve doesn't match people together of equal skill, and because this is a team game requiring actual brainpower, skill, and teamwork, the consequences of being matched with little kids are substantial.   If you read all of that, hopefully you will see why the game just isn't fun to play. I would hope that in the future the game will be fixed up by Valve, but considering it has been years with very little progress, I wouldn't count on it.  P.S. A note about the formatting: For whatever reason, Steam doesn't like it when I tab, and just refuses to recognize those spaces. That's why the formatting looksl ike ♥♥♥♥."
I accualy like the competitive idea. But it still kinda ruined the game. BUT i wont downvote it because i have played it for 700 hours. Ahh 700 hours of killing people
"I'm volvo, I stubbornly refuse to listen to my players because in the height of my hubris I believe I am right and thousands of them are wrong. I will enforce a radical new direction of play and alienate a majority of a playerbase that had very little complaint with my product.  Dead game dead game dead game dead game dead game dead game dead game dead game dead game dead game dead game."
"It's a sad day for mankind when I can no longer recommend Team Fortress 2.  I love this game. It's chocked full of character, style, and depth. It contains some classic Valve wit, with their genuine polish that makes them one of my favorite developers. It's got so much in it, much of it free, that it's amazing.  But...things have changed. I believe my distaste started a while ago, a bitter feeling about an update that, while extremely full of good things, changed its Free 2 Play model somewhat. After Gun Mettle, the game developed a bunch of new content and locked it away behind a paywall. It restricted its own economy, but that I could live with; the game was still great, and everything was still fun.   Meet Your Match, the most recent update, changed all of that. It destroyed the Team Fortress 2 that I loved; it killed the fun of it, the joy, the silliness, the spirit. It changed it from its own unique, utterly bizarre, totally lovable and outrageous experience to a game that seems to be trying too damn hard to compete with Overwatch. I left TF2 for Overwatch, and found myself a polished, intense experience; but Overwatch fatigued me. It was intense, and constant. There was no downtime, no relaxing; it was fun but it was fun for a different reason. I ended up returning to Team Fortress 2, but I couldn't, because it was warped into a lesser version of the game that was actually a clone of TF2.   It's at the stage where the complete removal of the Meet Your Match Update would serve as a massive step forward for TF2, but that seems unlikely at this stage. The community is slowly withering away in its own private fury, the anger is palpable, but all is quiet from Valve. What felt like a silent, watchful guardian has become a neglectful, ignorant god that misunderstands that over which it has domain. I can't recommend this game anymore.  And that breaks my ♥♥♥♥ing heart."
Ahh TF2. So much fun till shenangins happened that made it extremely unbalanced and unfun.
First your reaction: OMG this game is free I dont need my wallet  and then spends Thousands of $ in hats and your reaction: do I even have money in my wallet  10/10 would bait again
"It's been a while since I have played, TF2 is a good game if you have money or are known, Since you'll only get accepted by the community if your having nice items as Australium's or Unusuals.  Why you might ask? Since they would call you a hacker and eventually ban/kick you from the server.  No wonder why people start playing cs:go or overwatch."
very fun to play especially the engineer
"The Only Good F2P FPS Shooter  I love this game but Needs more Optimization Hopefully the next update that makes TF2 Fully Optimized and Playable please valve, don't just add more cosmetics, it just makes SOME Potato or Mid PC user's fps go lower, lower, and lower until its Unplayable (RIP my Potato PC)  "
i like the game but my faovrite class is the scout he has super speed 
Do you like cosmetics and shooting at things well this game is for you
This game is da best evr in my ♥♥♥♥
"Could you please stand still, I'm trying to shoot you in the face.   -My Sniper"
Great game! Literally one of the best multiplayer experiences I've ever had. The controls are tight and the characters are amazing (if not a bit steretypical). A lot of weapon drops etc. to keep the game fresh and a lot of custom maps etc. if you look in the right places. I you're into FPS's with actual characters and community this is the game for you!
theres a couple of fun classes in this game. id suggest playing on your mac while at starbucks taking a break from your male hate threads on tumblr.
this is one of the best free to play games but there is one BIG PROBLEM VAVLE READ THIS: ON PLAYLOAD OR ANY OTHER DEFENSE MODE NOT TALKING ABOUT CUSTOM MAPS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THE SPAWN DELAY OF RED TEAM IS REALLY BIG AND IT CAUSED LOTS OF TIMES FOR THE RED TEAM TO LOSE WHILE THE BLUE TEAM SPAWNS 3 SECONDS AFTER DEATH VAVLE PLEASE FIX THIS AND I WILL BE PLEASED THANKS FOR READING HAVE A GOOD DAY.
most cancerous community and overall annoying game when matched with anyone who has skill.  10/10
"It has its kinks, but it remains the best and only war-themed hat simulator in existance. I believe it was indeed worth the wait."
it's ok
People are so upset about how TF2 was changed.  Nothing really changed because all you need to play the game is cosmetics. ;^)
hey wtf the new updat is gowing to make this game be a compatativ game that means thos taunts you aded it wont be eny use my 306 h i exsperentct a fun game spending over 5.000 dolers on the game and for what the game to get a teribel updat screw you valv i ame gowing to overwatch
"Team Fortress 2 . . where do I start? Absolutely loved this game, but times have changed. It started with the Love and War Update.   Valve started prepping the game for 'competitive mode' by listening to feedback from major competitive players. For those who don't know, the main format for 'comp' is 6s, or 6 players on each team. Team Fortress 2 weapons and classes obviously were not designed for nor balanced for 6v6, they were balanced for 12v12. The current 'meta' for 6s is 2 Soldiers, 2 Scouts, 1 Demo and 1 Medic. When Valve started balancing weapons for this new mode, do you think they buffed weaker classes to make them more viable in 6s, or do you think Valve listened to vocal Soldier mains?  Sadly it is the latter. During the Love and War Update and coinidentally after prominent TF2 competitive player 'b4nny' posted a youtube video explaining why the degreaser was overpowered and a 'straight up upgrade'. He suggested that the Degreaser had the SAME PLAYSTYLE as stock. Is he a pyro main? No. He was right in saying that the Degreaser should not have TWO functions: fast switcher AND air-blaster. Valve could have handled this by only increasing airblast cost, forcing players to choose their airblasts wisely, and then create an entirely new, slow-switching airblast flamethrower, but no, it got nerfed to oblivion. The changes made to the Degreaser and the Reserve Shooter ultimately lowered the skill ceiling of the pyro and encouraged the W + M1 behavior we hear complaints about.   Next, they decided that the Heavy was too powerful. Obviously, having a heavy on your team when there are only six opposing players is going to be a huge advantage. The main complaint from competitive players was Heavies ability to use positioning and the element of surprise to jump around a corner and mow tiny baby men down. Sorry competitive players, but this was actually one of the few 'skillful' playstyles/strategies that Heavy had (Flanking and abushing). How did Valve handle this? Did they make minor changes to Heavy's mobility? Slight adjustments in damage output? Prevent revving while jumping? No. They added damage and accuracy ramp up. This changed the Heavy vs Heavy meta from who fired first into who has been firing longer. This encouraged dull, mindless gameplay of continuous firing so you don't lose your accuracy. This also magnifies Heavy's mobility weakness, not to mention giving away your location. Once again, they made a change that lowered the skill ceiling of a class.  There are other ridiculous class changes that Valve has made, but those were just a few of the worst.  Lastly, focusing on competitive has ruined the idea of Team Fortress 2 as a goofy, casual shooter where you can join a game for a few minutes and have fun.  How they ruined the basic premise of the game is beyond me, but here's how they did it.  They removed quickplay! Seriously!? They added a new mode ironically named 'Casual Mode'. Each game is a competitive style match that pits teams of 12 against each other. Not only does this mode take longer to join than quickplay, this mode is not casual at all. Players gain rank and are matched against similar ranks. What happened to being able to play with all skill levels? Why have a score? This causes players to care more about the game and their score than their team. It discourages quickly playing the game for a few minutes for fun. I don't want to play CS:GO. Creating a competitive mindset changes your teammates in vengeful, uncaring try-hards.   And in the new competitive mode, they had the nerve to show your 'K/D ratio'. This is ♥♥♥♥♥ TEAM Fortress 2. Playing medic? Shame on you and your lousy K/D.   TL:DR Valve, stop balancing the game for 6s, the majority of players don't care for compeitive, and it's ruining TF2's casual fun."
COME ON VALVE FIX THIS STUPID UPDATE
"Stupid, this new update ruined everthing. Takes forever to find a stupid match, and lags way to much. maybe if you fixed it where we can actually find a match, then it would be better."
"Wow Valve...I thought things were bad when you made the game free to play and the servers filled with bunches of noisy, spamming peeps, waiting to be carried by those who had bought and played the game. But you know what? I gritted my teeth and dealt with it -- popped around servers until I could find a decently balanced one. This last big update? NOPE. It's not gonna fly with me. You just changed something fundamental about the game, that made it the fun game it was. So now, it's fundamentally flawed, and I will have nothing to do with it."
TF2 is a fun multiplayer shooter with amazing loot and hats its more fun with friends but tends to lag a bit sometimes over all a fantastic game
Game was osm but the new update sucks. I must wait 5 minutes to join game. Update realy sucks. Please Valve can you give us our old game ? ;( Everyone hate this update. For now game sucks.
i hate how valve tries to RUIN the game again and again and again....  seriously what the hell is wrong with valve?
"Probably my favorite Hat simulator, and honestly just anything thats better than CoD is a game I like"
great game
"TF2 is love,TF2 is life"
"What can you find in TF2 you might ask? Let me tell you!  -My Little Pony RPs -Achivements Idle Servers -Servers where you can level up your stranges in minutes -Trade Servers -Parkour Fortress -Jailbreak Servers -Garry Mod maps in TF2 where you can play GMod in TF2 -x10 servers -Randomizier Servers -x10 Randomizier Servers -Freak Fortress Servers -Surf Servers -AND MORE SERVERS  You can also find:  -F2P Snipers that stand still for the entire game -P2Ps bragging to the F2Ps about their hats -Hackers -Spy Crabs -The Demo's weird arm -Scammers -CoD kids -Minecraft kids -FNaF kids -CoD, Minecraft, and FNaF kids -Pocket Medics -Market Gardening Soldiers -The Demopan -People who spend all their money on unusuals -Racist kids -Racist Adults -Mic Spammers -The Undertale Fandom -AND MORE  I give it ita 420/360, would trickstab again."
pls stay alive...
they ruinded this game with the updates now match making harder and more of a pain then ever
This Game Is AMAZING! Its A Good Game To Find And Make New Friends! ^^ Also There Are Many Servers That Are Made By The Community.
"DO NOT LET YOUR CHILDREN PLAY THIS GAME!  I love this game, so its sad that it has come to this. I simply can not recommend it. The game play and fun makes for a great game.  What makes it a fail is the community. First it is filled with unwatched children. However that is not the problem, that is the environment. The problem happens when racism and hatred is blantent and rampent. Infact its so common to hear racism that I usually see it every game, but a few games in my 100 hours have been clean... a few...  I have seen racism and hate in many other games, but never too this extreme. The game does nothing too prevent it, block it, or prohibit it. I suspect and have seen evidence that there are adults attempting to persuade vulnerable youth into their hate. Unfortunately it seems to be working, because its common to hear and see hate filled language coming from a voice of a child.  I was 'warned' as well because I got trolled for posting a story about Team Fortress 2, In the 'General Discussion' for 'Off Topic' Discussion. I was refered to the community guidlelines that support my decision to post this topic. Sadly its another power hungry forum moderator who does a terrible job at keeping the environment friendly and free of harrassment. Unfortunately this poor type of moderation just encurages the bullys and trolls. Its clear that Valves anti-racism is a half ♥♥♥ job with a terrible record that only enforces bad people to control the community resources. Pittiful.  Very sad and unfortunately valve just wants it hidden. I suspect it will never get better. Go buy Overwatch or any other game."
"After 3300 hours, I have decided that this is a great game.  You should buy it. ;)"
its the biets game ever
"TF2 was a good game about a year ago. Since then it has been plagued with un-cooperative and un-responsive developers, poor updates that make the game less fun and more frustrating to play, and poor optimizations that have rapidly lowered the performance. TF2 is a game that isn't cared about anymore, so why should you?  I apologize if this seems a little bit whiney, but it does, in my opinion, describe the current state of TF2. You will be missed."
I love This Game 
Key + Crate = Hat Hat + F2P = Beg for Hat Beg + Annoyed Players = Mute Begger  11/10 Would mute again....
"This game,It's basically my life,I can't even imagine a world without this ('Cause it's one of the only games I play) It has everything Beer? CHECK Hats? CHECK! Stuff that do nothing but everybody wants them anyways? CHECK X2! I definetely recommend this aslong as you have cash,because you don't wanna get called a F2P/Noob 24/7,right?"
i spent way to much money on this... but i love it...
"Truly one of the best and funniest first person shooters I've ever played! There's so many things that you can do playing Team Fortress 2, whether you're having a peace party with Red and Blu team, defending Mann Co. from robots, you'll never get bored! Best part of all is that it's 100% free to play, but I know you'll be premium in about a few weeks... So what are you waiting for? Download this masterpiece of a game now!"
It's ok
want to boost your ego further beyond relief? have the appropiate amount of money to waste? this is the game for you.
Better Than CoD
U still haven't tried this one? WHY!? Just download &amp; get fun from playing! GO!
I Really Like this game. 
I WUV THIS GAME 9/10 ITS JUST SOO ADDICTING! I WUV YOO VALVE FOR THIS AMAZING CREATION! :'D MAKES ME WANT TO CRY :D
Team Fortress 2 is best game play for 1 one million player played
"If you dont own this why do you even have a computer?!  Also, get autobalanced onto the losing team simulator 2007."
"Very addictive and fun, I just wish they still had quickplay"
wow Good Game Awesome xD
Best free to play game ever!
"Team Fortress 2 is a team-based FPS. This classic FPS features 9 destinct classes with unique personalities, weapons (items), cosmetics and playstyles. The game can be played casual or competitive (highlander, new mm). The gamemodes vary aswell as the community, you can join a pug in which you will find a friendly heavy, a demoknight and a f2p or you can join a competitive and face off against pros. The game itself is very simple, but extraordinary and genuine at the same time. I myself have played over 1000h and experienced a ton of events &amp; even unboxed an unusual, I regret none of them this game was great every second and its free.  I rate this game a 8/10"
"TF2 used to be fun, but now its just Valve's little pitty party; they could easily fix it, but dont expect valve to actually DO something useful and smart; Valve has now long been known for being better at selling other people's games, than making, or even working on their own games."
10/10 would play Overwat...uhhh.... i mean TF2 again
"Well, Valve managed to pretty much ruin this game. Before the update you could get into a game in less than 5 mins, now it takes almost a half an hour. And you get temporairly banned just for leaving the game. It you don't like competitive mode, then you're done for. You have to buy tickets that are a dollar just to play mann vs machine. They ruined casual and almost are forcing us to play competitive. Either you pay $10 to play competitive or play on a crappy community server. Valve if you are reading this, please fix this game."
Newest update was ♥♥♥♥. The Casual is now competetive which is really stupid. It was way better before and right now its trying to hard to be Overwatch. Ya i said Vavle
"Can't play a competitive match without it being ruined by a hacker with a team that takes pride and brag for being in a team with a hacker. Even in a casual game, a freakin' casual game."
"I really, really don't want to give this game a bad review as it was one of my favourite games, but I guess I have to, since the latest update killed it. First of all, autobalance got removed so you can't play a single balanced match. Second thing, Matchmaking, it takes so long to find a match, litterally spend 10 minutes of matchmaking to play a 2 minutes match. Then I wanna talk about Casual and Competitive... causal is the unbalanced one with one team that always wins and one that always loose, then there's competitive, wich is the same unbalanced ♥♥♥♥ but if you leave the match the game will penalize you. So, this is it, a really fun game killed by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ update R.I.P. Team Fortress 2 2007/2016"
"Recent update sucks. I used to get put into a game right away, now I seem to be just waiting and waiting. In my personal opinion, we didn't need this update. Great if everyone else loves it, but it's definitely not my cup of tea. Bye, TF2!"
Sucks. Valve don't even let me delete this ♥♥♥♥ from my library. Worked with other free-to-play games.
it's okay    its the best  
Great game. 1000 hours and still not bored. 1337/69 ruined my life.

"Ruined my social life, stole my wallet, and made me go insane. 10/10, always fun to play, and always better than Overwatch."
"It has been 2 years and now I have more than 1000 hours... Will never leaving my Steam Libraries, ever."
"This was once a joke review. But after all the hours I spend in this game after I wrote this I decided to change it. There are enough joke reviews for this game anyhow.  Seriously though. This game might not be the newest and it definitely has it's problems, but it's a ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful pearl of a game.  I've met so many amazing people and friends over this game, found a great community, spend thousands of hours having fun and even got to prove myself over competitive with a great team for a while.  A very friendly to learn shooter that promises a lot of fun and a lot of hours. It just feels satisfying. No matter what class you'd like to play, there is something you'll be good at.  Though I gotta say, the new updates of the game honestly kind of destroyed it a little bit. I will always come back to it, but I miss the old days where pubs could last for hours. &lt;/3"
ye pretty good i give it two thumb bones up
"Team Fortress 2 is a fun, addictive multiplayer mayhem. It's cartoonish graphics, insane weapons and hats provide hours of gameplay, while also letting the player build their own unique roster of fighting tools and cosmetics. Definitely worth a try if you like FPS style games, relatively easy gameplay or a richly created world. 10/10"
"This game is in my opinion the most addictive shooter. You have 9 completly different classes to play : Scout, Medic, Pyro, Soldier, Engineer, Heavy, Demoman, Spy, Sniper. Every Class has its own playstyles, which can also be changed by a large amount of different weapons for every slot : primary, secondary, melee. You Don't die so easy in this game, so you can play really hard, long duels against players. But never think you are indestructible. Something could kill you instantly. If you want to learn the game, you need to play it. You need to learn the classes pros and cons.  After ca. 100 hrs of playing this game you will be able to learn the game.  Give it a try, you'll not repend it."
It is Freaking AWESOME :D
Still more players than Infinite Warfare
Fun game addicting
'Free' to play.
how do i throw grenades
hatshatss
"now that i have 3000+ hours on this game. i think i can tell you that it is worth trying team fortress 2, once you are into it you wont be able to stop  update: this game will keep dragging you back in, its alot of fun"
"Over 2,700 hours in and still a fun game, Meet Your Match hasn't ruined it for me."
"Ah, Team Fortress 2. This was my favorite game and it was probably one of the only games I played while I had free time. The gameplay was fun and the servers were awesome, not to mention the random types of players you would find (friendlies, spycrabs, people with 997 ping). It was a great game until valve removed pubs from the find game menu. Pubs were the main reason that I played tf2. It allowed for 'easy' gaming, but still let you have fun.   I was interested in competitive mode when it first came out, but never got around to playing it. Now that pubs have been replaced with casual mode, I no longer find any fun in majority of the game. I entered one 'casual' hightower round and was devasted to find it was practically a server of tryhards. Hightower is a map I go just to relax and hang around. Now I found myself actually having to try to play, and the leaving consequences made me cringe.  Don't get me wrong, I still love the game for the community servers you can go on and still play it, but the removal of pubs really darkened my outlook of tf2. Overall, my total view on tf2 is pretty good, and is why I recommend it. I'm just thankful that I began playing before this update."
it's alright
"If you haven't yet purchased TF2, then I do not suggest starting now.   TF2 has had a tremendous arc of transformation. Starting as a well-balanced class-based shooter, then two years of growth: new maps, new game modes, new weapons. Players who got in early enjoyed a ride from a simple beginning to a challenging game of depth and complexity, and fun..  In it's third life, TF2 is now a microtransaction MMO combat shooter. People playing in 2011 seem more interested in item acquisition than the balanced team combat game this used to be. My Steam Friends buy crappy games to get the hats that they unlock in TF2. Really? Hats?  If you're reading this, then odds are good that you've played many hours of TF2 with me. You know I'm not the best TF2 player out there. Far from it. Maybe that's why I don't enjoy this game any longer... there doesn't seem to be any room for a casual TF2 experience anymore. Either you play 20 hours/week, or you don't play at all.  You can't turn back the clock."
I just smoked a lot of crack!
This game is my life. It has changed me. I have become a pub star and noobs rage quit before i even join. Team Fortress is love Team Fortress is Life. With the help of my highly pretigious group The Shire Brothers we have successully conquered all the pubs and conjoined those lands with those of The Shire. They have tought me that to be the best you have to beat a bunch of noobs so that is what I all day everyday. My eyes have been opened to the truth. This game is the future of our society. I forsee that parents will no longer be excited when their child take their first step rather commend their children on their first killstreak in game or their first strange weapon. I recommend this game to everyone with a open heart so maybe you will see the truth as I have.
One of my favorite games!
"Really exciting game! Nine classes which all play very diffrently, lots of diffrent maps &amp; gamemodes and a hell lot of costumization options which will either change your favorite class' look (hundreds of hats) or playstyle (tons of weapons). "
"It doesnt matter how good your are anymore, you will be judged solely on the hats you own"
Wow what great game!
This game is amazing. Took 328910472361829746217 hours out of my life. It's really a must play with lots of awesome cosmetics as well! (Sorry Finn XD) It's really the heart of steam.
game very good yes
Best Hat Simulator in History would give life to again 10/10
"Looks simple, high skill ceiling, and hats. 10/10 my most played game on steam so far."
"so far it's hilarious, The matchmaking time! jesus! Still it's ok to play"
"TeamFortress 2 is a game that allows you to play as 9 classes which all of unique abilites, and over 14 gamemodes to have fun playing. The game is rather quite addicting and allows you to have a laugh from time to time when playing. Team Fortress 2 is a free game unless you would like to purchase accessories for your classes. Overal I would give Team Fortress 2 a 9.7/10."
Best FPS Multiplayer game ever :D just love playing it &lt;3 (y)
Played 1000 hours of this ♥♥♥♥ .... nuff said .Get it !Enoy It ! Thank me later.
. lol . it . be . good . game .
"This game is good, dont listen this negative rewiews, they are only raging coz they lost Quickplay and they cant get over it.  Good things  + ez to play but difficult to master, u must invest thousands of hours into it. + lots of weps (hope there will be more of them), every single wep can change your playstyle + 9 amazing classes ofc, each 1 with another story, playstyle and more... + gamemodes like payload (push cart from A to B), koth, ctf, control points, attack/defence, payload race...or some special... + hats + medic mains + nice cartoon and easy graphic, nothing exaggerative + lots of things which i forget + hundreds of achievments  Bad things  - weapon skins (but iam using them, iam hypocrite) - medic mains  - pyro mains - pyro mains - uncompleted casual mode ...thats only what i dont like on this game  wow you read it wow, go now and play it"
"This is one of the best games I've played, I highly recommend playing this game. :)"
"I love this game, but I swear I got money in my wallet, before I downloaded it..."
its ok
Yes I would It's Really Enjoyable to play while doing Nothing because Most people are bored And they might have something to talk about When You play this Game so I recommend This Game!
"Competitive update has completely ruined the game. 'Casual' mode is competitive without a ranking. I haven't been able to get into a single game because of how ♥♥♥♥ing broken the servers are. I have literally waited for over an hour just to get into a casual match. A ♥♥♥♥ing casual match. Not only that, but from what I have heard, there are ♥♥♥♥ing penalties for leaving a ♥♥♥♥ing casual match. What the ♥♥♥♥ Valve. Quickplay is no longer a thing, it's pretty much 'if you don't want to play competitive, ♥♥♥♥ off.' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥."
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  420/-69
"Highly addicting! and if the pubbing isn't enough then there's always the MGE, jumping and much more!"
This game is getting old but i still like it very much becouse of the fun that you could have playing it
"This game made me violently dedicated to Bostonians, and I'm not even from Boston.  Inter-City Bonding SImulator 2015."
MORE LIKE CONGA FORTRESS 2 AMIRITE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Its TF2 and its free and plays like dream. Probably in my opinion one of the best multiplayer game. The community is very much alive and the amount of quality time you can have is unbelievable.   A+
Team Fortress 2 is the best FPS on steam. The quality of everything from the balanced combat to the soundtrack is top-notch. This game takes a different approach to the FPS genre especially in art style and community involvement. It also has a sense of collectibility (  hats  ) that add to the addictive qualities of the game. I highly recommend this game to anyone (  It's free  ) so what are you waiting for reading this? Download it now!
"TF2 was a really fun game but after the Meat your Match update broke the game uterly and the game breaking bugs that havent been patched yet since the launch of the update. Neglection like this proves that Valve really has no love for this game or they really dont know what the hell they are doing. Only 5 Devs are working on this game and none of them play this game. I say this because most of the changes that happen to this game only come from statistics from in-game senarios (think about all of the trolls running around with sandwiches and spy crabs for one second) and what modern games (COD, BF, CS:GO) implement in their games but when the TF2 devs coded it in. They didnt even properly test the system before forcing it onto the players. Like I said at the begining, the game became 100% broken. 'Meet your Match'? more like 'Wait your Match' with the que system taking up to 5 hours for a 5 minute match of Swiftwater. Competitive mode. Dont even get me started on dat ♥♥♥♥ m8. I was in the Beta for its release since April and it was broken the whole way through. It was as unpolished AF at launch. The Ranking system was broken, XP was broken, and abandons were almost unpunishing. Games were unplayible throughout the WHOLE BETA and when it launched IT WAS STILL BROKEN!, WITH ALL OF THE SAME PROBLEMS IT HAD IN BETA!. Comp was been in beta since late 2014 to late 2016 and it looked like it was created in ONE DAY by someone who has never even opened SDK or a C++ program before. For Community Servers. We have to scavenge through all of the garbage Idle Servers, Orange Servers, Surfs, and 24/7 Turbine Servers, ECT. And they all have broken plugins like All-Critz, Donater Perks, Ads, ECT. There are like 10 servers MAX that are actually good. Before 'Meet Your Match' I would have given this game a 8.5/10, now I give it a 3.5/10.  Sincerly Pubert"
it was good until they changed the game interface
"Best game on steam, 10/10, i like how it lets you play before you actally spend money on it"
i love the game but the updates ruin the game and it takes away the fun i don't like the updates can you please fix this
"this is a game that consumes my life. I like it ALOT. i lost all my friends because of this game and if i could go back in time and choose my friends or this game, i would choose Team Frotress 2 EVERY TIME. plus who needs friends."
Its amazing. The compettive aspect. everything.
9/11 CAN'T ♥♥♥♥♥ QUICKSKOPE AS SNOPPER   Edit: 10/11 you can noscope headshot noobs :)
"This is an awesome, fun,vintage game. Trust me, it offers WAYYY more than COD or BF. Plus its F2P!!!!"
"Very, Very very addicting, but still a great game.   Also did i mention, Hats?  hats anyone?"
Good Game . Love it
i guess i played it a little bit idk about the gameplay though
TRUST ME I HAVE 300 HOURS !!!! 
It is a good game.
"The Best Fps i have on PC its constantly getting better, like every month there is something new with this fantasic game. thank Obama, And VALVE"
"HI GUYS YOU PROBABLY WONT READ THIS BUT I REALLY REALLY WANT TO BE COME A FAMUS UTUBR. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE ADVERTISING THEIR CHANNELS, BUT IM DIFFERENT. PLS DONT HATE IM JUST TRYING TO SUPPORT MY 3 CHILDREN IN MEXIO, LAST YEAR THEY WERE DIAGNOSED WITH ♥♥♥♥♥♥ LACK OF MONEY SYNDROME, I CRI EVY TIME."
"Best. Game. Ever, 3 reasons why; 1. Sandvich 2. Pootis 3. HATS!"
i can eat a sandvich !!! 10/10
"I would like to say that Team Fortress 2 is awesome. After playing Team Fortress classic and seeing the big difference I noticed how amazing the gameplay is. Just like any other standard first person shooter the world of TF2 is challenging and full of wacky stages both by Valve and the community. The wide variety of items is amazing and the characters are all special and unique. I'll be honest in the beginning I just knew TF2 would be like any other first person shooter, I have come to realize that it is fare from it. What it develops in character it also develops a well balanced and in-depth story line that leaves the player begging for more. The gameplay is smooth and the graphics are above average. There is room for improvement but as far as i'm concerned right now the world of TF2 is amazing so far."
GREATE GAME PLAY IT
Its a nice game ^^!
"this is the most iconic game of valve ever sooo yea its great theres comedy, killing and violence, and pointless hats that will somehow make players think your worse or better than themDX still the best game ever doe"
"Team Fortress: The Sequel to Garry's Mod is a game dedicated to transforming the point-and-click adventure game scene forever. Revel in the true (cel-shaded) warlike experience all the while sporting an expensive, fancy fedora that resembles the one you own in real life! Face irrational people as they yell and assume to their hearts' content as you stand by bewildered that such people even exist! Your options within the game dictate how the story plays out, giving YOU the ability to wear a hat and create a dynamic story for you and your wacky friends.  Select from a wide range of options in dialog such as:  'I don't like you person 1' 'I don't like you person 2' 'jesus christ shut the ♥♥♥♥ up seriously who the ♥♥♥♥ argues this much over nothing?' '♥♥♥♥♥♥'  Also I think there are some zombies in this game."
"Amazing game . Awesome detail . Really clean , amazing gameplay experience . Can easily addict people . TF2 Rocks"
People like to trade hats more than they like to play. Best game of all time.
"Amazing game, totally reccomend. I have 1000 hours and know people with many more. Now give me Steam levels &gt;:)"
this game is fantastic if you're british or have a really chronic hat obsession that could lead to severe mental diseases and killing your entire family or neighborhood  or if you're a gay or bi furry or brony just go find a server and say you like ♥♥♥♥♥ or something with a ;) at the end of the sentence you think i'm joking i'm not  also f2p ruined everything for people who play regularly   i give this game a lobotomy out of headwear  go play dota 2 instead or something
"This is a good game over-all. What makes it unsuitable to some audience? Well... the people who play it.  Let's be honest, a big part of a game's downfall is the community. You want a diverse and fun community that compells you to come back and play the game. But often I find myself going on servers and seeing people completely toxic and talking ♥♥♥♥ to others, and generally being unsportsmanlike.  The game is balanced, it is not pay to win as the things you would pay for are just cosmetic and appearance. It has no stat distributions on the items you purchase, and if there are (for example the weapons,) they're balanced and are generally worse or better than the weapons you start with; mostly depending on how you or others see it.  It's fun and it has a lot of replayability. You can jump on a server and experience so many different things.  So yes, I recommend it."
The best game ever besides the key prices.......
I've played it for a little bit. Love it so far.
"its free, its fun, its challenging, and it has fun graphics. and its free so get it now "
Contains a better economy than most third world countries.
TF2 - The only game where 12 year old kids think they are economists and know everything about money.
"The new matchmaking sucks, go play overwatch until the bring back quickplay #savetf2"
"It's ok, i have only played a few hours but I recommend."
its gd buy it
This game most importantly has hats and let it be known with utmost certainty that any gentleman is not one without one!
awsume game :D
#1 reason to play this game: HATS
this game gives me dem feels
Hats! Need I say more?
This game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.
This game is probably one of the most realistic shooter simulators I have ever played. It's probably the best top notch modern warfare simulator in the black market. I recomennd the game to those who have a chewing gum and one buck in their pocket to buy a fictional fedora because girls dig fedoras.
I AM A POOTIS CHARGE!!!
The best game!
"Best free to play game, very action packed, very customizable which makes it user friendly + variety of graphic options based on how much your computer can handle"
Yes a game who everyone can enjoy
Best and only hat simulator. Now with weapons.
Hey your games is cool. it has stuff i like too so bye!
This game will blow your mind with all the things you can find and all the servers you can play. Play that wonderfull game !!!
"Its a great free to play game ,but its also 20 GB got to give up space for the hats!"
"This game is top notch, some hate it, some like it. Depends on what you like. This game consist of a whole bunch of diffrents modes and my favorite is attk/def. And as of characters there are: Scout, Soilder, Spy, Demoman, Engineer, Pyro, Sniper, Heavy, and of corse, the medic. Personally, I like the egineer, medic, and the scout. Now I'm not gonna go into detail, but just know you'll have a fun times, or bad times whenever you're ♥♥♥♥ing dominated. But if you keep at it, you'll become good. Just takes some time. Okie anyways this game is awesome, and I tottaly recomend it if you're looking for an awesome F2P game."
"Extremely fun, tons of ways to play, and even more ways to customize. Team Fortress 2 is a must-have for those who love FPS games, cartoonish artwork, amazing replayability, or even all of the above.  Right, and there's hats. A LOT of them.  *Those who hate FPS games but love cartoon artwork should try this game anyways because it's still really fun and doesn't revolve around guns/killing. It revolves around hats.*"
"This is a HIGHLY (caution) addicting war game thats based off of The classic Team fortress. Pick any out of the 9 classes and play as them, as you play you will find items and those items you find will go straight to your inventory so you can equip it using M. There are fun updates such as Scream Fortress 2 (Halloween) Smissmass 2 (Christmas). You can even Trade in the game too! Trade your unloved items to someone for an item you want!"
"maybe you played at launch, maybe not. maybe you were a former player who felt alienated because of all the hats and other nonsense and gave it up. whatever the reason was i recommend returning to this great game. sure it got ridiculous with all the hats and other nonsense but it's still hella fun. i know i was one of those people who moaned and groaned when this game became F2P. but i gave in downloaded and am having a blast. so in short, wanna shoot ♥♥♥♥ up and have some fun? i highly recommend this."
Hat Simulator with a shooting minigame.
"I don't know exactly what you guys were thinking, but gotta rake in that money right? This new update just takes what made this game fun and is probably going to turn it into a hive of MLG try hard masters in no time. If that's what you wanted then good job. This is no longer a hat simulator, this is now CS:GO 2. "
It is very fun.
"Bestest F2P game there is. It has everything: Serious play, Silly play, hats, unlockable ♥♥♥♥, a great community, an internal economy and your mother loves it. Did I mention it is free? Go play it nao"
"Team Fortress 2 is an amazing, incredibly original take on the first person shooter genre, providing 9 insanely balanced classes, as well as unlockable weapons that are balanced as much as humanely possible. Complete with awesome maps and an amazing community, Team Fortress 2 is easily my most favorite game of all time and is an incredible experience. For those who have not yet given it a shot for whatever reason, it has arguably the best free-to-play model one could ask for in a game, where only optional aspects of the game become accessible once you go premium (specifically trading). 100%, at least give it a shot."
Best Online FPS Game !!! Great characters with different abilities to choose from. Really liked it :) Recommended.
"Used to be obssesed with this game, but I moved on to other games. This is one of the best free to play games out there with plenty of optional micro transactions."
"Yeah, Its pretty good."
after 400 hours playing the game valve ♥♥♥♥ed up on meet your match update  #BRINGBACKOLDTF2
"stopped playing in mid 2015 since the game got so stale  tried new update, the games better but i think slapping my ♥♥♥♥ on the screen would be more effective than vac at keeping out hackers. ♥♥♥♥ even cod mw2 players could laugh at how many hackers there are now, and this casual mode jst enables them. give you a passing grade for managing to still suck some of my hard earned cash and bieng less stale now (overwatch id recommend for a more polished experience, but for skill based mechanics tf2 still is supreme)"
"Team Fortress 2 was one of those games that I could just pick up and play and not have to worry about it. Now, after the Meat your Match update, it is not. Sure there are some good things about the update like cleaning up the menu, a new ui that is okay, and others (few at that). I'm not going to go into detail on the things that are just so mind-bogglingly frustrating, but I will say this: Valve has said that they are going to make updates to another update that they said 'had a rough launch.' The hours that I have in the last 2 weeks are just from this past weekend finding out what they did to the game. I will not refuse to play it, I will just not enjoy it."
New matchmaking mode is totally ruining the game!
wow look a new update wait it is ♥♥♥♥ now
"There is a set of cosmetics for literally everyone. Aside from being able to wear 3 cosmetic items and 1 action item(Can either be a noise maker, canteen[purely cosmetic outside of Mann vs Machine], spellbook[purely cosmetic outside of Halloween], or taunts such as laughing at enemies or Hi-5ing a teammate) some items are paintable for which you can make it a variety of colors from white to brown to lime green or even simply team colored. Some items also have different styles that can make them look a little different.  My biggest gripe are the players who are terrible at the game. Those who never listen to adivce or reccomendation, who use weapons such as the Rocket Jumper or Sticky Jumper for combat, and who just simply idiots."
"This is probably one of valves greatest creations. This game is very fun and interesting to play, from defending points to fighting a giant flying eyeball. This game is a fps team-based multiplayer shooter, but there are exceptions to that. There are 9 classes you can play as, each customizable in the sense of how they look and what weapons they use. See this is where Valve gets you, the Mann Co. Store, from there you can buy hats, weapons, and keys for unlocking crates you get. Now the crates are pretty hard to get something useful from them, as in its random and you have a small chance to get something valueble from them, for example an unsual hat, or some special weapon. Now there is also another way to ge unique items, Mann vs Machine. In this game mode you battle agaisnt waves of robots and tanks, but you dont do it alone, you have with you up to 6 players being the default defending with you side by side. Lets not forget special events, Team Fortress 2 has annual events, for example Scream Fortress(Halloween), Smismass(Chirstmas), and Saxxy Awards. Now Scream Fortress and Smismass get all festive and add weapons and outfits for you characters, but The Saxxy Awards is an event were people would use Source Film Maker to make movies. Winners would get a saxxy for all of their characters and a golden wrench for the engineer in-game. What are you still doing reading my review, get out there and play this game. For more information go to  http://www.teamfortress.com/ "
"Last update removed all the fun I had with this game... I used to play this game a lot and it was one of my favorite fps of all time, it is far not the case anymore. The matchmaking was perfect for me, what have you done dev team ????"

i do like tf2 but now i cant go in the game when i press play it does not go to the game
"Fun game, at times. If you love hats and wasting your money you will love this game. A little to fremium to my liking. For instance I stopped playing around 6-7 months ago and didn't boot it again till about a week ago, looked at the store, found NO new weapons but an ASSLOAD of hats. Didn't realise Valve would reduce this game to a money making front. Overall get the game if you like hats, dont get it if you like the objective"
"Awesome fun game. If you are not going to try this game, you are probably a fool."
"eat sleep tf2, eat sleep tf2, eat sleep tf2, eat sleep tf2,  its a viscious cycle....          PLEASE SEND HELP"
this is a great game and i would recommend everyone to play it!
Love this game. Very addicting. Can't stop.
Got 11 head shots in a row with the bazar bargain in Team Fortress 2! Great game and highly recommended and as a bonus it is free! Don't forget to subscribe to my YouTube channel!
die of ♥♥♥♥ing cancer valve u ♥♥♥♥ing noob developers
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
Addicting I love trading its a good game:)
"Well, this game is so fun and very different from other 'FPS-ish- game, the only downside for this game is about hat fortress or conga fortress that make the gameplay change dratically, but personally i like hat and stuff but it kinda annoying sometime haha, 8,5/10"
This is by far the best game I have ever seen.
I haven't played too much so I can't really give you a good opinion on this game
"TF2 in 4 words: WAR THEMED HAT SIMULATOR This game was supposed to be a cute looking fps, but became trading centre ;) Class are balanced Gameplay is nice and funny   XERDEZ APPROVED"
Did not like tf2 because they delete map search and i can't join a asian server theres 120 or 100 but it keeps joining me on not asian server and im so laggy every time i play tf2 i have no lagand i hope they will bring back the old deays
I really loved TF2 and played it over 1000 hours. But the last major update ruined the Gameplay. Pls Valve change it back!!! Reasons:  1: Why does every Game need grades? 2: A quick match on a 'normal' server is much better. But now only joining a game using standard search doesnt finish in a dog ages :(
Was the best game on steam.... New update sucks need to change it back.
Pretty damn good new update kinda ruined servers though
"Meet Your Match  Valve you ♥♥♥♥ed up.  Sure you put out some bad updates but this one is a game breaker.  No more quick play, I have to play in a causal lobby and wait 20 minutes for a game to start, or wade through community servers to find a good game. 10 USD for comp, including players with beta passes. The update wasen't all bad I like the keyless crates bring back old cosmedics, and thats it. There is still time to change."
If u play u loose ur life and ur face becomes a computer and u miss school and ur family will forget about you and you will starve to death. apart from that it is good game
"Spent all my money on hats, I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN DAYS. 10/10"
"I like this game and all but, this game is about fun, not competitive. Valve please stop trying to compete with Overwatch."
"We all know this game. Some of us love it, some of us hate it. But what really makes this game so good? Well, first of all, it's more of an alternative title when compared to the modern military shooters like Call of Duty and Battlefield. It also has a lot of different communities, you could say. One last reason it's good is because it's free. So let's start at the first part, it's an alternative title. Sure, it's made by one of the largest video game companies in the world (even though they barely make games), but it's not, like I said before, your over the top, Michael Bay explosions, modern military FPS. It's just a game about a battle between two teams of identical mercenaries in the early '70s. Another good thing about it being an alternative title is that they don't have to compete with the other FPS franchises. This means that they don't have to crank out a sequel every year and add on excessive DLC to get even more money. Now let's talk about the different communities. The three main communities are the pub community, trading community, and competitive community. The pub community is the players who just play to have a good time, they don't take the game very seriously. The trading community is the group of people who trade in-game items for a profit. And, finally, the competitive community is, of course, the people who play this game competitively. Now let's talk about it being free. It's free. if you don't like it, you can just uninstall it and you don't have to worry about getting your money back. Now, you're probably thinking 'lel y u be so optimistic' right now. That's about to change. I know that nothing is perfect, so I'm going to tell you about some of the notable imperfections this game has. First of all, remember how I said that this game doesn't have DLC? Well Valve found another way to get money (this is the same thing they do for DotA 2 and CS:GO), in-game purchases. 'what do they sell?' you're asking. To which I respond: Cosmetics (and weapons, but mostly cosmetics). By cosmetics, I mean hats. Another bad part about this game is the community. I've been part of this community for much more than a year and I can say that, just because the game's good, doesn't mean the community's good, because it's not. The community is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, cloppers, porn-sprayers, little kids, people who go on pub and competitive servers to trade, people who think they're better because they have hats, Lenny face spammers, people who offend other people for ethnicity, race, religion, etc. (you won't find many of those last guys). One last bad thing about this game, it gets boring. There aren't that many game modes and with the small size of the maps, you just start to get bored. In fact, I don't even know why so many people, including myself, have so many hours on this game because I get so bored after about three rounds of attack/defense. In short, I would recommend this game. It might to be a good idea to weigh out the pros and cons before you get it, but it doesn't really matter because it's free, so you might want to take a stab at it either way."
killed my family lost my job no more money thanks valve 10/10
It's fun to just duck around with friends and shoot peeps.  Also hats.
"oh god, I love this game SO MUCH, but beware of the hats! you never have enough of them!"
ONE OF THE BEST GAME EVER MADE
"i love this game what i love the weapon,unusual,mvm,trade,hats,robot hats and badeg"
Has taken 100's of of hard earned cash from me and ruined my life on many occasions.  10/10 would bang harder next time.
Rip until they bring back pubs and get rid of casual

"Valve, i swear to god that if you guys don't fixed your god dammit casual match and bring it back the quick match and Pub. What happened ??, i seriously don't get it. 9 years and it supposed to be my best game i every play, i thought this update was something new that can change and i hope it get better, turn it it completely piece of ♥♥♥♥. i mean don't make it like Call of Duty Infinite Warfare. i really don't care about voting for heavy or pyro or new stuff anymore. GG valve, if you reading this or what ever, you should know that not only me who dislike this update and they want to bring the old tf2 back. pls valve.i have play long time enough to now that i was a fan of this game. :)"
THIS LAST UPDATE SUCKS
"i remember devoting all of my time and effort into this game back when i first bought it for $30 dollars solo at a best buy, and being super happy i could play it with my best friend. we played every single day for hours on end, but at one point some other games got my attention, and i played those instead, and after being on aproxamately a 4 or 5 year hiatus of playing tf2, i came back to it with the very same friend who also stopped playing.  and amazingly the game was still as we left it. Fun, Challenging and hillarious, the new balance changes in updates were fine, and we learned them well. and after another two years we stopped, to play other games as everyone takes a break once in a while. and we came back again, and loved it still, although the gunmettle update was rather similar to CS:GO we ignored it and enjoyed the game nevertheless  but as of 7/8/16, im sorry to say my 2k hours spent into this game, and how much this game meant to me, coming home to my friends and joining a match, and how easy it is to pick up and enjoy this timeless game, is all gone.  as of 7/8/16 Team fortress 2 is painfully Unplayable. as i read all of the other reviews of players with over 1k hours logged i feel just... sorry? i feel dissapointed that a game so many people enjoyed is just... gone.  people joked about it being Team Fortress: Global Offencive  or TF:GO i never thought it would ACTUALY HAPPEN,  so untill this is fixed, and valve listens to its community, im Out."
Good game but the new update Meet Your Match sucks ♥♥♥. Now I can't even play the game as my find a game button does not even work. If you have a solutions please help.
think game is so ♥♥♥♥ing trash why? just ♥♥♥♥ing kill me pls
"This is an amazing game, its so much fun to play with friends and you have so much stuff to do, i gurantee you wont get bored after a good 5 hours of playing. Overall Score: 9.5/10"
It is Amazing
"Got it on the Steam Summer Sale for a relatively good price, looks neat"
its a very good gameplay game recommended by many youtube channels good graphics . but im proud of the gameplay :-)
"I just started playing this game before the whole 'Meet Your Match' update, and even I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. This was starting to be an amazing experience for me, and Valve has completely broken the game.  I can't even get into a game. It just shows me how many other people are online/waiting to be put into a lobby and nothing happens. This is such a ♥♥♥♥ poor effort by Valve to make this game competitive. I think they should just roll the game back to how it was. Maybe then I'll actually get to play it."
"Can't find a game. Very unbalanced with classes like pyro and spy being almost useless. Do not recommend, waste of space. Community servers are a bad experience. Period. Used to be a decent game untul the heavyVpyro update."
IoGrgreat Game  
Overwatch update killed the game. 
Great Game Filled with many cosmetics and weapons to trade to my heart's content :D

BEST FREE TO PLAY GAME I EVER PLAYED IN MY HOLE LIFE SO STOP WATCHING AND START DOWNLOADING REMEBER IT FREE TO PLAY :D
"Team fortress 2 was originally a game I had disregarded, seeing it as a simple shooter game that wasn't worth my time. I gave the game a try and was fairly displeased it at first, however I came back to the game a year later and my opinion had been turned around completely. In a world of drab, bland and un-stylised modern video games, team fortress 2 stands out like a saw thumb, a unique and flavourful experience that provides near limitless amounts of fun and interesting content. From medieval mode, to Mann vs. machine, this game gives a more enjoyable experience than all other FPS games I have ever played. It runs smoothly, And you can customise the game to your heart's content, with a huge variety of advanced options, downloadable huds, weapons and character skins, sprays, and in-game purchases such as the world renowned hats. The game even has crafting, a competitive scene and 9 completely different classes to choose from. And that's what settled it for me. Each of the classes at first glance are simple, categorised, fill a certain role and 6 of them share identical melee, 4 of them share identical shotgun-secondary's. However, this is the best part, you can change up your loud outs, and become completely different classes altogether, such as the demo knight and battle-engineer. This will keep you coming back for years. The game modes are well thought out, well balanced, and are accompanied by maps that help you figure out where to go, lead you in the right direction, whilst providing enough flavour to be interesting to look at after the tenth time playing on the map, but don't take your eyes of your enemy. The Classes voice actors did a great job making each of the characters fleshed out and entertaining (and for me, especially the soldier and sniper) and each of the classes are well designed, so much so that even from a distance, wherein crazy hats and misc. items, you can still tell who is who and which team they are on, which is fantastic for a lot of people, especially those first getting to grips with the game. Overall, this game is a beautifully crafted First person shooter, that entices you to come back and play more, all for the wonderful price of NOTHING! (of course you end up spending tonnes on hats and keys, but maybe you might get lucky and sell a unusual hat on Christmas day for £91... :P ) "
"A meme (/ˈmiːm/ meem)[1] is 'an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture.'[by whom?][2] A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures.[3]  Unless you have a job or are 9 and have your moms credit card youre not getting far in the ranks.  Hat joke"
Plenty of options for unorthodox gameplay.
The game itself is amazing 10/10 99% of the community consists of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ F2Ps and campers. 0/10 community 11/10 hat simulator 9/10 game
This game sucks. Your life that is. Please send help.
"I see a lot of my self in the scout which makes him very relatable. I don't really like the other characters, and I especially hate the Heavy, as he is FAR TOO SLOW! Please nerf this Volvo"
"Simply an amazing game, i'd rate this 10/10 any day just because its so fun to play and to enjoy with your friends. theres multiple classes and game types to choose from including a co-op mode called (Man VS Machine) this is by far an outstanding game produce by valve and still very highly played to this day, valve continue to surprise there community with new events for each holiday with have and its simply a great game to play."
If you are not smart... the TF2 economy will eat you alive. It's a serious business
IS GUD GAME. WORTH ALL THE MONEY AND TEARS. DO BUY.

awesome game alot of excietment and good way to make friends
This game is a good game for anybody if you dont have epilepsy or a feint heart because it can get quite exciting. i Would recommend this game for anyone over 10-13
Like Skyrim with guns.
"Best FPS game ever. Seriously, just download this game already."
"Ive played this game for quite some time and had much fun in this game, it is quite original and a unique gem in the line of video games out there. For instance, I was walking around in Dustbowl and encountered an enemy pyro. Then astonishingly, he croutched down, pulled out an axe, and called me a 'spy' in friendliness. I did the same except with a shovel. Being a new Tf2 player and never seeing this behavior before, I scrounged the voice command list for 'spy'. Upon completing my feat of seeking the correct word, we walked toward eachother slowly, legs crouched, and stared at eachother, spamming 'spy'. We did this for a few moments until one of my team mates (soldier) came waddling himself down towards me and the pyro. He stared at us both in confusion, the little ghost dangling off his gibus in the fresh dusty air, and shot a rocket at the pyro, sending his body flying many yards away. Upon seeing my first Tf2 ragdoll, I burst into tears crying with laughter as the pyro's body fell through the air and made the 'squish' splat noise. Such a sight is unheard of in any other game and is quite common in this game. I am not a Tf2 fanboy, as I have grown up playing games like the Halo series my whole life since before I was 5, and playing CoD for a few years. I can easily say Halo is a very fun game, but that is another story. You will never find another experience like the ones you find in Tf2 nearly all the time every day, there is much laughter to have and enjoy in this game. 10/10 Is gud stuff. -Heavy"
"I, like many others have expressed here, am deeply saddened by the removal of the Quickplay Pub Valve servers in Meet Your Match update.   I bought Overwatch when it came out, but as I played it, the pressure to do well all the time, even in its casual gamemode, pushed me away from it. I found myself going back to TF2 to have some light fun on the official Valve servers to get my fps fix.  I have basically played TF2 since it was out, and at the start, pubbing on community servers was great (and all we had). But over time, it became increasingly hard to find decent to good servers (with good pings) to play on. Eventually Valve started offering official servers for quick play, which helped the problem of finding good servers. I could always count on finding at least 2-3 servers playing the map types I like with a decent ping. Now that they are gone, I'm not sure I want to play TF2 anymore.  Maybe there are good community servers out there still, but Valve has decided to remove the main pool of servers that were guaranteed to be good. I can't see myself having any fun with this update, and I would not recommend people coming back to TF2 until the Valve quickplay servers come back, as those are what made TF2 what it is, in my opinion.  Edit: I found a forum post that I feel explains how I feel about the sitation very aptly.  'It doesn't matter if Casual is a better mode than Quickplay. The fact is that it's vastly different. It is better in some respects, but it is worse in others. Even after it's fixed up (as I'm sure will happen), that doesn't change the fact that Valve took something away this patch. Something very core to the entire TF2 experience, and good or bad, we're stuck with it.'   http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=36270660&amp;postcount=8 "
"I have always been a CS player my whole life. I first notice this game when i watch a youtuber playing this game recently(of couse it's Muselk). After a few hours, this game is definately my new fav multiplayer game. Thanks Muselk for showing me this game!"
This is the best game i am playing so far ! Nice work Valve!
"Everytime I play this game I get sick and crazy, I stay with a great desire to drink my favorite drink: Bonk! with a sandwich, also feel like i want to dance conga the entire day while using a unusual strange genuine collector's vintage haunted decorated painted gibus hat... And i feel like a maggot.     10/10 Very good"
best game ive ever played no game that has EVER MADE ME STAY UP FOR SO LONG AND I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH I DONT DO MY HOMEWORK for school somethimes 
Great F2P game!
"Great FPS, its free, balanced (no better weapons) and there are so many mods to play, like dodgeball, saxton hale or deathrun or Mann vs Machine. premium account for only 1 item in mannco store isn't to bad, overall its my favorite shooter. I recommend to at least try the game."
Best Free game with fancy cartoon looking graphics. Very interesting gameplay and with the added class restriction custom matches.
THIS GAME WAS GREAT THERE WAS NO NEED FOR YOU TO DO THE STUPID THINGS THAT YOU DID I SELECTED 3 GAMES MODES DIDNT GET A GAME MODE IN 5 MINS WITH HIGH SPEED INTERNET AND UNLIMETED DATA THIS IS INSANE. IT WAS GOOD UNTIL YOU CHANGED CASUAL MODE I HATE THIS NEW UPDATE ALMOST WORTH NOT GETTING
It's awesome! Perfect game! 10/10 I love it!
Every Class is Different.  Every class is different. No two classes are the same.  Some classes are quick little bunnies. Scout is literally a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Some classes are batshit and insane. Ze Soldier should be institutionalized.  Some classes set people on fire. Ze Pyro is a soul-less monster! &gt;:C  Some classes have rigged ze enemy base with explosives! Demoman has not. He was too drunk.  Some classes are grossly obese. Ze Heavy is going to die of a heart disease.  Some classes build rediculously overpowered guns. Ze Engineer is compensating for something.  Some classes are sadisitic ex-Nazis. Ze medic hacks people apart for 'science'.  Some classes are polite. Some classes are efficient. Sniper throws his ♥♥♥♥ at people and lives in a van!  Some classes are sleeping with your mother~. Ze Spy is a dashing rogue.  Every class is different. No two classes are not actually Spy.  ZE END    
"A once great game that has been totally merkled by forcing half baked matchmaking on an unwilling community.  Now instead of playing TF2 you will spend 80% of the time searching for a game, waiting for a loading screen, waiting for players and staring at end of round scores.   You can no longer choose what map to play on, or region you play in, or even stop the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ matchmaking from putting you in a server with 400 ping. (this happens to me 1/3 connects)   When you do finally get a game, there is no voting hackers off, no scrambling for evening of teams, long periods of 12v8. Generally every game is a one sided stomp."
I think its about time i made a review for this game.  Just play it.
"This Is The Game That Made Me Come To Steam, Made Me Know About All Of The Hats And Tryhards/CoD Fanboys That Hate This Game, And HL3 So I Would Rate This Game.............. 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999/10. Cause Why The Hell Not?   CONGA CONGA CONGA!!!!!!!!"
It's like sex
"VERY Addicting. Well made game, and free as well."
Tf2 is fun 10/10
"what happens when you put a drunk scottsman, a bostonian, a fat russian, a crazy pyromaniac, a german doctor with a magic gun and the other colorful cast of characters together and pit them against eachother in game modes such as capture the flag, checkpoints and cart race? you get team fortress 2 a game of action, guns and most importantly = hats. this game brings everyone a reason to keep playing wether its completing your hat collection, collecting every item in the game that interests you, or smacking people silly with a fish wrapped in newspaper and christmas lights."
"In its current state i can't even enjoy tf2 anymore. Quickplays gone, I cant pick a map, and it takes ages to get into a map. Comp is horrible(atleast for me) becaused after waiting 20 minutes to get into a match a player abandons. Pt 2- Came to update it. Valve you have made this game a living hell. CAPPING ON HIGHTOWER, 30 minute wait times, HACKERS WITH 600 OURS WTF. I cant anymore. I loved this game but now i cant. Want proof of the hacker he the profile    http://steamcommunity.com/id/poniesftw/ "
Totally awesome hat simulator. And a really well balanced shooting mini game in it.
Great game 10 out of 10
"Best game free to play game on steam! If youre tired of mvm and valve servers? thers versus saxton hale, deathrun, prop hunt, and many other cool mods! download immediatly!"
Cool Game :) 
It's ok I guess.
Over all tf2 is a great game and everyone should atleast have a go at it keep up the good work valve!!!!
"despite not playing for a long time, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that this game is great.  ***EDIT*** i hate this game -10/10 no nookie"
"Really wish there was a meh button because that is exactly where i am right now, it can run normally and register your hits or it can give you utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t games where point blank shots to the face can be dodged, the game is incredibly responsive sometimes and other times you can shoot somebody 5 times and they just laugh it off because they get 0 dmg. Another very annoying thing you might see is insta kills, it's possible to be insta killed by insane weapons like the direct hit on the soldier, it's bassically an abomination that is an rpg and sniper at the same time.  Then comes the community which is either kids who can't type, kids who pretend there's 0 bugs in the game and that you should ''git gud'' while they get slaughtered and actually helpful people that will perhaps listen and actually reply without having a seizure."
go play day of defeat or counter strike instead see other negative reviews
"This game used to be real fun. but then the updates came. first came the csgo skins. in the same update, they nerfed all the decent weapons to appeal to the forum dwellers that cant get used to the game, making them complain about guns they were bad at using, i.e. the axtinguisher, baby face blaster, and the phlog. along other various unneeded changes to the other weapon's stats. after that, it was all downhill. 6 years of me playing everyday got shot down when they added the rank system as well as other various changes to the base game. this made tf2 unenjoyable. it was one of the top played games on the f2p market place, now its way lower in population. now alot of the tf vets have called it quits. this game has become so broken no one wants to play. valve doesnt care about team fortress anymore. rip my hats and stranges ;_;"
New update ruined the game!!!
its alright i guess
"I have spent over 800 hours in this game. There were many, many great memories. Rest in peace TF2."
"This game is the gratest game in the world its exiting and funny, and U meat new friends!"
...........It's TF2
MvM is has been broken for a few years and filled with bugs that valve is refusing to address.
"THESE IS THE BEST GAME EVER, IS FREE, IS AWESOME, IS .... VERY VERY VERY VERY COLL. PLAY NOW TEAMFORTRESS 2!!!"
"very good game, love it"
It is Free.
"Team Fortress 2 is one of the best 'cartoon' action games I have played in a VERY long time. The heavy loadout is just an epic classic. The sniper loadout is one of the ones I used the most, very trustable to use when in battle on this game, and all I can say is, EPIC game.   Suggested by me totally :)"
"This game has been around for a while now, and I can see why. Definitely a great game if you like FPS' and/or multi-player action shooters. It's free to play too, so it's all great!"
I love this game!
  10/10  
"very good, very fun"
One of the best game i've ever played and it never get OLD!!! :D
"BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED AND IT'S FREE!!! Like my god, this game has been my life for the past 3 years. I love it so much.  10/10."
It's alright
CONGA IS OP VALVE PLEASE NERF  10/10
"Incredible game, Packed with enjoyment as the gamemodes are endless. Never gets old with a infinite amount of hats and weapons to collect. I would certinetly download Team Fortress 2 right now, no questions asked. Enjoy you're Gibus Free to Plays Everywhere :D"
Not enough hats.  0/10
"Basically, there's a lot that goes into this game. It's unlike CoD, Battlefield, or any other FPS you've ever played. Which is why TF2 tends to be such a polarizing game. 'omg can't shoot through glass fix this broken game' It's an easy game to learn, but impossible to master. Really. It's definitely possible to get extremely good though. If you're picking this up for the first time, spend some time offline with bots to learn the mechanics of a few classes. But if you feel good enough that you want to jump into a Valve server or other pub server, the first class you should play as is medic. 'ugh but medic doesn't get any sick 360 no-scope kills' Yeah, no, he doesn't. But he's a HUGE reason why any team wins a match, so even if you're absolutely terrible at the game, as long as you're healing people, you're helping way more than you know. And you're learning the maps while not putting yourself at a huge risk. P.S., 360 no-scoping isn't a thing. Don't worry. As for balance, this game is pretty much great in that department. All the stock weapons for each class are as good as they get, anything else has a downside to it. The class balance is the best that it gets. Certain classes have different strengths and weaknesses, and the more you play, the better you'll get at knowing which class to play when, and when to not play certain classes, and which maps are better suited to different classes. I'm not too much into the trading scene, though the little bit of experience I've had it's been quite enjoyable. Just make sure you do your research so you're not selling your buds to someone for a single scrap. (Just look up the terms. You'll understand eventually) Even better, if you get mad at the game and want to ragequit, don't. Just go be annoying and instead of trying to get kills, go around with the frying pan just hitting things. You'll feel better. I promise."
What can I say? the only online multiplayer fps that i got good at in my life... Game's great Characters are great Gameplay's great It's almost the best online fps ever created  But.. sadly the community has gone to ♥♥♥♥. 
"Verry good game, would reccomend to others"
Hats. Need I say more?
"Interesting gameplay, but gets boring pretty fast. I'll give it a 9/11"
Verry entertaining. Much addiction. Many tryhard rage - Pic related.
"Really solid fps with probably some of the best movement a game could offer. Everything feels fluid and the only thing keeping you from getting better is you (with a few latency exceptions).   Why is this game not a recommendation then?   The clutter of updates that came in too late and just bog the game down. Yes, people may have left the game after 9 years but look at my hours and how many hours a lot of people have in this game: it was a success. I loved this game before, but in the past year I've lost my love for it due to the clutter and it just getting a little old. The only way I feel this game can offer any real fun is through community competitive play (ugc or esea) rather than valve's implemented system, which usually only ends in disappointment through people leaving, toxicity, and the like.   Overall, I don't really know how to feel about this update yet, all I know is that after 7 years of playing I can no longer just hop into a valve server and rocket jump, which was the last thing that kept me playing this game. Perhaps it's a bit biased, but I can't help but feel that the immediate effect of this update is going to be nothing but bad for the game. It was already dying and I feel that this may weed out the few who hop in just to have casual fun. A competitive structure is healthy for most games, but this just seems like a bad move. I guess we can wait and see mr gabe."
"Would not reccommend, not enough hats."
"This game is tons of fun, it's very team based and has lot of weapons. Game is very addictive and you will play it for hours. Highly recomended 9/10."
They messed up
"Team Fortress 2 is a game about a skilled team of hats battling to one up eachother in a ruthless economy of sharks, scammers, and lowballers. In this game you will find your place among the five factions that are constantly battling to control the power of hat prestige. There are: The Gibus Noobz, 360noSwaggots, The Hax0rz, The UnusualElite, and The Tikes_with_Mics. No matter which faction you choose, you will find yourself immersed in the colorful world painted over with sprays of dancing cats and Brony Porn. You will meet all different kinds of friendly Russians that want nothing more than to give you free hats at the low low price of your account password and complete trust. You will find yourself in awe of the average players complete inability to destroy an immobile turret. but most importantly you will stay up late, you will spam the chat boxes, and you may even lose your soul in the ultimate pursuit of the Burning TC. Do you have what it takes to control the ultimate collection of virtual hats?"
"Evan though the newest update isn't that great, the game is still fun. I recommend this game"
"I have had this game for quite a while, and I have had many great times playing it. But I feel the need to express my distain for the new update since it has changed so many features in pursuit of fixing one problem.  The new matchmaking update has fixed the problem of matching up low skilled players to high skilled ones. But it has also changed the way most of the set up for the game works. You can no longer choose which map for gamemode you want to play, its all up to matchmaking, as well as the very long waiting times to find a game.  And I also believe that this matchmaking has taken away experiances and tricks we can learn from high skilled players, thats how people learn how to get better. Watching good players inspires others to try their techniques, and in turn, they get better themselves. This is how ive always learned hwo to play the game.  The fact that these options have been taken away from me and all other players has driven me to feel the need to write such a review, and I sincerely hope that changes will be made to return the game back to how it was before the update."
"I really likED this game. Before new update, I used to play for fun on random pub servers. Now, Valve removed pub(???WHY???). Now, there is rating system and no place for fun. Matches and rating system are excellent for TF, but no pub servers for fun. Its killing me. Valve, please, GIVE OUR PUB SERVERS BACK!"
"I loved this game and after a while of playing it i took a pause and came back some months after, and the 'CS' update had ruined the game experience for me, i dont recommend this game at this piont of time R.I.P TF2"
this poorly optimized piece of trash needs to get out with their trash overhyped update smh
Team Fortress 2 is an AWESOME game!!!!!! Even if you have a bad computer you will be able to process it.     P.S. If you are new to TF2 wwatch out for spies.
Hands down one of the best games i have ever played. there is so much to do whether it being slaughtering the enemy to a pulp in payload or just chilling back on a trade server there is something for everyone.
"This. If you don't have this game, you don't know about the best FPS fun you can have online! Yeah, it's tons better than Call of Duty."
i love it wow oh
"Would definetely recommend checking this game out (it is free). Had a lot of fun and made a lot of good friends through this game, and would like to see others do the same."
no i had enough the update made tf2 dead RIP TF2 2007-2016 'was a good shooter but now a waiting simulator of getting ONE match it will be missed...'
The best game to spend all of your money on.
I've never met someone who doesn't have Team Fortress 2 in their steam library
"I would like to make it clear right now, I love this game. I love it to death. However, in it's current state, I do not, under any means, recommend playing this game. And I will tell you why.  #1) Hacking This game is Valve Anti Cheat secure. However, every time i play this game, i see hackings so unbelievable and so rage inducing, that I think 'Maybe I didn't see it at all?' Until, of course, it happens again. And again. It leaves the game horribly unbalanced. And when you attempt to kick them for hacking or cheating, everyone defends them. Why? Because the hacker is either on their team, or they are friends with the hacker. They end up kicking you for greif in the end.  #2) Underage Children I am going to say now, I don't mind when kids play videogames. However, if I'm a medic who is healing a dying soldier, and a Heavy (played by child) walks by harassing my ♥♥♥ asking for me to heal their 100% health for no reason (by spamming the 'medic' button), I'm going to get ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Not to mention in this Free-To-Play format, the game is then given no security from under age children who, in reality, should not be playing this game. There are kids that have told me to 'Stop saying naughty words' in a game where the Soldier says 'Damn' and '♥♥♥' all the time. I'm an adult and can say '♥♥♥♥' if I die. (sorry)  #3) Unbalanced gameplay Team scrambling happens as a public vote that is given to both teams. If one team is kicking another teams ♥♥♥ super hard, why would they want the teams to be scrambled? They wouldn't They will vote against it every time, making the game super unbalanced in the favor of the winning team.  #4) Mann Vs Machine (particularly Mann Up) I love the Mann Up missions but when they gave out a ton of free tickets, the servers got flooded with people who were bossy and demanding. I got kicked from servers for my gender and my preffered loadout so many times. Now I'm on a lower slot of the server wait-list because of it.  What would fix it?  I'll be honest and say Free-To-Play sounds super awesome. However so does everyone else. But what could prevent most of the problems would be charging for the game. That way, children need permission from their parents to purchase it and it gets rid of, not all of the problems, but a few of them. I'm not saying this because I baught it in the past. I started playing this over a year ago. And for a 9 year old game, i'm still impressed. However in it's current condition, it's a disappointment. And unfortunately, it's aggravated me to the point of almost quitting it for good."
Most fun shooter ever :3
TF2 is life TF2 is love TF2 is passion
"Well... How do I talk about a game which dosen't really have a purpose? How do I convey the hours of enjoyment I've gained... if I haven't been doing anything useful. This game... now this game is not a first person shooter. It is a hat simulating, conga lining, unusual trading, strange gathering, killstreak hoarding, taunt collecting piece of beautiful magic that we are lucky to have graced the earth. Deeper into the game you encounter hours of fun which are never the same no matter what you play! This my friends.. is the only game in my WHOLE STEAM LIBRARY THAT I PLAY. not to mention that its free. (If you want to be a gibbus noob)  One thing i must say: download this game. It's not serious; its a joke. but its the best joke ever told."
"Very Fun, Lots of Things to do + some good Classes you can pick from"
"This is one of the most free to play games i played in my life is so complete and cool, Valve do a vey good job with this game, and the updates are extremly epics, like love and war, or mvm, this game is perfect for any gamer."
"In a suprise plot twist, this game is a reskin of the GameSphere classic Hat Simulator 2025"
"Well, 1,500+ hours really does say something. The main focus of this game isn't the shooting part. Oh no... Its the gad-damn HATS.   Anyway, ruined my life 10/10"
it a good game 
"It's free, Why would you NOT get this game, Plus it's great fun"
"What this game offers that many people have not discovered is the true love for cosmetic items. Perhaps this game offers a money-making scheme not popular in others and captures it perfectly within the hearts and souls of countless gamers, who no doubt enjoy the pleasure of recieving their item of no true monetary value yet being worth more than what they gave in (despite the fact that they've probably spent enough money to make any sort of compensation worthless).  Truly a 10/10, at least 2 years ago.  now its a steaming pile of dogshit with updates that break the game more than making it. Plus its nearly been out for 10 years so gg"
This is one of the top games on Steam and I love it.
"This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fulfill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels. The game has an active dev team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons or game modes.  At the time of this review, there are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'.  Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objective or objectives for each team to achieve.  'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, 'Mann Up', gives rewards upon completing a 'tour'.  In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available.  In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them.  The game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play. I have been playing since December 2014 and I still return to the game on a regular basis."
This game Can be Really Funny
Great game for free 2 play players. Countless hours of fun!
"Team fortress 2 is unlike any other game ever, its a game where the community rules and they have a say in almost everything, from voting for the top maps to getting their dream items into the game. and the best part is Its Free to Play for everyone. I recommend this game to people who want a difference in a shooter who want originallity in what they play. If you believe that then i recommend team fortess 2 to you."
this game is one of the best and most fun massively multiplayer fps out there and its free. what more can you ask for.
Good game fun silly and best of all free. Game gets better if you invest into it. If you can't thats ok there are a lot of kick butt free to players.
Best F2P FPS to have fun with xD many cool classes and many more weapons with awesome features
An awesome game that everyone should play! Different classes for different people! Great game by far which is really fun when playing in groups of friends.
one of the best games ever made
Get it. It's good. It has hats.
"Nice game and free, although I'd like it to have more co-op content..."
"I LOVE this game it is basically a first person, cartoon violence shooter and in some servers you can go in third person it is a really fun game with craftable, tradeable weapons, qualities, and player accesories. it is personally one of my favorites and i suggest you check it out"
this game is fun and good i get steam xp point for game review thanks
"Very good game, love it :3"
the best game ever 
"a very good game and one of the best free to play games of all time. A highly accesible First Person Shooter game that is easy for gamers of all skill levels to learn. Online is heaps of funs with friends and the classes are extremely unique from one another. you feel like you don't need to buy anything at all to enjoy the full game. Overall an amazing game and completely free to play. i am horrible at first person shooters so coming from a person like me, thats a pretty damn good game"
did not ruined my life..b-baka
"Rich, gorgeous and endlessly fun.  "
I started playing this game with 60 fps. I returned to this game with 10 fps.
this game is so dope u should really play it . I cant stop playing this thats how good this ♥♥♥♥ is. the ♥♥♥♥ u buy is awesome too i love all the gun and each one is different. another good game made by Valve
Modern Quake  10/10 Introduced me to Steam
"I'm not sure what to say. It's by far one of the best multiplayer games I've ever played, and it's definitely a game you will always come back to. I love the fact that it's a widespread war game AND an excellent hat simulator, all in one. I would definitely recommed this game to anyone I know. It is worth the twenty dollars, and then all the money you spend in-game."
"Don't quite know why I'm wiritng a review, as 90% of my Steam friends already own this. There are about a billion things I like in TF2. If nothing else, it's probably like one of three FPS in existence that isn't shades of brown and gray and dark green. I'm a little colorblind, so the classic red-versus-blue team colors and bright white/tan scenery is really helpful. Also, there's no way to play both dumb and well. Every class is a specialty class, with their weapon loadouts creating distinct strategies that are great or terrible depending on your current objective. And while there is an established meta-game, it changs every time stats are tweaked or new weapons added, so the game is always evolving. Finally, some of the most fun I've ever had has been on private servers, running around, blasting crits, accomplishing objectives that we all just understood. Now if only there were an easy way to adjust the settings so I'd lag less..."
Love TF2! Its my favourite game to lightly play with friends and even get really into it too! GReat for all ages. :P
"I like to sit in a corner and eat my sandvich in peace, you know?"
"After having played this game for 100's of hours I finally know every single phrase that all 9 characters are able to say in all possible situations. I use these phrases in real life and needless to say I have lost numerous amounts of friend by doing this. I fear I might be going insane. Help me please.  10/10 became an anxious, antisocial, hat-wearing, videogame-quoting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  WATCH OUT BOIIS IT'S A SPAHH!"
Quinn's infamous hat menu curse started here...
its a fun game to play with friends!
"Dare I say this is the greatest FPS ever made? Indeed I do. Ladies and gentlemen, put down your dumb Calls of Duty and protect points!"
This is the best free to play war themed hat simulator I personally have ever played Solid 3/5 Neopets
Favourite game &lt;3 This is the best free game I have ever played and have spent every day possible on it since i joined October 2011!
  20 dollar tf2 was better
"Ruined my Brain, time &amp; Wallet, 10/10. Recommended to family, friends &amp; just about anyone else. (you too, obama.)"
"Let me just say this, I have always, for the past four years playing this game, loved it. Every second I could get on and either join a community server or a normal server, I loved it. Being able to play this game with a bunch of my friends was the best thing to pass the time, but now, Valve has gotten so lazy and so unpassionate about their game that I don't even want to come back to witness the monstrosity that it has become. Sure, they might fix it in the future, but still, the game's only been going down a steep hill ever since the Gun Mettle update came along. TF2 had such original ideas for new content, only to be struck down by a bunch of reskins and comsetic updates. Not to mention, we've been hyped up for so many updates like Halloween or Christmas, but really, all we got were reskins, taunts and cosmetics. But it all came spiraling down once the Meet Your Match update came into reality. They ultimately removed quickplay and replaced it with casual and competitive. Not to mention, if you leave casual, you get a cooldown. But if you leave a competitive game, you're fine. Not to mention, competitive isn't free, you have to pay TWENTY DOLLARS FOR IT. If TF2 was still the same as it was back one year ago, I would definetley reccomend this game, but now? Not at all. It's just a mere cash grab for Valve."
"Basically a good first-time-game, if you want to play shooting games. Graphics are unique when you compare it to other pvp games. A big shop with a lot of clothing and free weapons makes the game more interesting, in a way that the users can get creative and style their own characters. Nine classes, makes the game more challenging and less boring, as you can just switch class when you feel like it. The videos about the characters and their histories are absolutely terrific and the medic is something you don't see in every game, as you heal with a medic-gun and shoots with this incredible 'syringe shooting gun', where in other games it's often a character with a medic-back and often with normal (often normal) guns or in use of some type of magic. Also is the game always active with players and new products in store. In all is the game catchy and available for everyone."
been playing this for a while now eversince a buddy of mine told me about it a few years ago. definatly worth a shot if you dig fps.
"addiction?! i guess you could say, i 'hat' that coming "
Awesome game the best ever
"One of the best game I ever played..The game is awesome.It has tons of guns to achieve or craft.I think the game has ruined my life.The best free to play game ever for me.Love the game,It is one of my most favourite game.Whoever doesn't tried it I suggest you to try the game.You will surely get fun playing the game.."
This is a state of the art hat simulator with a bit of interesting combat on the side! Hoarde the hats and throw money at Valve! YEAH!
"Fun game, fast paced action and overall just a very good game. Best hat simulator ever. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
10/10 Got beaten to death by a flying drunk black Scottish cyclops with a frying pan.
hat trading game!
the best game ever
Its fun.
new update has utterly destroyed the game. bring back pubs
To everyone from Valve corporation. YOU BROKE THIS GAME BADLY!!!!
"I´d like to give this game 10/10. BUT, i can´t do that. If valve would remove random crits, add a competitive servers, and just balance some bad weapons overall. Other than that, this game has (somewhat) balanced gameplay, classes and weapons. I like it."
"Spent a thousand hour in the game, been addicted for years. Spent tens, if not hundreds of dollars on in game items that do me nothing but give me a higher priced BP If this keeps up I may lose all contact of the outside world and may not be able to pay the bills or buy food next month 11 Hats out of 10"
"Good game, its more fast game, if u like these kind of games you will love TF2, i mean its like, pum pum pum, killing all the mothe♥♥♥♥as"
A lot of ppl and lots of fun members to meet!  if you want a game to become fully addicted to  Then this is your game
is beatifull game 20/10 BEST GAME DOWLOAD NOW!!!!
"Heck, I just want the badge but I've played this game a lot and as long as you don't love virtual cosmetic stuff too much you can play perfectly well without spending anything on it. You probably know that already though."
fun but spys are everywhere
Definately addicting... This game could probably be on the market for a hundred dollars and still attract millions of people.
"Pros: The most fun you can have online, now free! Balanced Gameplay You get to meet all 9 men by videos intense first person shooter awesome less 5 year olds play this instense Co-op game MvM  Cons: This game is more a hat simulator than a first person shooting game If you are an f2p, there is likeky a chance a rude p2p ban you going on a trade server as an f2p will get you banned crates count as useful items for p2ps, crates count as garbage for f2ps. raging 5 year olds are replaced with annoying giant mouthed thailand kids p2ps only like to have fun with another p2ps, but they screw f2ps. sometimes, as an f2p,a p2p will add you, then ask you to trade. If you ignore it. They will report you almost all items here require money. CoD snipers added here. valve will ask you MANY times to become an p2p. Which is annoying  I really recommend you to get this when your a fps fan. I really not recommend you to play this when you hate premium ppl  "
"this game is love, this game is life."
yes it is good game :3
This is an amazing game and I absolutely love it. It's Free to Play so there isn't really a reason to not try it.
Fun with friends. Recommended with friends. Good place to make friends .-.
This is a real fun and great game to play!
"The best MMOFPS the free-to-play can offer. Lots of content (and constantly updated). Weapons can be dropped during gameplay, so you don't have to 'pay-to-win' (and there is no gun that is clearly superior to other or even stock item). The thing you probably will have to pay for are HATS! They rarely offer more than make you look cool, so if it's just gameplay you want, then you don't even have to pay a penny.   Class-system is well-covered. there is no strict 'rock-paper-scissors' game where one class can be used to counter other (ok, it is, but the countered class still might win if played right).   While mechanics are good and rather solid, the game experience might be something else. If you stick to valve servers, it's good. but there are those custom servers on which if you pay, you basically get cheats in-game. AVOID THAT! speaking of custom, there are a lot of user-generated maps, mods etc. that might even expand the gameplay in a ways, that can make even a different game (I recommend Prop Hunt for example).   Personally, The game was worth it's money before and now, when it's free-to-play it's totally worth to try at least."
This game? AWESOME!
fun and awsome 
this game changed my life!!!!!!!!!!!! 
"Never going back to wasting money on , 'Call of Duty'. . . they simply have been outclassed from the number of hats."
A very fun free to play game
"BEST HAT SIMULATOR EVER, but at the moment, the economy is dying (be cautious)"
This is a game that simulates the real world hat trade. Be the envy of your friends and family with a complete set of hats and weapons. See a hat you dont have? Well beg to your hearts content. 10crates out of 10. would buy again if i could.
i would recommend this game cause its the best game in the universe!!
my first steam game :3
"The Trading System Is Great, Small Bug here and there. But Overall are Team Fortress 2  is a Great Game, Both Competitive Player and as a 'Trader'  The Community is Okay, Alot Scammers and People that try to cheat you."
"I definitely recommend this to new players, as it is both free to play and a great team-based game."
I played it a little while 10/10 it's ok
Team fortress 2 is a very funny and awesome game^^  And the multiplayer is awesome too.
I'm still playing after 4 years.
"Been playing this for a few years now, just can't stop playing it! Such addictive, much time consuming, not boredom."
This gam is FUN!!!!!!
Just love the game. Allot fun if you can play with your friends.
"The best video game in the history of video games ever made , and will be made."
Took my life. Took my money. Took my social life. 11/10 would play.
"I spent more of 1000 hours of my life playing this game.  I entered into a Hat store and offered Refined Metal as payment. The seller understood the reference, now we are friends &lt;3  Recomended, TF2 makes real friendship"
it's awesome and it's free 10/10 would pay for hats again :D
Awesome game definately recomend to anyone who does not have plus it is free to play
I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME!
"This is probably the best game I have ever played to date. It is free to play, but to really play the game you have to buy something from the Mann. Co. store. But you can choose to pay $00.49 or $02.50 or $99.00 so compared to a $60 CoD game, this is a good price. The gameplay is also amazing, incredibly balanced, there will never be a class that doesn't have a counter. (Unless said class is extreme major pro mega supa deluxe gamer.) And then, the hats. You can't have a good game with out looking good. So go download TF2, buy yo self a key, (what I most reccomend) and go kill some dudes and have fun at the same time and not worry about your K/D ratio.  Also never open crates. You end up with poop."
50% off best deal ever
"Don't play this game.  You might think it's an award-winning FPS, but it's actually a high school--cliques, man, CLIQUES.  There are the traders who try to make money off of this game, the gibus F2Ps, the comp snobs (I'm one of them), the comp superstars, the too-good-for-pubs people who pubstomp, the people who make videos, and the modders.  There are also hackers, scammers, phishers, spoiled 12-year olds and all around ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  Wait--wait what? You mean every online FPS is like that? Oh. Oh. Nevermind. Play this game. The hats are pretty silly."
It's alright.
"Team Fortress 2 is not only a game based on killing each other, but it is a game revolving around one thing. Hats. Basically, if you don't have a hat in Team Fortress 2, you're not playing it right. You should definetly put something on your head to cover that bald spot. Play Team Fortress 2."
"The new update ruined the game. i'm disappointed valve, very disappointed..."
"Competetive or Bust update honestly killed TF2. Until they replace quickplay, I doubt i'll be playing much anymore."
"How can I describe TF2? Well, if you don't know what it is, you've been living under a rock for the past 7years and you should play this game. At first you'll be confused but It's an awesome game! LEARN TO PLAY GAMES INSTEAD OF GETTING MAD AT THEM. THIS SERIOUSLY IRRETATES ME WHEN PEOPLE SAY THIS GAME SUCKS BECUASE IT'S F2P OR BECAUSE IT'S TOO CONFUSING. Rant over."
"If you like hats, and spending money on hats, this game was crafted for you"
you're not hardcore if you don't like hats
"One of the most exciting and interesting FPS. Good looking game, Good graphics. I give it 9.8/10. -0.2 (Must premium to trade)."
This game is great. It's fun.
"THE MOST FUN you could have with an FPS (if you can call it that) on the internet...  Pros: -Free to play entirely (you can aquire everything in the game-even the most expensive items-by just playing and learning the game) -Terrific spin on the FPS genre (so many querky and hilarious playstyles, rocket jumping, ubering, sentrys...the list goes on) -Terrific community (Both in the competitive scene and steam workshop-who valve will often consult to introduce new items) -A great game to enter if you are looking to play competitvely -Most of the time, valve endeavours to answer the community with patches and updates (however have been know to leave things alone for extended periods of time) -Great user accessibility-is that even a thing O.o (servers easy to join, game modes for everybody, gives the ability to mod if you wish)  Cons (not really sure) -Traditional FPS players may take some time to get uses to the games mechanics -Projectile Spam on Dustbowl -Right now, the phlog..*sigh valve* -Honestly can not think of any, most bad things end up turning into fun entertainment and hilarity(?).  I have made the majority of my steam friends from this game and have experienced the many memorabel moments playing over the past 5 years. I have a special thig in my heart for this game as really the first time I got into the PC gaming scene  Rated 9.9/10  I would rate this game perfect but the latest patch needs to be repatched (balances and buffs have turned into game winning changes...(pls valve, why you do dis?)  jks 1000000/10 would play for all of eternity!"
this game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks
"Such guns, much hats, so amaze, wow."
its a awesome game
Its a fun game and cool stuff like the bread update that added a bread box and new items for few classes
A realy cool First person shooter that let's you kick some noob's ♥♥♥ it's a realy good game once you start getting hats (premium) and there are also a lot of weapons you can choose.there are 9 classes for you to choose and every one of em' is good so...you better get going and download this badass game that is for everyone (free to play).so go on bro-s and non-bros and break some ♥♥♥♥♥♥'s bones.Good Luck :3
"is you are the beginner or Professional gamer, then this is for you"
Conga conga conga! i love the conga!
"Before I started tf2, my life was a dark pit fulled with hatless misery every waking moment of the day. The first moment I walked out of spawn on 2fort, I saw a teammate offer me a high five. From that moment on, I knew i was never going to put this game down. 1100 hours and counting later, Team Fortress 2 fills up the majority of my time, whether its messing around on pubs, trading hats for even better hats, or playing with my Highlander team, Team Fortress 2 is truely the most fun you can ever have with an online game.  11/10 would reccomend"
i USED to have girlfriend my own life my own aim to life BUTT dis gaem ruined all dis and i luv it from it i r8 8/8 IGN m8 or 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10 Pootis  THANK you lord gaben for ruining my life i love u for it and im looking forward to matchmaking
"I could go on and on about how this game is great and stuff like that, instead, one word: HATZ!  Yes I would recommend, even to my GF, 10/10!"
"Wow, just wow lol. I played this game for 2 years now and still as fun when I first played it, recommend this to anyone. 8/10"

"Everybody knows what TF2 is, I am just gunna say I like it. :)"
"This update...disappointing.  Huds dont work well for me.  The worst part is the dumb update makes it so that you cant pick what map u want in your game mode,and if u click start search it takes hours to join a game and if you quit you qet a penalty time."
"Valve for goodness sakes return quickplay, this is not on"
"Great game, fun to play, as well as free to play."
"This honestly is the best game I have ever played. It's entertaining and just fun. There are so many gamemodes, classes and weapons to choose from. If your looking for a F2P game this is the one."
Essentially the most epic dressup game ever. This one also features guns!
"I remember buying this game, way back then, in a store, as a physical, in-box game. I remember when hats weren't a huge deal in this game, when people went to achievement maps not to inflate their achievement scores but for the weapons that were linked to achievements, when the halloween update first started. I laughed at the time everyone was freaking out about Bill's Hat being added to the game as it was the first promotion from another game linking with Team Fortress 2. Can recall staying up well into the early hours of the day playing this game with friends years ago.   Wish I spent more time playing back then, because, now, the game that I once loved is gone. It was fun being able to do stupid things in random servers, most of the time getting both teams to go along with it. I remember one match where my friends and I managed to make everyone go Jarate sniper, another where we had everyone play scout with the pan or bat if they didn't have it. Unfortunately, on top of the changes that valve has made to the game, the community has changed as well. Many more people are competitive even in public games and, with the latest update adding ranking in casual games, it doesn't help the situation any. Go into a server and try to have everyone go along with a themed game. Some people will probably tell you to screw off the moment you join the server.  I suppose I'm conflicted. I'd like the game to still be a cool, silly, screw-the-competitive-side-of-things game; however, people have been asking for a ranking system for a long time. Unfortunately, I don't believe this update delivers what people've been asking for."
"Fun experience with bad hit detection, constant influx of bugs, exploits, inexperienced players and hackers. The game's so good I started playing alone with bots and never came back playing how it suppose to be played. Guess what. LAN still has hit detection issues. UPDATE: setting cl_interp to 0, cl_interp_ratio to 0 and cl_updaterate &amp; cl_cmdrate to 66.7 (or 67), makes LAN game much more responsive. Still not perfect but definitely better.  However, gameplay wise, I find TF2 to be a pretty fun experience. Especially being a f2p game. It really is far from being a pay2win game. Free2players are not missing a lot compared to premium players either. Small backpack might be the worst aspect of being a f2p. Other than that, f2p or premium, both have equal power. Now only experience, skill and cooperation matters --------------------------------------------------  Rant on Gun Mettle update.  INTRODUCTION TF2, since the hat update (I guess) became a cash cow but now with the Gun Mettle, the game reached a whole new level of ♥♥♥♥♥iness.  If you're familiar with CSGO (of course you are. How many times you heard 'TF:GO' or 'the game is leik csgo nao' when that update happened?) you know about the skins and most likely about StatTrak thingy.  We know how Valve greedy (many options to waste money in games such as DOTA, TF2, CSGO; paying for mods which thankfully this idea died shortly; ridiculous prices for items in TF2, CSGO, maybe DOTA too) and lazy (Workshop items - content created by community, not Valve; updates usually come with more bugs than content) they are. So how about we adapt the CSGO skins and StatTrak ideas to TF2? - says some smart Valve employee. The Gun Mettle update was born.   MAPS An update lacking anything new (since skin idea was taken straight from their other game + the whole skin idea originated in COD franchise if I'm not mistaken) came with handful of maps that existed before TF2 map workshop even existed.  We were finally introduced to Snowplow map! A map that was supposed to be released in the worst TF2 update so far: The End of the Line update. This update could have been kind of decent with this map (which would be the only new gameplay related aspect of this update) but no. Cosmetics were again the biggest concern. Why this map was not included in this update? Because, according to Valve it was 'too confusing and challenging for new players' [Source:  http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Snowplow ].  Here comes the Gun Mettle update and here comes Snowplow. Is map 'Snowplow' no longer confusing and challenging for new players? That's some low grade excuse right there. Good job including this map now. New players come every day and now the map will still remain as confusing and challenging (yea, right) for them as it would in winter 2015, as if new players have no other choice but to play Snowplow only...  WEAPON REBALANCE Yet another weapon rebalanced came with this update and it happens to be a thing TF2 player should be most concerned about, which turned out to be both positive and negative feature of this update. Nothing more to say here. Some weapons got buffed enough to become useful and yet those weapons haven't become overpowered and some guns has been nerfed to state that barely anyone will consider using them again.  As the pinnacle of this rather crap update come the whole skin fiasco.  SKINS This particular feature which has a big meaning to TF2 as well, since TF2 no longer is just a 'Hat Simulator'. No, no. Now it also is, what I would love to call, a 'Toy Gun Simulator' where people will be running with rather ugly skins, calling people noobs because your Strange, Vintage, Festive, Strange Festive, Botkillers, Collector's and Australiums are no longer hip. TF2 used to be all about decorative cosmetics, a ♥♥♥♥ing doll dress up game. Suddently, the freakin' guns became more important. The 'uniqness' of TF2 has been covered by the idea taken straight from Valve's competitive shooter. Is this an alright idea? Definitely. Definitely for Valve. People will pay for these either with keys bought from Mann Co Store or from Steam Market (fee)  Skins are not the only thing that got ripped off. The way you receive those skins are also taken straight from CSGO. Well, can't really tell how similar this thing is but one is certain. TF2 community used to get Strange and Festive weapons by unlocking crates with a key worth 2 Euros. Now anyone who wants to get a totally random (crate content was much more limited in quantity of items, making acquiring desired stuff a bit easier) skin with a random exterior quality needs to spend 5.50 Euros and if you happen to get a case which contains Stat Module (a straight StatTrak ripoff), or even a Stat Module + Unusual quality of your new toy (oh peelease...) spend another 2.30 Euros on a key. (Gabe N. don't read this next line) Or you can just wait till these will become cheaper, buy some, enjoy them (or not) and sell them later.  ABILITY TO SWAP WEAPONS If you ever played Counter Strike (no matter which one) or at least know a bit about it, it is possible to drop your weapon. TF2 never had this option till Gun Mettle became a reality (technically you swap weapons instead of dropping them). Why? Why you need such a useless crap now? How useful it is now? If it's still not obvious for you, dear reader, the answer is: it is still as useless as it always was. See, in Counter-Strike there are no classes. There are equal players you control and only team work and skill matters. You are being rewarded with money you spend on better weaponry and equipment. Such thing does not exist in TF2. WHY would you ever need to stop dead in your tracks just to swap the same weapon or to swap for a completely different weapon, most likely destroying your primary/secondary/melee build which can be chosen at ANY TIME in spawn anyway? The only place this feature would have come in handy is Randomizer mod and frankly it is still useless in every other official rules TF2 has. Enjoy somebody's gun. You'll lose it as soon as you get your ♥♥♥ fragged.  That's how Valve's TF2 greed reached a whole new level. Pathetic, embarrassing and lazy. Unfortunately it's good enough that people will be buying those, either from market, trading or by wasting 5.50 Euros or $6. Or maybe TF2 community will turn the tides? Yea, yea. TF2 weapon skin Workshop will be opened in next 1-3 months. Can't really predict when this will happen but I bet your ♥♥♥ this will eventually happen. Thankfully the TF2 still remains as TF2. Gameplay wise of course. It became a ♥♥♥♥ as soon as it hit f2p (which I happen to be a part of that ♥♥♥♥ that no longer litters Valve servers) but now it started to smell bad but not bad enough. Time to get back to Valve servers, not."
"It's bad for my health,already played 1,000+ hours 0.o"
Who doesn't love this game unless your insane.
"Wow -rep not enough pubs. Bringe back pubic server, volvo! kymsm11!!!! cringe! G.O.O.P #TeamCosby. Also, they removed 'quickplay' so now players h have to wait 5 minutes before playing a game! The games are also staged in first to two wins and ♥♥♥♥ so it doesn't take 40 mins for the under 1000 hour team to slug there gibus wearing hoobi's to the other intel. 0/gay not funi falvo. Tehy removed the 'Auto-balance' feature so the whiny sack of ♥♥♥♥ community is crying that they don't think it's fair that they're losing, even though it has jack ♥♥♥♥ to do with team size (I mean really, a good team can defeat a team double their size)   Oh yeah, LMAOBox is back, so I can double-hack in my favourite swag-deppressing, ♥♥♥♥♥♥-♥♥♥, butt-stink, ♥♥♥♥-face-community, lazy-piece-of-♥♥♥♥-falvo game."

"My favourite First-Person-Shooter! Incrediblly Fast-paced, huge map variability, lots of tactical Depth. Fun for Beginners and still great after 200 hours."
I got a hat.
Update has taken the fun out of a fantastic game.
Awesome game. It's also free which makes everyone be able to play it :D You can find items such as new weapons and if you are lucky a hat or a taunt. By trading you can also make giant profit.  I strongly recommend it. It's one of the best games in the world
gabe newell: hey guys ive been playing this new game overwatch for quite some time now and i gotta say this game is pretty fun we should really try copy some of the things there doing like adding competetive and maybe we should have a casual mode you know and remove pub mat....

Most fun you can ever find in a f2p game.
"'The God of all first-person shooter multiplayer in its gameplay, gamemodes, and hats.. oh wait. WUT?!' - Ashire   It's my own point of view, this game is legendary if you haven't experienced it, then you haven't lived. Hats with cool unusual effect, same for the guns, and hats. Never mind that as long as you were enjoying it, it's worth spending for. Trust me!"
"[SERIOUS REVIEW]  Right, so this is a very serious review of mine about Team Fortress 2. I've played already for quite awhile and I've seen some bad and good stuff already happen in this game. I've seen a group of Thai Kids insult an entire group of older people. I've seen the rise and fall of the game's economy.  But the game still stood alive with all sorts of problems and criticism that everyone gave. Okay, let's head to the real topic of this, the actual Review. Here, I'll be tackling about the 2 major aspects of the game, which are the game and the economy/trading. Let's begin shall we?  -Gameplay-  Alright, for those who doesn't know, this game has 9 different characters which are called 'classes'. By different, I mean VERY DIFFERENT. Each class has its own unique way of playing. Some may have similarities but they will NEVER EVER be the same. The gameplay is as interesting as it gets since you can do so many things while playing everywhere.  I like how this game is played. The controls are easy but requires mastery for it is NOT a tactical FPS Shooter but a rush FPS. Movement is very important and so is your aim (even if there is no hipfire spread). What makes this different from other games is that.....It has that, what we so call, Gameplay Uniqueness. It is totally different from games in todays FPS Genre for the physics here work very differently and for an F2P game, it really is pretty interesting.  Mechanics are pretty simple and easy to understand. Just like other FPS games, there are always objectives to finish. Like capturing marked points for your team, retrieving the enemy intel from their base and put it directly to yours. But there are also maps which do not have any objectives (or others DO NOT do the objectives) and just do a plain Team Deathmatch. Which I actually love the most.  More things about the gameplay aspect of this game is that, it is so random and as if it acts as a MOBA. Why a MOBA you ask? Easy to answer. Critical Strikes. You see, in other FPS Games, you have to actually have to hit vital parts of an enemy player (eg. the head) to actually do critical damage and get an instant kill. But TF2 is a different story. Random Crits appear out of nowhere from either your teammate, yours or even from the enemy. These so called Random Crits are always nuisance to all TF2 players trying their best in-game. What really cringes every TF2 player is when weak players always get random crits that kill the better players.  (eg. You are dominating a really annoying kid. But when that kid kills you with a random crit, the kid goes all mighty saying that he is more powerful than you)  -Economy/Trading-  Now this is the bread and butter of TF2. Without this, the game will never be called Team Fortress 2 since this game (most of the time) is known by its expensive 'only-game-existing' hats. Let me give you an example. There is this hat called a 'Team Captain'. And to make it expensive, you unbox it from in-game crates that gives an additional 'Unusual' name to it, thus making it 'Unusual Team Captain.' These unusuals have special effects that makes the hats glow, have sparkly/raining cloud designs floating on top of it. Heck, even dollars can float around it!   These unusuals sell for a very big amount due to it being very rare in these crates that drop in-game. Anyway, going back to topic, the economy of Team Fortress 2 is one of the biggest (if not, the biggest) growing economy day by day. Hundreds, heck, let's make them thousands of stuff are sold and bought every hour. The game is old but still holds one of the most expensive items in the Steam Trading World...The Burning Flames Team Captain. Which costs more than my life.  Trading for that one item can cost you 8000 in-game Mann Co. Keys. Which roughly translates to the cash language: $18,715.20! (this review was made at 3/11/2016. Actual price may change anytime soon.)  -Overall-  So, all in all. This game is a legacy and a curse brought to us by Lord Gabe Newell himself. The days and weeks I have used in this game has definitely brought me a new meaning in life. :^)"
one time i had a life
It's a free game witch people make friends they have fun And enjoy 10/10 ps there will be porn :)
Are you tired of your life? Are your friends gone?  WELL!  You will become a sort of Cruella De Vil -WHAT WILL WE DO WITH THESE NOOBS? -Hats...
Team Fortress 2 is a fun game that people call a 'hat simulator' but tf2 is more than that its fun gameplay cartoonish look and fun Mann VS Machine mode makes the game really enjoyable! well if you think 5 year old children screaming into thier mics just cuz they died once or bragging just cuz they got the intelligence in ctf maps enjoyable -_-
"Want fast paced action? Want hours of entertainment from the stupidest of things? Want constant updates that will break the game? Look no further than Team Fortress 2! Valve's sequel to the even more broken Team Fortress Classic delivers non stop surprises as you journey through a dessert, and a factory,and a barn in order to complete objective such as pushing and standing. You'll start your voyage as a f2p 'gibus' but once you earn your wings, you'll notice people with shiny guns and fancy hats. From then on your life will be hell trading and trading, metal and hats just to get the one unusual to make it all worth it, and you'll be trapped, unable to escape the reality that you've playec this game for nearly 700 hours. Also, if you're a sensitive, impressionable youngster make sure to disable multiplayer sprays (not as bad as gmod).   Good game i r8 8/8"
"4 years now. I`ve been playing this game for 4 YEARS now, and I can say, positively, that I will never EVER get bored of this game. Has a very nice and balanced weapon system, and very nicely done maps. Gamemodes are perfect. Writing this makes me feel wierd because I don`t know what to say. And not knowing about something you basically BREATHE every day, is kinda embarassing. So take it from me; if you have friends to play this game with, it`s totaly worth it."
It's free.
"One of the best multiplayer FPS games ever. Not Pay-to-win, amazing community, tons of features and gamemodes. Still lots of fun after years of playing."
Paid 7 cents to start trading and now I have over 1000 dollars 10/10
some guy got mad at me and sent me websites to gay porno
"Hats are the fruits of TF2. You can wear them, trade them, craft them, collect them. There's, uh, sniper hats, soldier hats, scout hats. Medic hats, heavy hats, demo hats. There's spy hats, engineer hats, pyro hats, all-class hats, painted hats, strange hats, unusual hats, uncraftable hats, limited-quantity hats, achievement hats... that- that's about it."
It's alright.
You join the game with ONE purpose...  To earn yourself some sweet hats.  So what do you do?  You pwn noobs for hats  You play with 12 year olds for hats  You pay thousands of dollars for hats  You rack up countless hours just grinding and grinding....  All of this you will do for your grand quest of owning ALL the hats.  Will you succeed? Probably.  But there's one thing I know for sure. You'll absol-  SPY SAPPIN' MAH SENTRY!
Ruined my life. 10/10
"if you like things that go boom, you will like this game. it has very good classes for any player type, and best of all? you can blow people apart!!! :D"
Character customization is like dress-up dolls for men
boobs= awesome. tf2 = awesome. tf2 = boobs
"10/10 Will take away your social life, money and relationships"
"First day you play TF2-This is such a great game, all those classes , too complex, I will never understand them and handle them. After a few days: Now I know everything about every class. Such a cool game! The Day you get the GIBUS!: Hmm is this a hat? Let`s try it on! After you realise that Tf2 is a conga and a hat simulator you want more HATS. Because, well , why not? After 1 month: You love this game so much, you have a single hat and you want more but you realise that you don`t have inventory. You buy a great hat from mann co store and then SURPISE! You get other hat gifted my mann co store because you bought something!!  A few moments after you realise that you got those hats: Hmm...I have one hat(Gibus) and these 2 hats. Illuminati triangle has 3 sides. 1+2=3 --Illuminati Confirmed!! Anyway gr8 game m8. 17.357/10-IGN-Best HAT simulator ever made. As an additional information you realise that your money disappeared. Would play that again"
"This game is so fun, and has so many different things to try. The gamemodes are all different, and each class can be played in a different way. Another thing is the community of this game, and the randomness that can happen inside the game is just amazing. Hours of fun, great game ^-^"
i got bored after the first hour
Have fun wrecking all the F2P noobs
"I remember when I first got this game, it was really good. It was fun and something new, specially compared to other First Person Shooters. But that was a some time ago. It's not as fun as it used to be. Nothing new is added and things rarely change. I'd suggest this game more than I currently am if they would ever add new weapons or game modes."
"&gt;spend 2,500 hrs on TF2 &gt;Plays on CG sever &gt;Gets airshot  1   2  too many times by demo bots &gt;ragequit"
This is a very good and awesome game.You guys should play this game.
"Have you always wanted to wear a hat, get shiny weapons, get sucked in trading, play on fun and cool servers or even get dangling robo heads on your Rocket Launcher? Then this is the game for YOU!!!!!!!!! 'The best hat simulator I have ever come across ' ~Anonymous. TF2 has always been my passion since I ever first tried it. The servers are great, we get awesome new patches and updates and the community is friendly. And in which other game does it have a trading system? NONE!!! ( I think ) And not to mention awesome HATS AND WEAPONS THAT WOULD ENLIGHTEN YOUR TF2 EXPERIANCE!!! So what are you waiting for? Get of that lousy FPS game and install TF2! Do it. DO it NOWWWWWWWWW!!! :D "
Why would you not have this game?
Do I really even need to say anything?
This game ruined my life. (In a good way.) I'm 5 hours of gameplay away from 1000 hours. That alone should prove how much I love this game.
"Sold my house to buy more hats, worth it 10/10"
It's nice.
"I actually quit playing videogames around the time I started High School, but then a few years later I was introduced to Steam and only wanted to try playing TF2 because all my close friends had it. All my friends in real life have stopped playing, but to make a long story short... I'm addicted. To be completely honest about my recommendation though, I'd change the metascore to 100/100 if I had the ability to."
This game is amazing
I'm failing in all my classes because of this game. 9/11
I made the mistake of downloading this game   Literally every time I think it's going to get boring SOMETHING happens help me I want to get off Grey Mann's wild ride  please  10/10
"Never gets boring, very well balanced weapons, fun as hell with friends and random people (given they're fairly competent), classy art style, pretty funny character one liners. Infinitely awesome, check it out."
"This game make me feel so professionaly :3 I like all the classes, mainly Sniper (like in all games).  Love idea with hats. Love idea with stranges. Love idea with killstreaks.  But lastly, updates are about some ♥♥♥♥♥.  I hate idea with skins. I hate idea with taking guns from dead players. I hate idea of making this game simullary to CS:GO  But still love it &lt;3  9/10"
Great game to for gamers who like shooter games
this game sucks their is no quickscops or grenade also people make fun of u voice
"tf2, the trading god of the steam world  this game is fun, hard and a whole lot of bullets... well let's not leave the robot's out shall we  ahhh co-op the land of gambling and robot's that are 10 freakin' feet high, don't forget the tanks. they are the worst, it takes 6 men to take it down and that isn't the hardest part of co-op. teamwork TEAMWORK IS THE HARDEST PART. you gotta be fast, you gotta do what ever it takes to win that even if you don't get the rarest drops  there is also controll point, payload, A FREAKIN' ROCKET SHIP and inteligence (just to name a few), for those who haven't got it yet GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!!

This is game.
A strange 'collecting' genre of game that involves real world money and tradeable virtual assets such as hats. Apparently there's some minigame in it where you shoot things but who gives a ♥♥♥♥ about that.
"It's fun, and it's my favorite game on Steam."

"This game is the first game on steam that i played and my most of favortite game i have ever played. Not so bloody not so bad. It's both a hat simulater game and a shooting game. All the weapons and the cosmetics are great and wonderful. With all the classes, mode,teams etc make it very interesting. I really appriciated the game and wish for it to be better in the future."
"If you are looking for hours upon hours of amazing multiplayer FPS action, this is the game for you."

Team Fortress 2 = Hat Simulator 2
Call someone a noob because he doesn't have a hat
It's fun. Got hats.

"this game is the best game that is free on steam. It has a market, cool hats, awesome weaps, and cool maps, this is game earns a 10/10 it deserves it. if you dont got this game shame on you this game is free you should have no problem in downloading it or paying money."
Awesome and very fun!
"EDIT: Well I played it again, one month after the update... they fixed some things. The level ups seem to work alright, the waiting times aren't as bad as they were initially, the competitive ticket, while expensive, is cheaper now, hackers seem to be gone for the most part... it's still worse than before, and given the choice between red and blue I'll still pick red because Valve still has some more work to do, but the game's playable now, and aside from being forced to change servers every three rounds, it's a lot of fun. So yeah, you can download it. I'm leaving the review here, though. Just so you know what happens when you release an update without testing it. Or listening to the community's feedback.  After 3 years playing this game, meeting a few awesome dudes there, buying a bunch of stuff for my main, medic... It trully pains me to write this review. The meet your match update killed this game's fun.  Basically, Valve forces everyone into either a very flawed competitive mode that also costs 12 euros (And it doesn't matter if you were the guy with most hours in the beta, you still gotta burn those 12 euros), and the new casual mode, which replaces quickplay. It's the MVM server finder, except it's even slower, it doesn't allow you to choose the map (Oh, you don't like cp_dustbowl? Too bad, buy a competitive pass!), and is overall way, way worse than the old quickplay, which wasn't perfect but was still good.  And then, at last, you're playing. And guess what, they also ruined the gameplay itself. Not because they nerfed/buffed anything too much or anything, but because of the new round system. What I loved from the game before was that you could just pick it up, and play two or three hours straight with the occassional map change as the only interruptions. If the map changed to a map you didn't like, or if the teams are incredibly unbalanced, you just jumped to another server. Now, the map changes every three rounds, after you are given your XP (more often than not you don't get it, but I digress), and if you want to change servers... hah, good luck, you're up to another fifteen minutes of waiting.  Finally, there's the issue of the hackers. There are so many more hackers now than there were before, it almost seems as if Valve just gave up on this game. Casual mode is, quite literaly, unplayable. What, tired of hackers? Buy a competitive pass!  This game was fun. It wasn't so serious (Heck, I loved going on battle medic rampages with my blutsauger from time to time), but it was the very definition of fun (remember the old motto, 'the most fun you can have online'? Such a shame). Now, they destroyed the fun part and desperatedly tried to please the hardcore competitive players with an extremely weak competitive mode, while attempting to railroad everbody into it as well. And, in the end, what we get is a game that looks like it's in beta. Except it's been out of beta for about 8 years.  But that's not the worst part. The worst part is that, they're Valve. They are never going to improve it. They don't have to care. They get more than enough money from their other games and specially, Steam itself. The tf2 economy, unlike what it may look like with all the sites dedicated to it, is next to nothing for Valve. They don't need TF2 at all. If it gets too bad, they'll just announce an AWESOME FINAL UPDATE, release some half ♥♥♥♥♥, rushed content, and then let the game go. And most likely, die.  I really wish to be wrong in that last statement. I really, trully wish I get comments on the lines of 'hah hah you idiot the game is AWESOME now', so I can come back to this review, delete it and replace it with a 2-line positive review, because I trully loved this game. But the thing is, I cannot let 'mostly positive' stand right under this game's title anymore, because right now it isn't positive. Eight years of overall positive reviews won't change, but at the very least I hope the 'recent' tab changes to 'mixed', so anyone who checks this game out for the first time knows something's up with it."
"I'm glad that Steam made this game free. At first, my friends started talking about TF2, and I had no idea what it is. Thank You for giving me and other Team Fortress 2 players a wonderful and addicting time playing this game. This is recommended to play. Don't miss out on the fun!!!"
"I dont know what to say about this game anymore. It used to be my favorite game to play. You would join the servers, win or loose the round, and move on to the next map as simple as that. Now it takes up to 15-20 minutes or more to join a game. TF2 was known for its unique differences to other games, going its own way, but they just had to copy Counter Strike. They hit the TF2 updates with skins leading all the way to this. It's pretty much CSGO but worse. I had such a good review and I didnt think i would ever say this, but TF2 is so bad now. I only play on special moded servers which are the only things they didn't change. This is such a huge dissapointment to me, that I can hardly believe what TF2 is doing. So dont waste your time geting this game if you already have Counter Strike. If you dont have either, get Counter Strike instead. R.I.P TF2."
Great game !
"Worst community ever (I am proud to say I help make it awful), but it is a great game."
"Team Fortress 2 is my favorite multiplayer game of all time. The graphics are unique while at the same time beautiful, the gameplay is fast paced but still tactical, and with a company like Valve backing it up, TF2 still remains a Tour de Force in the PC gaming community.  Plot/Story: There is no single player campaign, but if you look closely you begin to see patterns. An ongoing comic strip on Valve's website reveals that the two sides, Blu and Red, are in actuality super companies dominating the 1940s. The lovable cast of characters is in actuality a group of mercenaries hired by the two rival companies.  Special effects/Graphics: This game is absolutely stunning. It has a very cartoony feel, but at the same time can result in amazing amounts of gore. There is an undercurrent of fun to the animations, with several hilarious taunts to go with each character.  Characters: Brilliant. There are nine playable characters: The Scout, a stereotypical American small town boy in love with baseball, The Soldier, a xenophrenic psychopath running around with a rocket launcher, The Pyro, no explanation needed, the Demoman, a drunk Scotsman who loves explosions, the Heavy, a minigun toting Russian with a Sandvich, the Engineer, who builds sentry guns and teleporters, the Sniper, again no explanation needed, the Medic, who can 'Ubercharge' a teammate, making them temporarily immortal, and The Spy, a professional Frenchman who is more for cleaner ways of killing.  Closing thoughts: Everything about TF2 is perfect. Also, Valve puts out almost daily updates, constantly addressing concerns and complaints from the community. Also, unlockable, upgradable weapons are available. It becomes so that no one's loadout is exactly the same, and more and more weapons are constantly added to the mix.  There are also hats, which are the ultimate status symbol in the game.  10/10."
"Team Fortress 2... In a word? Amazing. This game has so many unique aspects to it such as crafting, weapon finding, and multiplayer glory. Conquer territory in hundreds of different ways! Whether it be capturing a flag, taking controll points, or even pushing a payload equipted with a bomb! Different loadouts mean more possible combinations to rule everyone! This game is by far one of my favorite games ever made. On a scale of 1-10 I have made some of my opinions.  Creativity: 9 Variability: 10 Addictivity: 8 My Love: 11  Have fun with your newly download TF2! :) "
Addictive
"I've almost played this game for 2000 hours, do you think i think it's good?"
★★★★☆  Great game. Still updated after so many years ! But it can be very repetitive and messy sometimes.
the game is not fun anymore the whole ranked system is just thrown in there and now it is just try hards you cant have a good time
"I've spent too much time, and spent too much money on this game.  Too addictive."
This game is so awesome!
"Team Fortress 2 has allot to offer, and delivers on it's expectations for it's fans.  About two years ago I started playing this game out of pure curiousity, and found myself in admiration of what the core feature of this game was. I kept playing it and finding more items to the point that I need to stop being f2p. The item system in this game is truly fascinating, and is worth holding a conversation about. I found myself playing this game allot and over the past two years I've punched in over 900 hours on it (and I'm still really bad). I find the system of weapons and cosmetics was a truly unique one. The way people make fun of cosmetics is a rather stupid decision. The cosmetics, name tags, weapons, etc. Make you able to stand out from everyone else. I find myself playing this game quite often, and loving it even more every time. I love the other forms of intertainment that Valve (The Producers) update quite often (The Web-Comic, SFM Series, Etc.). I feel as if just talking about this game isn't doing it any justice. Go and play it and see for yourself if you enjoy it.   I give this game a solid 8.6/10.0 For:  It's unique take on a genre of gaming that has otherwise become dull. An active community that is only growing and becoming for friendly torwards eachother. An item system that allows you and your class loadout to stand out. A truly fun experience that keeps you coming back for more.  Thanks for reading this it took me a long time to think of what to say about it but just sitting behind a monitor reading about it isn't doing it any justice (as I stated before.). Go and pla y it and message me what you my. My Name is Blue~ Signing off. Bye!"
"recent updates ruined the game. this seems to happen to so many games these days, didnt expect it with tf2. They tried to make it like cs go. RIP"
This... is the absolute best game. Download it now.
It's like pokemon but without pikachu
"The fact that this game has 600,000 reccomendations should warrant downloading it, great game and it's free"
""
This game is making me miss school and getting bad marks. 10/10
I can dance if I want to.
The most amazing + entertaining FTP game ever
this game should be removed
Fun and exciting to play
Epic. Andrenaline Racing. Fast Paced. Awesome Graphics. Best game I've seen so far.
Some people don't like this game...  I hate them...  GRRR......
"a classic,love it :)"
I wasted an important part of my life on this game. I did it for a reason.
They gone and ♥♥♥♥ed up
"A must play game for every Steam user!  Very balanced and fun gameplay, it can be very addicting.  I would recommend this to people new to FPS's."
"Greatest Game i ve ever played!! i wanted this game for 5 months and i got it finally (thank God)!, no body cares if you are F2P ( im F2P) show your skill and show who is the daddy in the house!"
Hello: D I recommend you download the game I really enjoy playing terrific financed This game is very good.  תרגום לעברית : אני מאוד אוהב את המשחק ואני ממליץ לכם  לשחק בו ומי שישחק בו אני אומר שהוא לא יתחרט
This game...is amazing. The diversity of the classes just makes gameplay just that much more exciting. Each class has so many different loadouts that each one has its own upgrades and downgrades.
I play this game for almost 4 years but now I unistaled it. Why? Because of meet the match upade. Team Fortress was better before they change it cs go. I hate matchmaking and idea to had ranks in ♥♥♥♥ing casual games. I won like 3 games in matchmaking and I earn 0 exp cuz one other team leaved game at end. Who in valve thinked thats good idea... At the end if u want another cs go instal this game.
One of the best games ive ever played ... love it .... good job valve keep up the good work.
this sucks on ice
"It´s free its fun and is addictive, what more do you need for installing and then playing it so go to the steam store istall the game and i promise you great times lots of friends and something to do when you are bored when you had enough of xbox or playstation.  I give yhis game a 9 out of 10 it has innovating modes new and strange-interesting weapons and, (of course) HATS!!! a lot of godamn hats it is a FPS so it makes it funny because its not COD or HALO so you can variate. I really REALLY recomend it to you EXCELSIOR!!!!!"
One of the best games i've played
"My experiences with TF2 vary, depending on which server I’m thrust into. Interpret what you will from what I say, but what happens to players here usually amount to the following pros and cons (told from my accounts of what happened). PROS: 1. I was playing Spy in Well (CTF), and my team was getting annoyed with me just stealthily slinking in and relaying info to them. They wanted me to actually grab the intel and run like a bat out of hell. Well, during the last dregs of the evening, I was scoping out the enemy territory, watching this Pyro run around, watching the corners. One of my teammates says, “Kitty! You’re right there! Grab the intel!” I nervously reply, “But there’s a Pyro. Pyros are notoriously bad for a cloaked Spy’s health! Don’t you like what I’m telling you already? While this was going on, the Pyro somehow manages to notice me, and trudges over. But instead of killing me he nudges me as I’m standing there, like he wants me to decloak. I do so.  “Um… hi?”  The Pyro opens up the Rock Paper Scissors taunt, mumbling expectantly. I mentally shrug, and play along. The Pyro loses with Scissors, and explodes in a shower of blood and guts. Not believing my luck, I run to grab the intel, get it, and hitch myself all the way back to our base without any trouble from the enemy team.  “Like that?”  “Yeah. Grab the intel like that.” I wasn’t bothered by that guy again for the rest of the round. 2. I was playing Heavy in Mountain Lab, and one of my buddies decides to be my Pocket Medic. We were told of the enemy setting up a huge sentry nest right at the final point, so we decide to try to take it out. The nest consisted of 2 level 3 sentries (one wrangled during the fight), 2 level 3 dispensers, 3 Engineers, and a PyBro. The Medic and I, through the use of his Vaccinator goodness and my Brass Beast skills, we manage to kill the 2 engineers, the PyBro, the 2 dispensers, one of the level 3 sentries, and manage to get the wrangled one down to a trickle of health before I realize that my Pocket Medic died, and I was dying myself. I was promptly killed by the sentry soon after.  “That was a very good try. Thanks for the Vaccinator buffs!” (Always thank the Medics. They feel good about themselves, and are more willing to help you later.)  One of the Engineers I killed comments, “That was indeed a very good try.”  In that round, I gained 2 Steam Friends, and a newfound love for the Brass Beast.  3. Lastly, I was using my Phlog Pyro in Turbine (CTF). One of my buddies says, “Hey. Can I join you?” “Sure! Bring your Kritzkrieg Medic so we can wipe the floor with the enemy team!”  My buddy hops on, and we get started on camping at the enemy’s doors.  5 minutes, 6 Pyro Achievements, 4 dominations, and 32 kills later, some Black Box Soldier sneaks up on us and explodes my buddy and I into bits.  We won 3 seconds later.  The Phlogstinator isn’t broken. It’s awesome!  CONS:  1. There is a distinct difference between those who buy their weapons and cosmetics, and those that do not. The latter are slaughtered mercilessly by the former, and are considered the scum of the game. Mountain lab is especially a great area for Free 2 Play (F2P) players to be sniped off and dominated constantly. 2. People will be snide, sarcastic, racist, homophobic, and uncompromising in this game. People were complaining about this one Sniper who was accused of hacking, and was headshotting a lot of the team. I tried to stick up for the guy, citing COD as a way for Snipers to hone their skills before playing TF2. I was promptly informed that my defense of the Sniper was “the most Autistic speech I had ever heard”, and was insulted as such for the rest of the round.  During another round, one of the people on my team was using his microphone to play recordings of a Hitler speech and a racist/homophobic song he made himself. Others joined in, stating that they were voting for The Donald (he lost his last name in a bad real estate gamble, so I refuse to use it for anything else), and the entire hullabaloo was grating into my nerves. I exploded on the guy, and I was trolled incessantly until I left the server. 3. A LOT of people play TF2. This can result in high ping rates and server lag. Server lag is the most common cause of death in TF2. For instance, I was playing Spy in a round of Crossover (CTF), and I found this Heavy near the intel, couched with his back so deliciously presented to me. So, assuming that I could get the jump on him, I decloaked and prepared to backstab. Then the screen froze for about 4 seconds while the server lagged and the Heavy could punch me to death while I stood there.  Those are my accounts of what good and bad parts there are in playing TF2. Again, interpret what you will."
Team Fortress 2 is a great game if you love first person shooters and the fact that you can trade with other users make it a unique game. I recommend this game since its awesome :3
"I like this game, If you don't know why then get out of your cave"
"Played this for a long time. It's a great game, but it was ruined a bit because of the hats,"

"I have spent 128 days playing this game and my lust for hats is still not satisfied. Praise our lord and savior Gaben and the demigod Robin Walker for this gift. If I had to pick one thing about this game that I didn't like it would be the lack of hats. Seriously, more hats."
GET IT OKAY  NO QUESTIONS  JUST GET IT
"If you have a social life, please dont play this game."
"Great game. Great teamwork aspect, great class-based system, great everything. It's like a great thing with great things stuck to it in Greatborough in the county of Greatshire. Great."

"Was once my all time favorite online shooter, which led to me trying out more games in the genre. However, TF2 is not the same game it was back then marred by subpar updates that make the game not as enjoyable as it once was to me. The best years of TF2 were 2007-2012 and it went downhill gradually from there."
Been playing this game on and off since 2007 and it is still fun as hell. That's sayin' somethin'. MvM is a huge plus. Gameplay is stellar and playing different classes keep the game fresh.  10/10
"An extremely casual shooter full of broken mechanics and balancing, and whose dev team gives 0 ♥♥♥♥♥ about anything beyond income.   During the day it's a marketplace for kids to trade pixels for arbitrary ingame currency."
Best Hat SImulator 2007-2014 now with more bread than ever sexy as ♥♥♥♥
"After spending a large amount of time (at least, compared to the amount of time i've had Steam) i've spent on this game, i have to say that this game is one of the better games on here. Sure, there is the occasional idiot on a random server, but for the most part, the community is very nice (when they aren't blowing you up with rockets or gibbing you with a minigun). Anyways, this game is a good one, and, even if you don't spend money on it, you'll still have an amazing time on it."
"Awesome game,I recommend it to everyone!"
"I don't have many hours in tf2 but it seems like a good game, it is filled with hats"
"'ucking Incredible' - Me, 2014"
Fantasitic first person shooter that will keep you laughing and playing for hours!
"Recent update has broken the game imo. absolutly terrible as it stands. This game used to be something I could always fall back on, now it has been uninstalled. GJ valve."
This is the game you would want to play if you want to spend a lot of money. 10/10
"Team Fortress 2 is one of the upmost addictive games I have played, the gameplay is very interesting and entertaining and it's one of them types of games which actually requires team work to win. The most exciting parts of the game from my prespective is the unboxing and getting them awesome moments in a match. I honestly advise getting this game, atleast try it as it is free to play!"
"Team Fortress 2 is a good game, mate. It's challenging, fun as heck, and I guarantee you'll find a new love of headwear, because as long as there's two people left on the planet, someone is gonna want someone's hat."
started playing it last year eversince then its like most of my free time now
"best game for shooting, like 8 years :)"
This game is the most fun you'll ever have. you can get into  1. Pubs where you have fun 2. Competitive where you show your skills 3. trading where you make tons of money and get really cool stuff
Shooty Shooty bang gang 2 is alright. I guess
"Valve took over 4500 hours of my life to this game, and I don't want them back &lt;3"
Best Game Ever. It Has hats and overpriced ♥♥♥♥ and yeah!!!!
"this game is like sextime, you like it more and more :yay:"
"Fun, addicting, exciting, interesting and fabulous game !!"
hat
"yea i recommend this game for everyone. not because i hope that gabe newell will give me free ♥♥♥♥. so fun game, go and play. become a hat ♥♥♥♥♥ today."
This game is this bestest you have holy trucks full of rockets and its op like WOAAH mayn its cool an its like the best competivite e-sports out there cause u can do roll-outs an frag and cool kid stuff get this gayme if ur cool! dont be a fool
Definitely one of the most fun FPS games you can find. Nine unuque and funny classes and a good amount of customization makes this game a must-play for fans of the genre! The only con that I can think for this game is that there are a few certain loadouts that just overpower everything else and some of the cosmetic options can cost a lot of money. But if you can get past those few annoyances (and it should be easy to do so) this can be an incredibly fun game!
"10/10, one of the best games i've ever played. Large variety of playstyles to choose from, hundreds of hats/miscs to wear and show off to your friends, generally a great combat-based-hat-simulator! If there was any room for improvement, I would personally suggest adding more weapons instead of just retextures. That aside, this is a great Free-to-play FPS. PLAY EET NAO!!!"
"This is the kind of game that you come home to, open your pc and play for hours"
  its cool
"This game has provided me hours of fun. I Like the fact that you can get almost anything from the store on a lower price from the Steam Community market. The market is also a very good thing. I Don't really have any types of problems with F2P's, They're just playing. You could actually get up your lazy ♥♥♥ and teach them to play instead of mocking them and calling them names. Make TF2 A better game and help everyone have fun. I Was a complete noob back in the day. Now i think of myself as an average player. Overall Really good game."
"Meet your match update completely ruined the game for me, the new match making takes longer than before, matches feel more one sided and many of the games ive played have been with unbalanced teams, the game didnt need this update and it only made TF2 worse if you're a new player go right ahead and play but as for me and some of the older players this update is trash and this is coming from a person who played TF2 casually"
Worst update any game has ever gotten. Hope valve fixes it.
"Making a good first person shooter is not easy. On one end of the spectrum, you have awesome games like Operation Flashpoint and ArmA II, which deliver the gritty realism of combat in every sense of the word, and on the other end, you have flamboyant, utterly unrealistic and silly arcades for teenagers and senior citizens like Call of Duty. In between, a handful of good games, like Urban Terror and family. But decent, fun, engaging shooters are rare.  Team Fortress 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer shooter developed by Valve Corporation, the guys behind Steam, and the game is indeed available through their Steam service. Runs on Windows and Linux. The requirements are fair, but the premise is even fairer: A game that does not try to be an in-your-face would-be realistic enactment on combat; instead, it is meant to be fun.  Game in depth  At a first glance, you might be a little confused, because the game really offers a lot. In Team Fortress, you play as a member of either the blue or red team. So far so good. Regardless of which side you choose, you can select one of the nine unique player classes, specializing in offensive, defensive and support roles. As you may have already figured out, offensive characters are lighter and faster, the defensive ones are slower and more heavily armed, and the support cast is comprised of your less-popular combat types.  In the offense role, you can be either the Scout, Soldier or Pyro. When playing defense, you can choose the Demoman, Heavy or Engineer. Medics, Snipers and Spies play your support roles. Now, here's the nice thing. Each one of these has its own strong points and weaknesses. Each demands that you utilize a different play style, different tactics and approach to combat. And when you combine a handful of players into a team, you get strategy.  Charging an objective with five Heavies wielding miniguns is not that interesting. But if you can have Engineers building defense machine gun tripods or teleporters, Medics healing your units, Snipers taking headshots from afar, and scouts operating behind enemy lines, it all becomes so much more engaging. There's no single formula to victory, the gameplay is far from linear, and different situations require some mind sweat.  That's not all  Then, you have your awards, special moves, as I like to call them, and backpack items. As you play various missions, you will slowly accumulate items of worth found thrown about map levels or you will unlock them after performing an incredible stunt or a killing spree record. These will go into your backpack, and you will be able to use them now and then in critical situations. Think of them as magical powers, if you will.  Special moves can be considered secondary actions of your unique weapons. For example, Pyro can use his flame thrower in the secondary mode to deflect enemy fire back at them. The Heavy can move with the minigun rotating and ready to fire, without wasting time to spin it up for the first round. Medics can ubercharge your health if they remain in close proximity to you for a certain period of time. Spies also have their backstab move that will kill an opponent with a single blow.  All of the units have several weapons. You can fight bare-handed, with a short-range weapon like a pistol and a long-range, main unit. Engineers can assemble and destroy a variety of structures. Spies can sap life energy from nearby enemy troops. Then, when you thought it's all there, you can also trade your items and buy stuff online for real money. Plus, the game tracks your record and gives you beautiful statistics. And so it goes, getting all the more colorful and compelling.  Map levels are fairly standard, with a handful of nice exceptions. Capture the Flag, Control Point and King of the Hill are the usual share of any multiplayer shooter. Then you also get the crazy Payload mission, where your A-bomb shaped rail wagon travels down a route only with your soldiers in proximity to it, and goes back if the enemy soldiers are swarming around it. Usually, one team pushes the wagon and the other tries to stop it from reaching its destination. Sometimes, you get both teams pushing at the same time. A perfect example of cooperative work that require thinking and wise tactics and, above all, teamplay. In the Medieval mode, all soldiers are armed with clubs and swords, except Snipers who wield the bow and arrow. Awesome.  Humor  The best part about this game is not its free price tag, its unique missions or characters, not even the variety of maps. It's humor. Team Fortress 2 does not take itself seriously. Nor should you. The game is all about being fun, without any silly pretentious agenda. And this is where most titles fail. By trying to emulate reality, they become weird, bloated graphics guzzlers that sacrifice quality for haze and glare effects.  In contrast, Team Fortress comes with almost cartoonish graphics. No, scratch that. WITH cartoonish graphics. The characters look like a blend of Evil Genius super villain henchmen, including the accents and stereotypes. Austin Powers mode of thinking is evident everywhere, including the 60s-like trumpet tone cues when you die, the slow-motion camera rotations, the silly soldier salutes and gestures. It' all very trippy.  Still more fun  When you play Team Fortress 2, you put anxiety aside and focus on pure joy of blasting colors across your pixilated screen and you revel in the little nonsense details that add so much spice and fun to the gameplay. All the while you find the levels to be well designed and balanced. The cartoon styling also lets the developers have total freedom with how they design things, because there are no limits to how things ought to look. Tomorrow, they might choose to create futuristic space mission levels, and the game settings would naturally blend.  So far, I have played the game only a handful of hours, but I am extremely pleased. Team Fortress does not get boring. Although you may play the same mission types over and over, you can rotate your class, so in theory, every game can be replayed in nine different ways. Really addictive and fun.  Conclusion  Team Fortress 2 is one of the more pleasant surprises in the gaming world in the recent months. It's not a new title, but its free availability is. The game comes with a beautiful visual display of colors and shapes without stressing your box too much, decent physics, superb humor, excellent side action that adds life to you game, unique action, and tons of other perks. Best of all, it runs natively on Linux.  This game is a sure keeper. And if you play it through Steam, then your character history and achievements are preserved across your multiple machines and operating systems. So I warmly recommend you download and install Team Fortress and have a merry go. You will be surprised. Moreover, I guarantee your games will be accompanied with a broad, quirky smile on your face."
"If it ain't broke don't fix it.  It's a simple addage. TF2 was not, in the matchmaking sense, broken. Now it is. Bravo, Valve."
"This update has completely killed the chance for anyone to play normal TF2. I had hopes that the competitive match making update would be the first in a series of TF2 improvements, but now I see it is the last nail in the coffin. Used to be able to join a random server, have fun, and leave when I pleased. Now you wait in a search que for ten minutes or longer, for a completely random map. Now Valve thinks it's a good idea to hold a contest to see which class gets new weapons? Every class needs new weapons! Not new taunts, not new cosmetics, and certainly not a ticket that you need to pay for to play true competitive mode! Now if you will excuse me, I am off to go buy Overwatch so I can play a real FPS game that has developers who actually work, and listen to the community."
"valve, i think you put the wrong tube into your head. i am sorry to say that your months of work on this update are wasted time. i realise my you just ruind the saterday of thousends players. all i recommend is to put everything back to what it was; a good game."
"This was my favorite game for a long time, but after the latest update (7-7-16) i wasn't even able to play a game without the game crashing from glitches and lag, or i couldnt even get onto a server at all, this game was great, now it cant even be played. Unless you are looking for a lag simulator."
This game was fun. Until valve took a massive steaming ♥♥♥♥ on it by replacing 'Quickplay' mode into 'Casual' mode. It now takes 10-30 mins to actually join a ♥♥♥♥ing game... R.I.P TF2 (2007 - 2016)
"So, It comes to this, eh Valve? We turn TF2 into CS:Overwatch;Fortress Edition? Well, let it be said that this is not what the playerbase wanted when we downloaded this game. I let the new cases for cosmetics and missions and weapon skins slide, but this is too far. If i wanted matchmaking, i'd play CS:G0. If i wanted 'an upgraded team experience,' I'd go to League. This is not what i wanted. Fix This. I submit this review, not because i want to, but because it needs to be said. You obviously don't know why people play TF2 if you've gone and done this.  We don't play for seriousness. or points, or even teamwork. I want to be able to come home and relax to some simple, non-realistic, cartoonish violence. Simple is no longer part of the equation, and as a result, TF2 just isn't fun anymore. If i want to play a quick match, i have to go to the community servers where every third map i have to download. Fix this. I hope that someone in that office complex understands just how collosally you've cocked this one up. Fix this."
"Tf2 used to be my favorite game, 9 playable classes, tons of weapons and playstyles that come with each one, how easy it was join a game, and best of all it's a casual game. Tf2 had always been fun for me because it was so casual and it didn't matter if you did bad in a round or your score was really low, because no one really cared, and there was no penalty for doing bad. The most recent update Meet Your Match completely destroyed that. First of all the casual games take seriously at least 5 minutes to join, and sometimes even more up to 20 minutes, also you're not allowed to choose your map. In casual games there's also now a level system, which I get for competative but why in casual mode, it ruins the casual, laid back gameplay and forces people to care about their score and play well to level up. It also punishes you for leaving a game in other words they punish you for not playing through a 20 minute match and having things to do. Without the casual feel in tf2 it's just like a Call Of Duty with bad graphics. So good job valve, you've made a silly casual game into a breeding ground for tryhards."
Don't know what the big fuss is about this game but personally I don't like it. Just didn't have fun playing it at all. Sorry
Best f2p game.
its ok i guess. It has hats.What more could you ask for.    9/10 Not enough shrek.
"Sold my real life for some fancy hats - worth it!  Would recommend for friends,family and schoolmates."
"i dont know where to start here, do you know what this is? do you even know what yoyr looking at? your looking at a top of the line hat simulator thats incredibly fun. its free, its not p2p, its easy to get good at. also i killed a heavy with a cardboard tube, so ya theres that. PLAY THE GAME!!"
"Don't make me talk about this game that stole my life money and 1,000 hours of my life. This game has its own economy I mean theres 11 and 12 year olds babblin' like 40 yr old men over gun laws, why do i play the game oh it isn't because Im good at a class its because its the best dressing game since Surfing Diva. What about Man vs Machine you ask? its basically Gabe Newells impression of Iron Man 2. R.I.P Trident' Wallet Jan 4 2013-June 19 2014"
This game is a amazing fps hat simulator. If you like animated fps this is the one to get.
"This game literally took all my money. Was it worth it? Yeah for the memories but once you get your first hat, misc, or strange you're hooked. BE WARNED. 11/10 would play again but i need to buy food."
pretty good game ive only played it a tiny bit but i think its really good
Best ever would give this one to anyone
"To begin I would like to say that TF2 is a F2P game and I would recommend it to anybody. The following is a Shrek Is Love Shrek Is Life parody that is CHILD FRIENDLY. I was only 13 years old. I loved TF2 so much. I had put countless ammounts of money onto steam to get al the TF2 miscs. Every night I pray to the scout, soldier, engineer, medic, sniper, spy, heavy and demos that I would get a good trade in the morning. My parents hear me and say I have an addiction. I knew he was jeleous of my pro skills at TF2 so I said he should leave me alone. My parents ban me and send me to sleep. I know I will never gte my Level Three Chin anymore now. I feel a warmth approaching me in my bed. Its a fat engineer that says 'i see you found my teleporter enterance'. I tell the fat engineer that I am ready. He gets out a chair and sits down drinking beer. He offers me one now but I say no. I feel my eyes tearing at his fat face. But I know that one day I want to be like him.   So thats my parody of Shrek Is Love Shrek Is Life. Please go check out the video afterwards if you already havn't to understand this fully. WARNING THHIS VIDOE ON YOUTUBE WILL CONTAIN RUDE WORDS AND SCENES! So in the end I think of TF2 as a fantastic game!"
"Played 10ish hours found $400 hat, ♥♥♥♥ game. 10/10"
"Team Fortress 2 is a solidly constructed online FPS experience. It's fully playable right when you open the game, with no deceitful tricks to empty your wallet. It also uses the Source Engine, so your game will probably run pretty smoothly, even if you have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC. TF2 offers 9 distinctly different classes to choose from, and hundreds of customizable loadouts available, so you are bound to find your own playing style. The community is great, and definitely not as hostile as in some other games (ahem, DOTA). In addition, there's a large sense of collecting to do in the game, with hats and unique weapons to trade for. If you ever become bored with your regular pubs for some reason, you can always get into competitive play, which will surely keep you interested. All in all, Team Fortress 2 is a fantastic title that players are bound to enjoy."
"I love this game because of two classes 1. Spy: all because you can get over like 89 kill with the damn backstab , i love that backstab , instakill! How To Get over 89 backstabs get to the base by disquising then find a high spot you can stalk and enemy from , follow them then get close enough to backstab them then redisquise and do the same thing 2. Engineer: If you go on an idle/trade server then build a little base out of bounds by 'Wrangling a sentury gun lvl 3 and rocketing yourself out of bounds' then build your base destroy the other sentury build a teleporter exit and entrance anxd a sentury and dispenser then make sure the sentury can shoot idle people and watch those kills and items go up"
Best Muilti player game ever.
"Dota 2 is better then this garbage and that says a lot when all I see in Dota 2 is a black and blurry screen. At least farming simulator is more action packed then this. I would rather spend my time playing Modern Warfare 3 aka 420QU1CKSC0P3 Bl4Z3 IT simulator. But hey, if you always dreamed of having a multitude of hats like I did when I was a wee little boy, then this is the game for you!"
Very good game. Love the uber charge and being invinsible! 
1/10 this game sucks the godmode command broke my game so I cant do anything
"Right up there with big hit titles such as, Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing, Sonic The Hedgehog 2006, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, TF2 is the most intelligently designed, well thought out, absolute work of art to...PFFTF HAHHAHAHAHAHA I CANT! I CANT!"
This is a game. It's cool. You shoot people. If you have Steam you should have this. If you're reading this you have Steam. Have this game.
Nice game
"fun game that has meny maps,weps and a lot of hats one of my favorite games"
This game is just great! You make so many friends and its an easy game to jump into and grab a hold of. It has a vast community of very nice players and is just a great game. :3
This is the best war-themed hat simulator. Nuf said.
"One of the best games i have ever played balanced gameplay, fun weapons and hats.... lots of hats"
"You will play this religiously, and at time will make friends, my guideline? Don't be generous, ♥♥♥♥ everyone around you and strive to the top, and most importantly, no matter how many people you have to backstab, your unusual is worth it."
I need hats.
TF2 is over. Forced matches are in. RIP quickplay servers
"new account, time to waste my money again on this one 10/10 would go broke again"
it's the best computer game of all time that i've played!
  This is a serious review. I'm an experienced Team Fortress 2 player. 
I think is best steam game 
"Super solid mechanics, fun and diverse gameplay. I don't know why I'm writing this because literally everyone on steam has TF2 in their library.  That's okay because I'm basically the best demoman in the game except for the other ones so I have some authority on the matter."
"Team Fortress 2 is one of the highest rated games on Steam, and with good reason. With 8 different gamemodes, hundreds of weapons, 9 classes that emphasize players roles and teamwork, and hundreds of thousands of players, this first-person shooter has a lot of diversity, depending on what you're in the mood, whether it be Capture the Flag, surviving wave after wave of bots, pushing a bomb towards the enenmy base, or just having a good time with the guys you're supposed to be shooting at, TF2 has something for just about everyone. TF2 also has regular updates, with new weapons, hats (yes, hats), and occasionally even new gamemodes. it's also 100% free-to-play. Of course, there are many, many microtransactions, but these are completely unnecessary for playing the game, unless you feel that you absolutely need to have that new weapon or hat that just came out. Even then, all weapons can be randomly found or crafted in-game, and the hats have no effect on actual gameplay. All in all, this game is really fun, and it's a must-have amongst first-person shooters."
"I was like you once, you know, just browsing the steam store, getting all the valve games. Then I got this one... I was F2P for a long time. Until one morning I decided to buy like, one weapon to get me premium. I'd seen scrap banking videos on YouTube, so I wanted to buy a huntsman and build it up to a strange killstreak. Then, fate looked down on me and decided I didn't need a life. I went on the man co store, planning to buy the huntsman and spend the rest of the fund card on games. Then, I saw the hats. Line by line, those beauties, shining and glittering in the darkness of my bedroom. I bought one. Then my life chsnged forever. Trading, banking, buying, uncrating and just being addicted to these hats...  Now it's to late for me. I got a team captain, and realised I'd exceeded my target. But I wanted to spend more money on the store... Pour money into valve... Buy hats. Now I feel hats whispering my name, I feel their prescience. I see them on those I love... I see them in my food. I can feel Gabe Newell in my soul, pressuring me to buy more hats... I can't take it anymore. As I type this, I feel a key in my mouth. Fake hats on my head, professional killstreaks burning my eyes... Help me.  I love tf2, deeply recommend this game to anyone, be it a COD player or just an idiot."
The game that offers everyone endless hours of fun and hat trading. Team Fortress 2 has it's unique world full of jokes and tauns. A whole universe full of hats awaits those who enter it. It's very addicting and constantly updated. It's one of those games that requires playing as a team. And that's what makes it perfect. I still can't believe that it's free. Thanks VALVe.     10/10 
I've played this game far too much.
I think that a free shooter game with like 8 classes is great. i reccomend 9/10.
'Ten' - JonTron 2014
Best thing to do stuff in
"Game is good but the community is absolute cancer. I don't recommend it unless you're undergoing chemo. League of Legends has a less toxic community if you could believe that. That's how bad it's gotten. A single player campaign mode would be alright as a later update, but I doubt that would ever happen."
"It all started going downhill for me during Scream Fortress when I realized I was playing Scream Fortress 2015 for the second time. A few years ago I wuld've been fine with that because I was young and dumb, but now I'm just disgusted at how little effort they put into this game. I'm sorry, but until TF2 gets better, it's staying uninstalled and no longer in my favorites. RIP TF2 2007-2016 'Almost made it to a golden ten years'  Also I'm giving it 'The 'Dead Game' Award' in the 'We Didn't Think of Everything' category."
This helped me count 1-100 by joining any server and counting the amount of kids screaming. 100/100 would count again

"An excellent game! Due to the huge content and ever expanding items and updates TF2 almost never gets old! It's an excellent blend of fps and action, but it's also cartoonishly funny. However, be warned! TF2 has gone free to play, and all you new guys may encounter some mean p2p (paid to play) bullies. Just brush them off and have fun! TF2 is a great game, and it's free, so get it! "
you can fap to the free porn sprays... without any virus... i r r8 dis 69/10
if you what a game where you shoot everwon in the face this is the game with 9 class you will have a fun time.
Game has memes....We all need dank memes from others....And also Medics Cause who cant go wrong with medic mains?
"Really feels like they've ruined the game with the latest update. Who wants to spend 30 minutes waiting to join a game? I tried buying the $10 DLC to see if that would help, but it just made things worse. Maybe it's a good thing, now I'll have more time for hiking or something."
"Ok, after almost 300 hours on this game, the new update has come, it is time for Cat's (pretty crappy) review!  So, Team fortress 2 is a multiplayer shooter game in cartoon style. Choose between 9 classes that has it's own skills and playstyles. has alot of maps, weapons and tons, tons of, yep you guessed it right, HATS!!! That is the special thing of tf2. You can customize your own class with cosmetics, from cool fedora hats to... wait, A CRAPPY SHOE!? There is also taunts so your class can do some things. like headbutt someone etc. Good variety of gamemodes like Co-op etc. So, tf2 contents are pretty good. Nothing bad.   ( i am amazed of you have read so far)  Now let's take a look in community. Tf2 has a steam workshop, which means that anyone (including you) can make stuff for tf2. Weapons, hats, taunts and more. So then Valve can take a look in your creation, and see if it is suitable for tf2. There is alot of community servers. And custom gamemode. Go check it out by yourself. However, there can be some really bad players like hackers, scammers, and G.A.O.Y.H.O.I.C players (Gimme All Of Your hats Or I Cry players) . but if you see those players you can just leave. but wait. The new update has come.  So, the new update called meet your match (or meat vs Match) is a update that includes many things. I will not go through everything but i will include those most important things. Now tf2 has get a competitive and a casual, or with other words, they have copied CS:GO. now it does'nt seem that bad, i mean i really like the idea. But the only thing is, the wait time. You go to casual, wait 7 weeks just to get into a match that is unbalanced, hackers, and half of your team has just leaved. Yeah i know right, but at least you can tell those Sponge bob jokes. 2000 years later, 2 hours later later etc. Very funny :D Sure you can join community servers but ads everytime you die, admin abuse, and some can be very crappy community, but worst of all, cod kids, my only weakness. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!  PROS - Good content with cosmetics etc - Good community (well sometimes) - Have variety playstyles so you can play a class with different styles - Alot of custom things like gamemode, mods etc.  - Have Cat cosmetics ;)  CONS - After new update, long wait time for casual and competitive. So basically impossible to play casual and competitive. - You can play community servers, but risk is for admin abuse etc. - Random crits, which can cause you to ragequit and become super saiyan :(  Well so as you can see, the only thing that is bad is the new update. Long wait time is the only bad thing now but hope it will be fixed. PRAY FOR GABEN!!! So as you can see i voted no to this game, but it does'nt mean it is bad and i dont like it. The only thing is that i dont really like the new update. It is the new update that is bad, not the game. Just so you know. But it can be fixed.   So i give it a 7/10. Wait time is too long.  My last words: Spy sappin' my sentry! Thx and have a good day!"
is hawt
i ♥♥♥♥ing hate this game  it ruined my life  900000/10
tf2 is a really good game. the update made it worse becase of all the cheaters in competitive.it should go back in the old updates. meet your match i think is so bad i go play other game then tf2. And i love tf2 its was the best fps there is. valve please fix tf2 meat your match.Now do i recommend this game well no. becase of the new update i really dislike the how valve did it. but over all tf2 is one of my favoret computer game there is. Just valve fix the update please!!!!
This game is dead
"I loved this game when I started playing it (which wasn't long ago) because it was the kind of multiplayer game I was looking for. But ever since this update happened, it's more of a pain in the ♥♥♥ than anything. I have to wait forever for a game to even connect casually anymore, and I'm tired of waiting. I haven't been able to play a single casual game since the update. I'm tired of it. This game was ruined."
"This has to be my most played game ever, why? The infinite amount of gamemodes and custom maps, which on top of that will automatically download when you join a server with a custom mod or map making it extremely easy to access the so called 'community' maps and gamemodes. The game is kind of complex but can be simple once you know what youre doing its easy to get love in with and suddenly without noticing, youve used 4000 hours... 9 classes defines the infinite choices for game play styles this games comes with, when im bored of one class i can just switch to another class easy as that. But the best part is ITS FREE! :D So why not give it a try!!! "
"Throughout history, men have worn hats as a way of showing how much better they are than other men. “I buy hats,” a behatted man seems to say. “I am better than you.”"
sold my burning team captain for a slice of bread 10/10
"This game, while old and outdated, is a classic to test the ages. From the Epic Gun Mettle to the mixed bag of Meet Your Match, the game is fun, balanced and most of all, FREE! I can't stress this enough, You don't have to spend a dime on the game and still have a boatload of fun. Stop what your doing and play this game."

"The new update destroyed everything that fun in TF2.  Too long time to play, Good maps deleted and almost everything cost money! The only way that you can really play is on the community servers.  TF2 is sucks now."
"Not your average shooter, but thats what makes it awsome."
"BACK IN THE OLDEN DAYS, THIS GAME WAS THE PRIME EXAMPLE OF EXCELLENT GAMEPLAY FLUENCY AND WONDERFUL, DYNAMIC EXPERIENCES. BUT VALVE HAD TO ♥♥♥♥ IT UP BY ADDING HATS. ♥♥♥♥ NO WHY."
The only game where 120fps can feel like 20.
"Takes up way too much time, overly addictive. 14/10"
"Terrible devs, every update large or small makes the game completly disfunctional, for a company with so much wealth you'd think they'd spend a bit of time making sure the servers aren't down for the first 72 hours after an update."
im a huge mgelord plat scout main
game sucks
"Team Fortress 2 has been a hit game since 2007. And now it's been a miss game since 2015. Bad development decisions in recent years, and overall not as fun to play anymore. But if you like hats, and I mean   like   like     hats, then go for it."
"Who cares about frags when you can become a dank fashion celebrity? Show off all of your swag in the best dress up game Valve has to offer. Spend about as much money in virtual clothing as you would in actual clothing, and prove to everyone who the real pro is."
"I would gladly reconmend this game. This game is Free to play, although the only thing is that you have 50 or 100 backpack spaces, I forgot, which is not enough really for all THOSE HATS. ._. Either way, this game will surely hook you and reel you in. Like I said I would glady reconmend this game for people who like teamwork, like to have fun, and likes cartoonish graphics. ^_^ Well, hope this helps decide whether or not you should play. c:"
"Amazing, just amazing, love everything about it!!"
"It is very good and smooth, i would highly recommend it to any FPS fan."
Hackers. Hackers everywhere. Nullcore has ruined this game.
Well it ruined my life so... 100/10 would bang... I mean play
"Team Fortress 2 is still a good FPS game, the most hilarious in a way. You don't have to take it seriously, you are free to laugh at that fat rancho relaxo engie on top of the pl_barnblitz skybox, watching him be useless. You are free to party with a ton of hoovies even though you can't move around much when there's so many around the door. Valve might not be doing proper updates for this Masterpiece anymore, but the community has developed so much since the game was first released. The community is still alive and rapidly expanding, it's more advanced now. There are so many community projects. The one main thing you have got to love if you are somebody like me when playing Team Fortress 2 is...the many bodies that get blown half way across the entire map, distracting that annoying enemy sniper who's just carrying his team, distracting the engineer who actually cares to look up, passing over the head of a heavy half way through his meal. Team Fortress 2 is still worth it, it is not dying, it is so SO ALIVE! Perhaps one of the most alive FPS games on Steam, this masterpiece has lasted for such a long time, even if it doesn't have any more long years to last, it was still worth playing it. This is the one game I would never give up on, it brings out all the fun and humour from me. Please...hit that download button and try this incredible Veteran."
"This game is amazing, have been playing for quite some time now (2500+ hours), gets better and better everytime! So much variety throughout the whole game (weapons, classes, loadouts combinations, maps, gamemodes). Whether you like or dislike this cartoony first person shooter, the gameplay of this game is amazing! Find new friends, try new tactics, this game is a blast. RECOMMENDED FOR EVERYONE!"
'The most fun you can have online' - PC Gamer 'The most hats you can have online' - ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Shiny hats.
"Very fun, once you start playing, you'll be calling five more minutes."
"I'm doing this review over, because I love this game to the bitter end and I love seeing the new updates.  The new Meat Your Match update brought in great ideas and an amazing system which had obviously taken some time to create by the developers. When the update was launched, however, they were greeted by the darker side of TF2 players. They all complained and complained about this update. Not giving it time to turn into something great, and leaving bad reviews for the most redundant reasons.   Give the game time, it hasn't 'died' in the slightest. On another note a portion of horrendous players have left the game, and will hopefully never return. These kinds of people don't need to be here, if you don't play the game for what it is, wether it be the core gameplay, trading, custom gamemodes, or just overall having fun, what point is there to you?   Play this game for what it is and watch it grow, some things may be good, other times bad, but in the end this is Team Fortress 2. This game will never die and will always be one of my favourites"

Best game ever 11/10 would ruin life again
This is a fun game to screw around on and play with your friends. its funny too get taunts and go and dance in the middle of the map 10/10 would taunt agian!

"As much as the trailers look amazing, the game itself is awesome as well. After you learn both pros and cons of each and every class, you know what counters you and what you can counter, giving you countless hours of pure fun. Multiplayer + co-op give you choice of whether you want to play with players against bots or players vs players. The game itself is easy to customize with many mods, sounds and custom models available, giving you the best Free To Play experience out there. Upgrading your account to premium, for as little as around 0,20 Euro (which is buying the cheapest item in the Mann. Co Store) gives you 8x bigger backpack and allows you to easily gain new items, as well as trade your existing valuable ones for others, which you can further resell etc.  The only con of the game is some little dislike against new Free To Play players from players who paid for this game when it was in the Orange Box. However the game is worth playing either way, I recommend it to everyone who likes some nice Multiplayer FPS action =)"

"When I saw free porn as a kid I was happy!  Today´s kids sure have no genitalia whatsoever. Going against hentai sprays... uneducated bourgeois, little, unthankful...  Oh the game? You read this for stupid and funny answers anyway as you already know it´s a FANTASTIC game.  Move on and bring your kids to sex ed for ♥♥♥♥s sake."
"This game isn't anything like modern FPS.  Why you ask? Well... it got this 'classic FPS' flashback thing for me. When I look back at Doom and Quake, I don't see any 'Bloody Screens' or 'Iron Sights'. Nor do I see health that regenerates on it's own. And this is probably a reason what makes Team Fortress 2 so fun to play.  The second reason is the gameplay: You got nine classes, each with it's own pros and contras, there's actually teamplay and you don't have any stupid 'scorestreaks' or 'killstreaks' or something else like most modern FPS feature and you got lots of weapons which can be obtained at random. Besides, you got a fun CO-OP mode called 'Mann vs. Machine' in which you fight robots and stop them from deploying a bomb.  The third reason is the ability to mod Team Fortress 2. There are many server with modded gameplay such as 'Zombie Fortress', 'Dodgeball', 'Prophunt' etc. and users actually have the chance to create maps for it. This is a feature I really miss in modern shooters, giving the community the opportunity to contribute to the game and have a large environment to set their ideas free.  The thourth reason are hats: You got them in real life, you get them in the game! It is a must to have them! (Unless you want to get called a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for no good reason.)  Even though the graphics don't apply for todays standarts, you have to remember that this is a game released in 2007. But why do graphics matter anyway when the game has good gameplay? I don't know.  Aside the good parts about the game, let's talk about the bad parts of the game.  Remember when I said that the hats are a must? I wasn't joking. Unless you can deal with people telling you that you're a 'f2p ♥♥♥♥♥♥', 'noob', '♥♥♥♥♥♥' and whatever verbal they come up with, you can just ignore this stuff. But those people calling f2p players evil things for not having any hats and /or cosmetics are literally ruining the fun for said players. Instead of helping them master the single techniques of the nine classes, they 'motivate' them to just stop playing Team Fortress 2. If you don't believe me then I dare you to set your loadout like a f2p and go join a server. Chances are high that you'll be called a noob. (This also goes for players who use weapons disliked by a large faction of the community.)  But all in one, this game has this 'classic FPS' charme, is fun and addicting. And to the new players: Don't let yourself down of those people calling you evil names for not spending money on some game and have fun!

Its awesome 
Don't get into this game right now if you are looking for the actual TF2 experiance. The Meet Your Match update has ruined Public servers which was the bread and butter of the average player. Even if fixed the features will only be on par of the original pubs. Casual is a misnomer. It is just larger competitve. Gone are the hoovies and spy crabs. TF2 is now the land of the try hard. Good luck having whimsical fun like before the update.
"TF2 ruined my life, I neglected my friends, family and girlfriend, i put tf2 before schooling and since i began playing i have become a social hermit, unable to rationalise or converse with normal humans, Now even my own parents do not accept me, tf2 is all i have, i must now become one with the children they are my only true comrades I ♥♥♥♥ED YOUR MOM LAST NIGHT!!!!!!"
Team Fortress 2! A great team based shooter with hats :3 ! I played Team Fortress Classic since its early beta days in the late 90's and it has changed loads since then. There are things in both games i dislike and love. But at heart iam still a TFC player and would still be playing if there was a player base in SA. But all round TF2 is a great game you cant go wrong.  Final Score: 80/100
"This game. Is free. AND BY GOD YOU WILL ENJOY IT! AMERICA!- The BLU Soldier, 1972  This game IS pretty much the most fun you can have online. It's well balanced but still has a lot of variety between characters, weapons etc. and is pretty damn funny too. I mean, you can get a Haunted Haunter Hat! What else do you need to complete your life? And, of course, it's free, and premium is enabled as soon as you buy any item, even one of the weapons costing about 30p, and is with you for life, and enables trading, and by extension the amazing economy the community has built up over the years. To be fair, though, to ultimately succeed in this game you must own hats. Miscs, maybe get some, weapons help too, but seriously, get hats. You wouldn't enter the world's #1 War-Themed Hat Simulator and not buy a hat, would you? So, as we all know hats and, even better, UNUSUAL HATS, improve skill, this game is technically Pay-2-Win. But if you think you can handle the hattening, and you have ANY space left on your computer, get this. There's no reason not to. It's free (UNTIL HATS). And fun. So yeah. Buy it. NOW."
"One of best multiplayer games out there, and its FREE.. Best hat-wearing simulator in the world. Fun gameplay with 9 classes, lots of maps and weapons, and goofy items. Definetly worth a try!  Only downside being the balancing issues. I like to play the game casually, and 95% of the time 'casual servers' are not balanced at all. There's rarely a fair and fun fight. Most of the times its just 3v12 matches with spawncamping...You'll spend more time respawning than playing the game. And since they've removed auto-balance and a way to switch teams, there's nothing you can do about it.   Im giving it a thumbs down, because of these issues, but i would recommend you'd check this game out anyway."
"TF2 used to be one of my favorite games. I used to play it everyday. Although, the game has gone downhill, With all these new updates. Developers don't play the game and they don't even interact with the community, now you can't choose what map and game mode you want to play. They took a look how CS:GO was doing and said 'Hey, that game's doing good, we should put in competitive and casual gameplay! Also just delete all valve servers so they'll be forced to play it!'. Now this game had been ruined, because the developers, who managed to create a fantastic game, were too lazy to even acknowledge what the community had to say! And they messed up the weapon stats, they just took perfectly balanced weapons and made them crap. TF2 was fine the way it was, now its garbage. I wouldn't recommend this game anymore."
i guess its worth getting for gmod if you have it but otherwise i dont find it very fun but that may be because most of my time is spent loading and not playing the game
"If you like the concept of Overwatch, and you're not ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Just play this instead"
"Sorry to see it go.  edit I had said some stuff before that prompted the review below - something along the line of TF2 getting spooked by Overwatch and deciding to mimic it. I said don't try to beat them at their game, beat them at your game. But knowing how people are, the dev's will never fully undo this choice, they'll just keep pushing forward with it. So I'm off to Overwatch. Thanks for the fun, though, guys."
The most fun FPS game ever!  p.s. If you got recently VAC'd on CS:GO please don't come to TF2 and ruin our fun. Thank you.
"Pretty fun game, I play it some times."
"I hope they change this 'new' layout.    I have a kid..... and a wife. Being able to jump in and out of games quickly and without much issue is what let me play this game. I'm not looking for some leveling up, competitive, 'best there ever was' game. I'm looking for a FPS that I can join and play real quick and, if for some reason (ie; child or wife with needs) I can jump out and take care of it and jump right back in. Not everyone can play all day and night. I'm not looking for a way to become a professional player or using this as a way of bringing meaning to a life spent in the basement of my parents house. I'm looking for a quick stress reliever that goes good with a mixed drink that I can play when the TV is playing reruns of Tom and Jerry or Minions for the 3rd time today. Seriously, the servers are taking longer to get me into a game to play and it's running worse (yes I have a crappy laptop that I play on) then it did two weeks ago. If you're looking for a different demographic then fine but until I see some changes to what this game once was I'm not going to be spending much time with it."
"Propably the Best f2p Shooter, wich is fckn awesome in Public mode. Tons of Weapons ,balanced class System many Gamemodes and Maps. The Graphics are looking nice also after ten years and the weapon Handling feels great. In my Opinion the best Free To Play Game on steam :D Unfortunately you cant play it as your main game cuz it get rly boring when you play it 6 hours the piece. I dont rly know why but it is a fact :P Nevertheless the Game is much fun if you play it with some Friends. (greetings to Lial) Jaruu Score: 83/100"
This game went to ♥♥♥♥. Don't play for 100000000000000$
"You start up TF2. You click on 'Find a game', and then proceed to click on 'Casual'. You start the search and you join a server playing plr_hightower.   Right outside the spawn you can see a sniper wielding the Sydney Sleeper, just going at it with the bodyshots. He has yet to get a kill, but he's still having fun. On the same map, up on the tower, you see an experienced Soldier with his Hale's Own rocket launcher, jumping where he wants to be and just farming kills. He's on his 15th kill this life.  Approaching in the air there's a rocket jumper Soldier with a market gardener. He crits the Soldier on the tower, 195 damage + knockback. The Soldier dies to the 'Trolldier'. The trolldier jumps away and approaching the top of the tower there's an Engineer. He places a minisentry on the top of the tower, but shortly thereafter he gets kicked by his teammates for ruining the TDM.  Down on the ground there's a scout and a heavy pushing the cart. They're both fairly new to the game, and they both seem suprised as to how they can push the cart that far without anyone contesting them. Around the corner, there's a crouched enemy Heavy with an unusual wielding a sandvich. The Heavy and the Scout take him out, and shortly thereafter they're both kicked. They just broke two TF2 rules- they killed a friendly and they pushed the cart on Hightower.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The thing about Team Fortress 2 is that all of the players above are probably having just as much fun. There's just so many diffrent ways to play this game, so many metas, so many mods, that everyone has something to do. If you're not enjoying pubbing that much- try competetive or trading!  If you're tired of that, try out mods like VSH or try rocket jumping or surfing! There's just so many things to do in this game. I've spent over 3500 hours on this game, and while I've been tired of TF2 many times before I've always come back. If I'm tired of surfing, I'll do pubbing. If I'm tired of pubbing, I'll try competetive. If I'm tired of comp it goes full circle.  TF2 has such an incredible and unique charm. It'll always hold a special place in my heart."

"I remember the hours between my minimum wage job and my jerking off in my trash-infested 450 square ft apartment, I enjoyed many a talk about mecha animes and reddit memes with the charming community of TF2 players.   The gameplay is confusing at first, as pressing the trade button will often cause you to get 'scammed' by fifteen year old South Californian jews. You may have to invest a lot of money in order to play the game, as picking up the game puts you very far behind your fellow hatters.  Also, for some reason the devs added this function where you 'shoot players' and 'complete objectives', don't worry though because the community all agrees none of that matters.  5/10, boring game i played because i had severe autism and depression"
"Until the morons at Valve fix autobalance in casual matches, I wouldn't recommend bothering to download TF2. It's SERIOUSLY broken after the new update. Autobalance doesn't even seem to be a thing anymore! I've been in casual matches with five players on one team, and twelve on the other. And even if you were on the larger and wanted to even it out a bit, you can't change teams!  And heck, why is ranking even a thing?! We already have enough classist morons with stupid cosmetics, so why are you giving the classists another reason to belittle other players?! And making the game a bit more competetive is fine, but why do I have to stay for an entire casual match to earn anything for it?! WHY IS IT CALLED FRIGGIN' CASUAL IF YOU CAN'T LEAVE AT ANY TIME!?!?!? AT LEAST BRING BACK AUTOBALANCE, YOU DANG MORONS!!!  You had a good thing here, Valve, and you freakin' blew it. Good job."
Polecam wam grę Team Fortress 2
"Lets get started with the facts about Team Fortress 2:  1.The hats are only a CHOSE to wear them, its not wanted. 2.If you dont like playing Defencive, you can play Offencive or Support 3.The fact that they are 9 classes make the gameplay perfect: Like sniping? GO SNIPER? Like scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of everybody? GO PYRO... OR HEAVY. Like beeing helpful ? Go Medic. And thats the thing. Its not only one dude that run normal and have normal health. Its 9 absolutely diffrent classes. 4.Diffrent Gamemodes 5.Diffrent maps 6.A lot of players to have fun with. 7.A lot sfm movies. 8.Have diffrent weapons.... not only skins (talking about cod) 9.Is the goodest part: ITS FREE!  "
This game is like sex and drugs. Combined.
"This game isn't anything like modern FPS.  Why you ask? Well... it got this 'classic FPS' flashback thing for me. When I look back at Doom and Quake, I don't see any 'Bloody Screens' or 'Iron Sights'. Nor do I see health that regenerates on it's own. And this is probably a reason what makes Team Fortress 2 so fun to play.  The second reason is the gameplay: You got nine classes, each with it's own pros and contras, there's actually teamplay and you don't have any stupid 'scorestreaks' or 'killstreaks' or something else like most modern FPS feature and you got lots of weapons which can be obtained at random. Besides, you got a fun CO-OP mode called 'Mann vs. Machine' in which you fight robots and stop them from deploying a bomb.  The third reason is the ability to mod Team Fortress 2. There are many server with modded gameplay such as 'Zombie Fortress', 'Dodgeball', 'Prophunt' etc. and users actually have the chance to create maps for it. This is a feature I really miss in modern shooters, giving the community the opportunity to contribute to the game and have a large environment to set their ideas free.  The thourth reason are hats: You got them in real life, you get them in the game! It is a must to have them! (Unless you want to get called a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for no good reason.)  Even though the graphics don't apply for todays standarts, you have to remember that this is a game released in 2007. But why do graphics matter anyway when the game has good gameplay? I don't know.  Aside the good parts about the game, let's talk about the bad parts of the game.  Remember when I said that the hats are a must? I wasn't joking. Unless you can deal with people telling you that you're a 'f2p ♥♥♥♥♥♥', 'noob', '♥♥♥♥♥♥' and whatever verbal they come up with, you can just ignore this stuff. But those people calling f2p players evil things for not having any hats and /or cosmetics are literally ruining the fun for said players. Instead of helping them master the single techniques of the nine classes, they 'motivate' them to just stop playing Team Fortress 2. If you don't believe me then I dare you to set your loadout like a f2p and go join a server. Chances are high that you'll be called a noob. (This also goes for players who use weapons disliked by a large faction of the community.)  But all in one, this game has this 'classic FPS' charme, is fun and addicting. And to the new players: Don't let yourself down of those people calling you evil names for not spending money on some game and have fun!

"When I saw free porn as a kid I was happy!  Today´s kids sure have no genitalia whatsoever. Going against hentai sprays... uneducated bourgeois, little, unthankful...  Oh the game?

"This game is the best game i have ever played in my life.  Maybe i have devoted nearly 3 years of my life and maybe $200 dollars spent at this point, and maybe $30 of those- alright 50 of those dollars were in the Mann Co. Store but it was worth it. It was worth wasting $200 dollars on pixels because this game... its something else. You go into it, you hate it, swear it off, and then you go back a week later and never stop playing this ♥♥♥♥ing godamn beatutiful masterpiece of a game. The gameplay, the players, the charming classes, the weapons, the cosmetics, the updates, the gamemodes, the mods, all make for a wonderful game that still holds up, after 9 years. A game that only come once in a lifetime. Team Fortress Two will always be a game that i will play, and will always treasure. If your reading this review you maybe have already downloaded the game, are one my friends, or are just bored and looking though game reviews, for some reason But if you want to get Team Fortress Two, and you have read this review, what the hell are you waiting for?"
When Valve say this game is 'Free to play' don't think you will never spend a cent in this game. This game really costs about 20 dollars a month. For hats. 11/10.

"Played this game since release, the latest update is the first time in the games long history that I wouldn't reccomend it to my friends."
after the recent updates i can honestly say that it has left me with mixed feelings TF2 doesnt feel like TF2 anymore it feels like the game became jealous of the competition with other more famous games (CS:GO Overwatch).And apart from that it feels boring i dont know how but every time i load the game i say to myself 'i will play sopme casual matches' but in the middle of the casual match i change that to a no and quit the game when im done while previously i could just stay in the valve server for like an hour or more but now i only play one casual match and thats it and the community servers are complete ♥♥♥♥ i dont want plug ins i dont want skial i dont want orange maps i want to good old valve servers  #makeTF2greatagain
"Everything is like, completly changed and yes, Casual is the same as pub but you cant pick what map you can play on and competitive is not balanced. All weapons are allowede not like tf2center where some unique weapons are allowede. it would be great if there could be 1 class each and not just like 3 engis on the enemy team (That happen yesterday) which is just completly unfair and not a chance to win"
This game is amazing it is super fun and you can do so much!!!!!!
Great game ======== -Cartoon feel that doesn't take away from the intense gameplay -Class based and requires class diversity/team work to be succesful

"This game is full of great things, and it's evident why this thing is so popular!  PROS  1: Class based warfare. The fact that this game has gone the class based system really adds some unique flavor to the traditional FPS scene.  2: Additional weapons are not uber powerful upgrades. This is something that works to this game's advantage! Every weapon you get out of luck is more of a Side-grade to your natural weapon which is actually the optimal weapon.  3: Cosmetic customization features DON'T effect the game(mostly). This is something that sets the stage for a lot of F2P games to suck, as most free games you play ask for you to buy what you want to win over everybody else. TF2 doesn't rely on that, and cosmetic items are a great way to show off your own style.  4: The most balanced F2P and modern FPS in the world! Unlike atrocities like Combat Arms(god I hate that annoying ♥♥♥♥...) the weapons are somewhat more balanced. Not the best balance, but clearly more balanced than the competition.  5: Intense multiplayer mode. this is a dealbreaker for this game! Since the focus is on TEAM play, it's only logical to encourage a great multiplayer mode. The sheer number of multiplayer modes are familiar main stays, all team variations of familiar modes. CTF, Control point, King of the Hill, and even adds some unique modes like VS Saxton Hale, and the user created 'Deathrun' and Race modes.  6: Each class has it's own personality! THIS is what can sell games! Each class has their own way of bragging, complaining, cheering, jeering, etc, the emotes really bring this home, it conveys a great personality for this game as each character is drastically different! No two classes play the same, and their personalities are actually hugely different.   CONS(This list was a LOT harder to come up with than you think)  1: the blance is not perfect. A somewhat minor issue, but what can you expect from a game with so much good going for it? The problem is, there's not really a way to avoid being one hit killed by a demoman grenade, a sniper bullet, or a spy backstab. what about making Soldier's rocket launcher a one hit kill weapon? Or at least follow through the 'Direct hit with a rocket means instant death' deal? I know there's a weapon called 'The Direct Hit' which has increased rocket damage, but it's not the same as a rocket with a decent blast radius like Quake 2.  2: Lacking in single player modes. It lets you play on maps you're familiar with, but if you picked up maps online, there are no bots to play against you. Of the more fun maps, there are Balloon race, and Wacky Races, which are the ebst user-made maps to date! These maps could use some bots running around for the thrill of it! Just in case you lose your connection or want to practice alone. The lack of a story mode is also a problem, what if I want to play alone and enjoy a story? Or even a more fleshed out tutorial that helps me learn how to counter classes against me using certain mechanics. A single player campaign with some old school flare would do this game a lot of good for solo players.  3: Inability to host games yourself on your own computer. This seems to be a trend with a LOT of games hosted on Steam. If you've not paid to host your own private server, you can't play exclusively with your friends. I remember old school LAN parties where players could make their own servers using their own computer to host their games. Why not do that for TF2? It's not impossible.  4: Not enough customization/cosmetic slots. Some things look amazing together, and some things are too cool to shelve. I would personally love to show off all my badges and medals at once, while flaunting hats, costume, and other cosmetic pieces, but there's not enough slots for them.  5: No 'Gender equality'. The lack of female versions of characters is kinda depressing. Given the timeline of the game, it's not surprising, but it isn't really that big of a deal. It's actually historically accurate which is very good. This is only really a major gripe if you want to play through gender equality. The only character who is androgynous enough to fit either or both male or female roles is Pyro, but that class is a lunatic engrossed in a fantasy world of balloonicorns and cartoony horns that shoot rainbows instead of spewing firey death!  6: The presence of jerks and griefers. This is a personal player to player concern, and not really Valve's fault. Griefers are going to walk in and cheat or exploit their way to claiming they have 'MVP status' or 'Top MVP'. These toxic abusers of the game, including 'Squeakers' plague the game. If there was a 'report Micspam/Squeaker' function that muted a player on a server for the benefit of everyone who voted to mute them on every server, it would be great. Simply muting them doesn't lways help, as some of these toxic players simply logout, then rejoin the map to get around being muted.   The Pros are huge compared to how minor the Cons are, but I recommend this game! At least until the CA fantards start crying for Sniper to be godmoded... I hate being picked off by a sniper... Rockets need to be a top damage one hit kill on quishy classes weapon."
i guess its worth getting for gmod if you have it but otherwise i dont find it very fun but that may be because most of my time is spent loading and not playing the game
"If you like the concept of Overwatch, and you're not ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Just play this instead"
"This game..... I have a policy in life. Never spend money on a F2P. I have sunk in $50 on this game for what?! Hats! Stupid, worthless, digital, hats! I could have gotten a new game or multiple indie ones for the same price but this, this evil, cruel, monstrosity of a game just did what it does to everyone. It starts off as a unasuming F2P. Its fun and a nice break from all of the Call of Duty clones out there. At first all you want are the weapons. Then one day you get it..... The Ghastly Gibous.   Everything changes.  Suddenly nothing matters in your life. By this point you are already adding all of your money on to steam to buy the latest and newest hats. It is no longer a game anymore. It is your second life. Your BETTER life. Life just becomes the flavourless sauce that takes up the extra space in the real flavour which is you and your hat collection. By this point the game has taken full hold in you. You are powerless as you watch your funds go down and down, only to go back up as you add 'just $2 more I swear'. But it's never just $2. Its 2, then its 5, then its, 10, then its 20 and on and on and on. Then one day it hits you. No one talks to you anymore. You are out of money. Your only friends are your hats. And worst of all. You are fine with it. You dont need them. It wont be long before they all submit.....   10 out of 10 would ruin life again"
I used to be a straight A student......... Now I'm not.........  Super fun and I am so glad I got it. Wouldn't change a thing!
"This is an amazing game that is very fun (and addicting) to play. A lot of work has clearly gone into the game design, but it would be far better if not for the heavy orientation on microtransactions. The way I've come to see it is this: People spend money, real money, which they put their own blood, sweat, and tears into earning, on virtual (i.e. not real) hats, which they can put on virtual characters in a game where you don't typically see other people up close for over ten seconds. Sound like a fair tradeoff to you? Me neither. Bottom line is, don't buy anything, and this game's a barrel of explosive, bone-crunching fun."
Worst game
hats
"Yo dawg, if u wunt a true FPS game, den get dis game mayn.  P.S. if you say COD is better, you better sleep with one eye open..."
This is a good game.
"Hat Fortress 2 is a wave of the future! Once you get past all of the other players trying to show off their hats as well as hit or miss patches, you get a wiggy war simulator/ mercenary dress up game zoi!"
I LOVE THIS GAME SO FREAKING MUCH!!!

"I've only played four about 2-3 hours max, but so far it's ok."
Microtransactions: the game  10/10
Super hat cool
hey
"Great game, play it all the time"
Probably the best hat themed war simulator on market
Let's get over this quickly:  Pros: -It's Team Fortress 2 ....  Cons: -Playing Swiftwater with 6 people because...reasons
"I've been playing this game since it's been out, i've played it to death on two accounts and i've spent a lot of money on it, i love this game and i love valve, but with that said i can't reccomend this game to anyone at this point, the dev team doesn't care enough to listen to the community about certain weapons being broken and just seem to be buffing and nerfing at random, they didn't even know that the bison being able to hit multiple times was its only redeeming feature, i've put more hours into the game then the two admins for the competitive beta steam group combined, and the only memorable thing that they've done outside of the comics since mvm has been a barely functional matchmaking system that they just ripped from mvm without even doing any thing to make it look different and somehow made worse even though it obviously was the same system. valve, none of your devs have any love for tf2 anymore, either find some way to make them passionate or give development entirely to the community, because if there's another update as bad as meet your match the tf2 community won't keep blindly paying money for new shiny hats in a broken game."
"This game is full of great things, and it's evident why this thing is so popular!  PROS  1: Class based warfare. The fact that this game has gone the class based system really adds some unique flavor to the traditional FPS scene.  2: Additional weapons are not uber powerful upgrades. This is something that works to this game's advantage! Every weapon you get out of luck is more of a Side-grade to your natural weapon which is actually the optimal weapon.  3: Cosmetic customization features DON'T effect the game(mostly). This is something that sets the stage for a lot of F2P games to suck, as most free games you play ask for you to buy what you want to win over everybody else. TF2 doesn't rely on that, and cosmetic items are a great way to show off your own style.  4: The most balanced F2P and modern FPS in the world! Unlike atrocities like Combat Arms(god I hate that annoying ♥♥♥♥...) the weapons are somewhat more balanced. Not the best balance, but clearly more balanced than the competition.  5: Intense multiplayer mode. this is a dealbreaker for this game! Since the focus is on TEAM play, it's only logical to encourage a great multiplayer mode. The sheer number of multiplayer modes are familiar main stays, all team variations of familiar modes. CTF, Control point, King of the Hill, and even adds some unique modes like VS Saxton Hale, and the user created 'Deathrun' and Race modes.  6: Each class has it's own personality! THIS is what can sell games! Each class has their own way of bragging, complaining, cheering, jeering, etc, the emotes really bring this home, it conveys a great personality for this game as each character is drastically different! No two classes play the same, and their personalities are actually hugely different.   CONS(This list was a LOT harder to come up with than you think)  1: the blance is not perfect. A somewhat minor issue, but what can you expect from a game with so much good going for it? The problem is, there's not really a way to avoid being one hit killed by a demoman grenade, a sniper bullet, or a spy backstab. what about making Soldier's rocket launcher a one hit kill weapon? Or at least follow through the 'Direct hit with a rocket means instant death' deal? I know there's a weapon called 'The Direct Hit' which has increased rocket damage, but it's not the same as a rocket with a decent blast radius like Quake 2.  2: Lacking in single player modes. It lets you play on maps you're familiar with, but if you picked up maps online, there are no bots to play against you. Of the more fun maps, there are Balloon race, and Wacky Races, which are the ebst user-made maps to date! These maps could use some bots running around for the thrill of it! Just in case you lose your connection or want to practice alone. The lack of a story mode is also a problem, what if I want to play alone and enjoy a story? Or even a more fleshed out tutorial that helps me learn how to counter classes against me using certain mechanics. A single player campaign with some old school flare would do this game a lot of good for solo players.  3: Inability to host games yourself on your own computer. This seems to be a trend with a LOT of games hosted on Steam. If you've not paid to host your own private server, you can't play exclusively with your friends. I remember old school LAN parties where players could make their own servers using their own computer to host their games. Why not do that for TF2? It's not impossible.  4: Not enough customization/cosmetic slots. Some things look amazing together, and some things are too cool to shelve. I would personally love to show off all my badges and medals at once, while flaunting hats, costume, and other cosmetic pieces, but there's not enough slots for them.  5: No 'Gender equality'. The lack of female versions of characters is kinda depressing. Given the timeline of the game, it's not surprising, but it isn't really that big of a deal. It's actually historically accurate which is very good. This is only really a major gripe if you want to play through gender equality. The only character who is androgynous enough to fit either or both male or female roles is Pyro, but that class is a lunatic engrossed in a fantasy world of balloonicorns and cartoony horns that shoot rainbows instead of spewing firey death!  6: The presence of jerks and griefers. This is a personal player to player concern, and not really Valve's fault. Griefers are going to walk in and cheat or exploit their way to claiming they have 'MVP status' or 'Top MVP'. These toxic abusers of the game, including 'Squeakers' plague the game. If there was a 'report Micspam/Squeaker' function that muted a player on a server for the benefit of everyone who voted to mute them on every server, it would be great. Simply muting them doesn't lways help, as some of these toxic players simply logout, then rejoin the map to get around being muted.   The Pros are huge compared to how minor the Cons are, but I recommend this game! At least until the CA fantards start crying for Sniper to be godmoded... I hate being picked off by a sniper... Rockets need to be a top damage one hit kill on quishy classes weapon."
"Medic/Soldier = medic with an uber = instant kill (valve hasn't nor will ever nurf these)  This games been out for years and the only thing going for it are the strange weapons with count kills. Hats are pointless but they're collective items.  the game itself is pretty good, addictive fun.. but i do recommend you play it as a free2play gamer don't spend any money in the store of micro transactions. "
"  Hats     Many, many hats  "
"Takes up way too much time, overly addictive. 14/10"
"10/10 - IGN, Best Hat Simulator Emmy Award winner, don't play this game if you hate hats, if you like hats, play it. One tip of advice: DON'T WEAR THE GIBUS HAT, IT IS A HAT OF SHAME."

It's a fun game
Very good game. Much wow. Great fun. Muuch wow. Large men. Much wow.
"One of the biggest and fun games i've ever played, and the best part is that it is F2P"
"Solid fps that's also free, what's not to like?"
"Fun game with personally funny challanges, constant bug updates with meh major updates but I'm fine, many inside jokes, great community really makes this game stand the test of time!"
"This game isn't anything like modern FPS.  Why you ask? Well... it got this 'classic FPS' flashback thing for me. When I look back at Doom and Quake, I don't see any 'Bloody Screens' or 'Iron Sights'. Nor do I see health that regenerates on it's own. And this is probably a reason what makes Team Fortress 2 so fun to play.  The second reason is the gameplay: You got nine classes, each with it's own pros and contras, there's actually teamplay and you don't have any stupid 'scorestreaks' or 'killstreaks' or something else like most modern FPS feature and you got lots of weapons which can be obtained at random. Besides, you got a fun CO-OP mode called 'Mann vs. Machine' in which you fight robots and stop them from deploying a bomb.  The third reason is the ability to mod Team Fortress 2. There are many server with modded gameplay such as 'Zombie Fortress', 'Dodgeball', 'Prophunt' etc. and users actually have the chance to create maps for it. This is a feature I really miss in modern shooters, giving the community the opportunity to contribute to the game and have a large environment to set their ideas free.  The thourth reason are hats: You got them in real life, you get them in the game! It is a must to have them! (Unless you want to get called a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for no good reason.)  Even though the graphics don't apply for todays standarts, you have to remember that this is a game released in 2007. But why do graphics matter anyway when the game has good gameplay? I don't know.  Aside the good parts about the game, let's talk about the bad parts of the game.  Remember when I said that the hats are a must? I wasn't joking. Unless you can deal with people telling you that you're a 'f2p ♥♥♥♥♥♥', 'noob', '♥♥♥♥♥♥' and whatever verbal they come up with, you can just ignore this stuff. But those people calling f2p players evil things for not having any hats and /or cosmetics are literally ruining the fun for said players. Instead of helping them master the single techniques of the nine classes, they 'motivate' them to just stop playing Team Fortress 2. If you don't believe me then I dare you to set your loadout like a f2p and go join a server. Chances are high that you'll be called a noob. (This also goes for players who use weapons disliked by a large faction of the community.)  But all in one, this game has this 'classic FPS' charme, is fun and addicting. And to the new players: Don't let yourself down of those people calling you evil names for not spending money on some game and have fun!  PS: Please excuse any potential spelling errors and faulty sentence constructions as my primary language isn't english."
Its awesome 
"Lets get started with the facts about Team Fortress 2:  1.The hats are only a CHOSE to wear them, its not wanted. 2.If you dont like playing Defencive, you can play Offencive or Support 3.The fact that they are 9 classes make the gameplay perfect: Like sniping? GO SNIPER? Like scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of everybody? GO PYRO... OR HEAVY. Like beeing helpful ? Go Medic. And thats the thing. Its not only one dude that run normal and have normal health. Its 9 absolutely diffrent classes. 4.Diffrent Gamemodes 5.Diffrent maps 6.A lot of players to have fun with. 7.A lot sfm movies. 8.Have diffrent weapons.... not only skins (talking about cod) 9.Is the goodest part: ITS FREE!

AMAZING F2P GAME!!!!!!!! This game is amazing it is f2p it has lots of trading action diffrent wepons to choose from its just overall amazing! its my fav game
Don't get into this game right now if you are looking for the actual TF2 experiance. The Meet Your Match update has ruined Public servers which was the bread and butter of the average player. Even if fixed the features will only be on par of the original pubs. Casual is a misnomer. It is just larger competitve. Gone are the hoovies and spy crabs. TF2 is now the land of the try hard. Good luck having whimsical fun like before the update.
"Sorry, but I don't like this game. For starters, it takes a very long time to load and that just annoys me even more. I don't like the large amount of rude people who play this game and these players are so overpowered, you're just going to die hundreds of times and you have to wait as much as 20 seconds to respawn, this was to balance the game, but I don't find a game fun when I die over and over and have to wait to play again. I should point out there is a lot of cyberbullying and racism when playing this game, these people should be banned from playing this game for life and Valve does nothing about it. These bullies just ruin the game for me. If this is the best free to play games have to offer, I'm not impressed. I'd still much rather pay money for a quality game than play a free game like this. Some people may like this game and that's their right, it doesn't mean I find you a bad person (I hate people like that). But this game just isn't for me, but if you want to try it, just be warned it has no mercy for newcomers and it's full of rude people who shouldn't be allowed to use the internet."
"I love it, been playing for a year, great community, items, and gameplay"
"Oh, this game? It's pretty good. I've played a little bit of it."
This game has always been there for me when I needed it. After playing this game for nearly 3 years I have lost my life to it.
Fun game and One of the best free-to-play game out there. Love the Character designs. I just can't get enough of this game! Play it and you'll understand
"I'm now broke, and have no life :) My favorite game ever."
"First 10 hours of playing: 'why the hell is everyone obsesed with hats?' 100 hours on record: 'this hat looks pretty sweet actually.' 200 hours on record: *has 10+ hats in inventory* 'ok, i see why people like the hats.....' I have spent over $200 on this game, not all on hats.... But there are hats in this game."
Awesome shooter love the cartoon graphics and all the variety thta comes with this game! free to play as well i strongly recomend it

"Close to 3,000 hours in this game as of now. There are highs and there are extreme lows. The content is stimulating and keeps many people playing for hours or coming back for more. Whether this is a good thing or not, depends entirely upon you're perspective. Overall, it's a game that leaves you with a fun experience, although it sometimes just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I'd say it's worth it for the amount of fun that there is still to be had, especially when you get together with your friends and pubstomp for a while. I'd say I recommend this game to anyone who has the time to spare."

"I use to love playing this game, but they took away all of the valve servers from the server browser. Now instead of finding a server in 5 seconds i have to wait forever in a casual search and its garbage. Whats wrong with you valve"
Meet your Match killed the game
"After 1000's of hours and years of fun. It has come to an end.  All things do sadly, I only wish I -- We all saw it coming sooner. I had already sold all my hats before so I didn't loose much.  Unless they fix the game, I'd only recommend this for the Gmod content.  I only wish everyone would share their honest review on this game, I had loved this game but I had also been slowly drifting away from it after the fist few 2014 updates. At first I didn't mind but then I slowly grew away due to the same old thing but whenever I hopped on I loved it.  Skip 1 1/2 Years, The Competitive beta update, It was alright I didn't really enjoy it though, just wasn't my type of thing at least for tf2, Coming from a Once Avid CSGO player.  After that there were amazing or at very least good updates that came and I started to play again. Skip forward a little and then I join the game and become....confused.  Where was Quick play? I could always just go to a Community server but...I liked pubs, Simple Vanilla Gameplay.  I looked around and just went to my Favorite Community server, after about an hour or two I got off and looked up where was Quick play in Tf2, to my shock, they had removed it.  They had removed possibly the most fun thing about the game and replaced it with a CSGO esce type 'Quick play'  Now it may have been a nice idea, but this drove me to buy an Xbox and GTA 5, along with borrowing CoD:Black Ops 1.  I've had more fun playing on a concle (Which I don't like to be honest, never been a huge fan of joy sticks.) Then one if not my FAVORITE game.  I don't blame Valve for this, I blame the person who came up with the idea and the people whom rushed it, I really do wish I could go back to when I first started and enjoy that moment once more.  I'd recommend to just stop playing until they fix it, if you really care about the game that way you don't just ruin your want to play like I did.  Best Reguards -Vul"

It's ok.
It's an alright game.
Probably one of the best games i ever played and i'm not kidding. I lose interest in games very easily and this game has kept me interested for so long which is very and i mean very hard to do. I love it how value is releasing very fun and new content in many updates. I 100% recommend this game.
Shout out to valve for systematically destroying the only decent first person shooter on the market.
"In all honesty, I truly did love this game. but after the Meet your match update valve botched a perfectly amazing game. -No more hopping in and out of servers. Prepare to wait up to 2-5 minutes to get into a match. -the Ranking system is screwed. You mess up once and those 5+ Hours you worked to get past the fresh meat (Level 1) Stage goes down the drain -Competetive. Seemed good on paper, Seemed like a good idea in beta, but once it goes to practice it has to work. Whats the point in buying taunts when you get punished for using them? Why turn a stable, light hearted community into utter toxic garbage? Why try to make a game thats not competetive into CSGO?  -Weapon Sets. Why try to be creative with weapons when you can just use the OP, cliche weapons that everybody seems to use? You want a degreaser? Too bad. The Phlog will put you down if you choose do use that. The Classic? Nope, Prepare to turn it into scrap and never use it when you have access to the stock, or the sydney Sleeper.   -As somebody who has put over 500+ Hours of their life into an amazing game turned garbage, let me just make this clear. Don't get the game. As of right now, TF2 Is just the weird little side project that valve has stuffed on a shelf that nobody really wants to get near. So unless they fix the damage that has been done, Its a waste of time to get this."
"Gun Mettle update literally turned it into csgo, this proves valve can get away with anything."
"With the current review bombing going on, I feel like I need to say this: Don't listen. It's just 'the fear of change'; something everybody has. And in my opinion, the changes aren't even bad. Most say 'the game is unplayable' while to me it's actually more playable than before.  There used to be something called 'Quickplay': Select a gamemode, press a button, you are in a server now. This didn't work half of the time. It either placed me in a map I hated, a server that is empty, or I ended up being connected to a server located in dubai (300 ms ping).  However, now we have 'Casual' and 'Competetive'.  Casual: Select which maps you want (or just gamemodes), click a button, you are now in a server GUARANTEED to have players in it. Sure it might happen that the match ends right after you join, but the game will start searching for a new match right away!  Competetive is basically just Valve trying to do a mix between the real comp scene and what most players are used it. It's simply a transition from goofy fun to serious business. It may not be perfect, but as long as it teached you what competetive looks like, it did it's job.  And if you don't like either, don't forget that there's still community servers: You can play the same map all day, play with community made weapons, stop a tank from reaching the end, or learn the art of rocketjumping. Nothing is impossible on a community server!"
It's Ok
"What can I tell you about this game that you haven't already been told... Oh yeah, Its the only game I know of where the ranking system is HATS,"
"So here's the 411. I've been playing back when this game came out for Mac.  Generally, a lot has changed since then. This update called 'Meat your Match' being the less favored update of them all, as it took a key feature away, that being quickplay, moulding it into a queue with other players. That's my only downside of it so far.  Investment wise, it's probably remained the same since mannconomy came out. You'll be spending money on keys to unlock crates, or crates that are already unlocked to get a strange or unusual variant item and possibly cash out.  There's the occasional aimbotter here and there, but heck. Server swapping saves us of that problem.  Overall, I consider the game at this point in time, a little less fair than it was."
"Don't spend money on this game, please.     Buy different games, please...."
The update is good        Kappa
"Dear Valve TF2 used to be my go to game but i had to get rid of it because i played it to much, So i thought maybe i should try uit again, WHAT IS THIS?!?!. No, i cant, *sobs* KIll me and destroy this cancer     Also overwatch is way better now"
"Team Fortress 2, or as valve calls it, Money Maker 2: Global Offensive.    Gay"
"TF2, is a terrible game for terrible people. You deal with addiction... You deal with gang rivalris... You deal with racism... You deal with breakups... You deal with grammatical errors... You deal with spelung arors... And you deal with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people who constantly scream 'MEDIC' on the top of their lungs for no real reason...  What im trying to say is, that if you like wasting a million dollars on virtual hats, the terrible spelling of the color blue, killing an exact copy of you team thats also a different color, the friendship of the BLU Demo and RED Soldier, and constantly being annoyed by your team,   THEN BUY THIS (free) GAME NOW (micro transactions included!)"
"It's a fun game, I played it for a little while."
"I'm bad at the game, I get scammed, My family and friends tell me to go out to the real world.  Why do I keep playing it                                                              End my suffering..."
"Edit: After 2 episodes of stargate finally joined. Edit no.2 : So updates came and joining now takes 1-2 minutes- soo... - yay ?! right ? - well unfortunately not, because more and more i play casual i recognize that old 'pubs' how we know them are in fact...dead. Iam not saying that its not fun, it is ...but not as fun as i had with old 'pubs'.    Update : waiting for casual server  going to wc  going back, still waiting for server  making food  going back, still waiting for server  watching one episode of stargate  going back, still waiting for server   11/10 would wait again"
"No one can ♥♥♥♥ up Valve's games quite like Valve.  Also Meet your Match has turned TF2's community into League of Legend's community, complete with an angry mexican in every match that's barely able to speak english.   If you're going to add ♥♥♥♥ing matchmaking to a game make sure the matchmaking ♥♥♥♥ing works you ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥ucking asseating dumb ♥♥♥♥♥. It doesn't.   Don't try to start playing TF2 right now, matchmaking is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ed and unless you know community servers to play on, you'll be ♥♥♥♥ed if you want to try to learn this game. The community is more hostile to new players than ever before, expecially given that the game is so much more competative-minded now, and new players tend to just drag entire teams down. I'll attest to this personally, never have I despised a gibus more than when he won't listen and continues ♥♥♥♥ing up for the entire team- or when half the team is comprised of people who have no idea how to play and will only pick Sniper or WM1 Pyro.   Don't give Valve any money for this abominable ♥♥♥♥♥torm. They don't even playtest ♥♥♥♥ before pushing it out anymore. They don't have to care, because no matter how badly they ♥♥♥♥ up TF2, they'll still rake in millions from Steam. TF2 is ♥♥♥♥ing dead. GG volvo, GG."
"Despite all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t with the Casual and the attempts of Valve to 'improve it' , this game is still one of the best FPS out there, having an unique cartoonish style with bunch of weapons/hats/taunts to choose from and a pretty friendly community. If you think playing this game is a mistake, I can assure you it's the best mistake you've made."
"What the f*ck are you doing, Valve? Why the f*ck did you get rid of quickplay and turn the pub servers into inaccessible casual servers? Who the f*ck thought that the Meet your Match update was a good idea? Where the f*ck are the as*hats who are supposed to listen to what the remaining TF2 players have to say? And WHEN THE F*CK ARE YOU GOING TO PUT IT RIGHT!?  Do you people even give a sh*t about what the people who play your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game say in regards to what would make it better?  I mean, who the hell requested that on top of a decent idea like adding competetive mode that you get rid of quickplay? We're not here to spend 80% or more of our time waiting for a match to be found. Thanks to this farce, Many of the best community servers have died thanks to the quickplay no longer sending people to them. It's bullsh*t! In trying to 'improve' this game, you've done nothing more that turn it in an absolute mess, to put it politely.  Enough with this being quiet sh*t, TALK WITH THE PLAYERS! Let them tell you what to do once in a while, because guaranteed, the intelligent ones will give you the ideas needed to save this little money maker of yours. Here's one off the bat, Bring back quickplay for those of us who don't give a crap about your overpriced competetive mode."
"TL;DR: Look for an alternative if possible, unless you are competitive jesus.  I have been playing this game for around 3 years now. 1000+ hours poured in, and i always had fun because you never knew what will quickplay throw you into. Then, Valve has started slowly turning the game into gold mine for themselves. Hats were okay, because you didnt really give a damn about them, but Cases with weapon skins was actually too much. Afterwards, Invasion with its stupid campaign pass. Just shown how the TF2 team (or Valve, if you really want to) became greedy.  Then, the long awaited competitive beta arrived. Since it was in beta, i could easily tolerate the issues, and unfinished parts of it. Now, we got Meet Your Match. And this is where sh*t really hit the fan. You see, they updated quickplay not so long time before this update. Now, we got 'Casual mode' which is f*ked up. By this, i mean it is LITERALLY competitive, except you dont derank. The balance hoewer, is a big issue. You see, it is not very fun to be crushed by Pros from competitive with purple or red medals (which shows their rank) when you get a team of newbies. If i would want this, i could just launch Battlefield 3 and select the quickplay.  And what about the competitive mode? Its in the same state like it was in beta. You cant rank up because losers leave the game seconds before victory. If you are lucky enough to face a manly team who accepts the defeat, you gain little ammount of points, which fills up 10% of your experience meter. Now, lets say, you were lucky enough to fill it up to 80%+. You lose one time, but you get gold medals for everything. You should gain some points or, at worst, not lose anything, right? Nope, you lose it ALL. Just from a single loss.  Also, if you would like to play on Quickplay like servers, prepeare yourself for pain called community servers. A lot of these have ads and VIP / Donor with perks. And lets not forget possible abusive admins too. If you find one that is actually GOOD, you can congratulate yourself.  Now, lets talk about the WAR a little bit. Pyro vs. Heavy, seemed like a fair match right? Both are effective at close range only. Hoewer, you had to select a TEAM and you would earn points for it with ANY class. Pyro won, will get his new weapons and, uh, 'Rebalance'. If you remember how bad other rebalances were (Phlog buffs, Scrotch Shot, etc.). Even that it was said that the winner, will just get his update earlier, I doubt heavy will get anything. In case he will, it will probably be another reskin or another trash weapon.  The Game is just not fun anymore. As i said in TL;DR, Look for alternatives if possible."
The Most Important Game of My Life. 10/10
.
its da best and its free whoopee!
"This is the straw that broke the camel's back. I could go on about all the broken ♥♥♥♥ in this update, but why bother? Valve clearly thinks it's acceptable to halfass their work, so why should I devote any serious effort to describing this trainwreck either? This update is so abysmally, comprehensively poor that I don't know where to begin.  I'm not going to queue up for literally 3 minutes to play 3 rounds of koth, with half of my team missing (they're missing because the game is overrun with hackers, and they can't be kicked). "
I used to love this game  Now Volvo took a HUUUGE ♥♥♥♥ on it with Meet your match update U GET PENALISED FOR LEAVING A CASUAL MATCH WTF I have 400 hrs on my other acc and i played this game and thought i would love it forever GJ Volvo u killed a loved game kys
BRING BACK PUB PLS NEW MATCH MAKING UPDATE IS OK BUT FIND GAME IS TOO SLOW AND TAKES HOURS TO FIND A GAME PLS BRING BACK PUB : (
"Did you ever hear the saying 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it'? Well that's exactly what Valve. The game was perfect until you added the new competitive mode. TF2 was a casual game, with no intention to ever have a competitive mode, but Valve looked at CS:GO and said 'Wouldn't it be great if all games wold be as successful as it? Well, why don't we make our second best game just like it and see if it works?' and it clearly didn't. Valve ruined the casual fun play of TF2 by removing the quickplay, nerfing what didn't need to be nerfed and not nerfing what did. I really hope they restore this game to its former glory and not into TF:GO"
For a few months there was a race between Overwatch and Team Fortress 2 and it seems like Valve couldn't take the pressure and shot itself in the foot with this update. I really hope TF2 will recover from this tragedy that is this update. (written at 07-15-16)
"This game was execellent. It was fun, addictive and I could decide to screw around however much i wnated with no real consequences. Then the march update came. This game is now a complete pile of crap. It take 30 minutes to find a match and I have fast internet. Now my deaths are counted so if I want to scew around I can't because that willl killl my KDR. The inventoryis TINY........ it forces you to pay for an upgrade which I will never do. But then i have to deal with constantly deleting items whichis really annoying....... on purpose. This was a great casual game at one point but now even in the casualmodeyour KDR ratio is counted which essentially makes casual competive. Remove the leveling system, profile KDR and giant wait times and this game would be amazing but until then I vow to never play it again."
"I know what happened recently, removal of pubs, removal of quickplay, but despite all of that, I don't think much of value was lost. Pubs were just a mess, how many times did you see your team just not doing anything? Or enemy team just letting themselves get killed? I say, one too many, twenty too many, the first time I saw 'friendlies' I already disliked them. There are community server that are all about friendlies, and I admit, I sometimes go on them because that's what brought me to Team Fortress 2, but I always kept the fun on fun servers, I always try my best on objective focused servers, and what some people decide to do is not only be dead weight on their team, but also help enemy team. With addition of Casual mode, in about 30 matches I still haven't seen a single friendly... Everyone is focused on the objective, chat is actually used to communicate, and people say 'gg' or just rage in the chat after a loss or a win instead of it just being silence between rounds. Now if you win or lose you can see it being justified, and not just because a Heavy that was supposed to defend the last control point was sharing Sandviches with enemy Demoman. The levels are purely cosmetic, you get xp no matter if you lose or win, but somehow the casual mode added this semi-competetive element to the game and sense of progression. Casual has some problems, but they are being fixed, you can't choose a map, but it's being made by TF2 team right now, you can't votekick but this issue will be adressed later. This gamemode gave me what I wanted, a stress free way to achieve an imaginary 'rank' that doesn't reflect the way I play, while also making people actually play the game for once."

"What happened with Team Fortress is a true shame.  I religiously played TF2 for almost 3 years due to its alluring, chaotic nature and the ability to jump into a game and have fun whenever I pleased.   It was unrestricted in the sense that you could do literally anything that you wanted, like sit in a corner and eat a sandwich, or jump around and play mindgames with the enemy team, or play the game like normal.  This was taken away from TF2 with the addition of the Meet Your Match update, where a person could no longer jump straight into a game, and you had to suffer unbearable loading times with casual/competetive play, and autobalancing wasn't there to fix unbalanced teams, leading to a terrible game and a waste of time.  I understand that the TF2 team is nothing but a small group and can't do everything at once, and I don't expect all too much from them. The fact that the past 2 major updates were filled with major, game-breaking bugs and released for everyone to play was rediculous. I believe there can be new measures to be taken, such as a closed/open-beta for players to try out and exploit everything wrong. That will probably never happen though, and I expect broken updates to occur in the future.  I don't think the future of TF2 will be very bright from this point on, and it's not worth even getting into, so please don't waste time on it.  Thank you for reading my opinion!"
"TF2 is a realism simulator. You start off as a F2P baby trying to learn the basics of the game. As soon as you find out how to play the game you get a reward. That special reward is the Ghostly Gibus, the most beloved hat in the game. You're getting addicted to the game, and try to get as many items as possible via achievements or drops. After that you get better at the game and the are 2 ways to continue. You ask your parents for money or stay a F2P ( but an experienced one). When you continue as a premium player you are in able to trade your precious hats and buy other goods from the Community Market. But, you're addicted to TF2 and buy even more items, you spend hundreds of dollars on Unusuals and Australiums. In the 3rd part of your TF2 life, you're an elder professional player with expensive goods. You're still unaware of phishers and scammers. Your very first phishing experience: you lost all your items and have to start all over again. RIP Credit Card, RIP Items, and RIP Life. 9/10 This game needs more r34."
"It was one of my favourite games...WAS! Because Valve really dicked us over with the new update.  First of all: No Vlave-Servers (Pubs) anymore which is especially frustrating considering thats were most people played...me included but now you have to wait 2 hours just to get in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ casual match  I personally dont play competitive but its probably the only good change in this update. Its a good new addition but the casual mode is just unnecessary in my opinion and also why werent new weapons added? The only thing is a melee reskin! We have too many of those!! (Pan, Ham, Hammer, Golden Pan, Australium Melees and melee-weapons with skins)  And im really sick of Valve just putting out ♥♥♥♥♥♥ updates like this... I mean every single update for the last two years or so have been complete and utter bull**** Its like they are just trying out dumb ideas in this game for the use in other games or something and we tolerated that for long enough. But now im just sick of it.  So if you wanna play Team Fortress...just wait for the new update ok? maybe the next one will be decent  Welp, gonna go off playing some Overwatch now, bye"
team fortress 2 more like nice meme am i right????
Good. Wasted money on hats. 10/10
I have Spent so much time/money on this game....but its ok...because i have hats...lots...and lots....of pixilated.....hats..... ;-;.    PLAY THIS NOW
"REVERT THE NEW UPDATE - BRING BACK THE OLD QUICKPLAY.  Until then, my TF2 will remain uninstalled."
"I didn't know what to write about in my review, so here's a recipe for pancakes instead:  1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon white sugar 1 1/4 cups milk 1 egg 3 tablespoons butter, melted  1. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.  2. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot."
I like Potatoes more than this game.  I'm so fresh you can suck my nuts. GG 11/10
"Very good game, you should play this game alot, nice friendly players. All kinds of server are on tf2, oyu should play.. ! :)"
"This game ruined my life.  First it started, with me just shooting stuff as soldier. I died. and died. and died. I got mad. I then pressed the , button. And that is where it all started: Spy. I sucked at it sure, and kinda do still. But as I got my first backstab. I went insane. Backstab after backstab, it felt so good. Soon, I just went offline on tr_walkway, not to practice, just to get a few backstabs. Then I met some people, who would let you backstab them for only a few Mann Co. Crate Keys. I bought one key and did it, then all of the sudden, it turned into dozens and hundreds of keys. I had to sell my dog, sell my house, and go to 7/11 just to buy a damn steam card. I just had to get THOSE DAMN STEAM CARDS MAN. Every backstab I got felt so good, but I knew it was wrong.  So damn wrong. So then the night after. I invited my family over. I went to 'get a soda from the store' When I came back, there were police cars, and all of the sudden, when they let me inside. My family was dead. With the wallets on the floor. Nothing inside. Then I realised. There were 50 dollar steam cards in my hand. The cops rammed me to the ground and started to tell me my rights. I went to jail for 7 years. I bought a crappy apartment and a Mac. and now here I am. Still getting backstabs. This game ruined my life, made it impossible to get a good job, killed my family, and am now going to kill myself soon.   I guess the game is pretty good, 10/10"
New update suck. Bring pubserver and fun back pls.
"I've played TF2 for 5 years now. I love the comedy, gameplay, and everything about it. It's really an amazing game. The reason I absolutely hate it now is because of the new update. I thought that TF2 was actually good. We used to be able to make servers, play on custom maps with friends, join amazing minigame servers, and other flawless things. When Valve made the change to basically making TF2 a fictional CS:GO, I was about to die in my chair. TF2 was a good game, and then Valve screwed us over."
Appealing to little children...
"This game used to be great. The gameplay still is, but the new 'Match making' and 'Casual' mode have ruined the overall experience.  Maybe they'll get rid of levels in Casual mode,  allow you to search for a single mode  [can now do this but it doesn't and it does stay selected that way after the game ends],  remove the disconnect at the end of a game (this is such a pain in the ♥♥♥) , shorten search times,  allow a game to be played until victory or defeat rather than just further or faster than the other team.   That last bit seems like it would lend itself to a casual mode, and it could grow on me, but without auto balance once the crybabies and competitive players seeking to up their stats and level realize their team is losing they leave just like they always have. Then it's completely one sided and no longer fun. [The games play giving both teams a full chance now. However, with autobalance removed when people start bailing on a onesided match-up (sometimes horribly onesided) you can end up stacked 2:1]  This is an old game people still played the ♥♥♥♥ out of because it was just plain fun. It was *already* casual. It was funny. And for some it was *already* competitive. Why it was turned into something it never was is beyond me. Maybe new players will find it great, but plenty of us long time players just find it a chore.  I'll cross my fingers, but unfortunately the way game companies make up for making mistakes is tweaking the mistakes rather than removing them. Time to fade away...  [UPDATE: There have been some 'revisions' to the last update. Basically they walked back some of the crap. Which I am pleasantly surprised with. Unfortunately the worst part is still there; You are kicked from the server after one game. Which means as sore losers leave a game, you get dropped into the last minute of a hopeless battle on the wrong side of the map. And then *BAM* you are kicked and it starts over, and over again.]"
"becuase of removing autobalance games are now unfair with very unbalanced games, i with the timed things is confusing and will scare away new players. overall if they dont fix it soon tf2 will be no more.(note that they have started to fix it)"
THE BEST GAME EVER 
game is for greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that want to fk over other people
"apsolutely one of the best games you'll ever play. So much fun, and worth your time."
Hat are the best weapon in this game (9/10)
"its not that good, became boring pretty fast"
"'The most fun you can have online.' True to the last word. Add to this the fact that TF2 is free - it makes for a great deal! :D I bought the game along with The Orange Box via retail, so I have a premium account; and boy, is it worth it. Though there isn't a lot of difference in free and premium, you should buy it (I recommend the orange box - it costs like USD15 when bought via retail in India, and just USD15 for 5 games is awesome!). The multiplayer game modes including King of the Hill, Payload, Control Points, are all great. The team behind this game releases new game modes as free updates at times (the Halloween game mode) - these 'extra' game modes are epic! You aren't even restricted to one set of weapons, you can keep collecting weapons via random drops or craft them; almost every weapon in the game is obtainable in this way, excluding limited edition ones, etc. The new co-op mode (Mann vs Machine) has added a whole new dimension to the gameplay. THUMBS UP!"
Holy ♥♥♥♥ I found a gibus so rare lol  whatarehats/100
I LIKE DIS GAME A LOT
This Game Is Great But Is A Pay To Win Sometimes 
my favourite game
"♥♥♥♥ing awesome , ruined my life (Y)"
"My personal experience with Team Fortress 2 is a great one, meeting new friends and have a great time.  However over the years of playing Tf2 I've noticed the community has grown to be very sour and toxic along with valve spoiling this game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ major game changing updates, I'd say that the glory days of TF2 are now over and it's basically like CS:GO with a little mix of call of duty's community. The game has lost it's charm and I now realize that it is very important for good games to eventually die off. Valve has been constantly trying to make this game relevant every year atracting idiots, children and item obsessed players, so unless you have a time machine don't bother even playing this anymore."
"Literally crack cocaine in video game form, do not download unless you enjoy playing video games for 2000 hours or more"
Oh this is good!  10 pootis / 10.
Homosexual men fight for dry grass in sweltering weather for two old farts. 10/10 its a scam.
"Hats, hats, more hats, and guess what? HATS!"
HEY THE NEW UPDATE NOT SO GOOD ! WE CANT EVEN CREATE OR  SEE THE SERVER LIKE BEFORE ! WE ONLY CAN JUST JOIN RANDOM SERVER LIKE CMMON ! IF THERE WERE A GAME AWARD FOR THE DUMBESS UPDATE IN  THE WORLD IT WILL GO TO TF2 RIGHT NOW !
"So you're looking for the right game for you huh? Well then before you ask anyone else you need to ask yourself some important questions. First and foremost, do you love hats? If you answered no then stop reading here but if you answered yes then you're off to a terrific start. Lets continue..  Do you love hats so much that you're willing to ruin your life for them? If yes, don't wanna spend your money on steam games but only on hats? If yes, will you use your spare time adding steam users so you can trade or get items to make more hats? If yes, find yourself joining servers only to show off your favorite hats you've crafted/collected? If yes, do you find it difficult to take your finger off the mic buttion? If yes, are you unable to restrain yourself from calling people hackers or cheaters? If yes, do you sometimes cry out like a 12 year old after this happens? If yes, are you 12 years old?  If you made it this far I think we found the right game for you. Enjoy!"
meet your match ruined everything
"this game is the most greatest game to exist its graphics are amazing its weapons are creatively designed,its game modes are super fun,the one thing that annoys me is crates  so i am giving this game a 9 out of 10"
"Good game, check out our steam group! :D"
"It's fun, it's free."
"is free to play  no p2w   $1,876.04 spent so far  10/10 would empty my wallet again"
TF:GO is what this game has become
"Pros: - Good Graphics for a game of it's time. Cartoon-ish, but that's what makes it seem timeless! It's gore and bloodyness somewhat makes up for that. :)  - 9 distinct class that take different kinds of skill to be good with, with their own personality, body build and height difference, Instead of the typical shooters where all the players look the same or very little differences.  - Cosmetics, You can dress your self up with different hats, pants, and other cool/crazy stuff. (Cost money though, or can get through in-game trading)  - Hell of a lot of fun when you work with your team and coordinate. Public Matches just tend to be all out deathmatching to get to the objective. But, when the planets come into aligned, you may just come across that, and it's a glorious thing to be apart of. Still fun regardless!  - It is updated every so often with new content. (Weapons, Hats/Cosmetics, Maps) usually cosmetics.  - There is also Competitive leagues you can join! UGC, ET2FL are 2 of them. If you want to get away from the stupidity and casualness of some public matches, but without being too serious, go to TF2Center and do some Lobbies! Make sure to have a microphone to communicate. :)   ________________________________________________________________   Cons: - Hit detection is wonky. Sometimes you'll shoot and hit someone, but doesn't do any damage.  - Balance problems. Some maps favor a class(es) too much, some weapons are too weak, or situational, very few are too powerful, some are gimmicky and broken. When you play this game about 500 to 1000 hours, You'll know exactly what I mean. Overall, it's not too severe.  - Most of the time when a new update comes out, it's breaks things, some weapons will be invisible. Sometimes even a player will even be invisible to you! Weapons will be upside down, etc. Just a bunch of little bugs that happen. Usually gets fixed within the next update or 2.  - Not optimized well at all. FPS gets worse with the addition of new weapons and cosmetics. Some maps are horrible in performance.  Overall, it's a good game. Try it! It's free."
"It was my favourite game, it WAS my favourite game... But no... Valve had to make totally no-sense updates. As the most of people saying, Tf2 it gone for now... I'm reeally waitnig for repair."
this game is fun
YES I RECOMMEND IT ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED EDICTING FUN TRADEING :D CANT GET ANY BETTER TAHN THIS ALSO FREE!
"I LIKE HATS, THIS GAME HAS HATS, 10/10 ALL ROUND PERFECT HAT FEST."
I LOVE this game!
"This game is the best. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reg, unbalanced classes, and cartoony graphics. It is all saved by one thing. . .HATS! What are you waiting for? Download this Hat Simulator for FREE!"
"The only game in existence that determines your high score via:  &gt;How many expensive hats/weapons you own (Lol, American economy, much? Oh, wait, it is? Dammit.ogg). &gt;How many duplicates of an item you own (Different coloured text - Levels of Autism over 9000). &gt;Degree of autism. &gt;How many purple hearts (painted gibuses) you are presented with by butthurt squeakers in exchange for a Vintage Max's Severed Head. &gt;Lack of sunlight. &gt;How much awkward porn you've seen outside of any booru. &gt;How much monies you've spent via microtransactions, that should've been used for vital necessities. &gt;Will ruin your life, and instill a disinterest in living.  Best Game Post 200-  I give this game a whopping: 9/11  Would recommend to 'friends' and 'family'."
favourite game on here
this game was good before the big update recently. Now it sucks ♥♥♥ and isnt as fun as before
"i recommend this game its just that valve realy screwed up. Meat your match update braly made a ong reload time, you get a penalty for leaving a game early. Literaly now i miss autobalence. bring tf2 back valve"
This is my review n.n
"HAT FORTRESS 2,   Obvious trading game now..the compettitive side has hackers running free and valve doesnt give a ♥♥♥♥..because hats!..all people care about is how thier sparkly 'digital item' looks, rather on focus on the actual gaming side.  I Sure hope a matchmaking system comes into play soon to give life to this dying community.   Edit..  The biggest turn off for me was the end of the line update..i was so hyped for that..i'm sure everyone was.. what did we get?  Flaming duck unusuals, also a $5 rubber duck event. *obvious cash in anyone?'  No new map for months because 'too advanced'. A community made map was refused. Despite unpaid efforts from the community creators for a year. And yet we get more hats? *cash in?'  A new gamemode with grappling hooks and 9 modifiers is okay though, Entirely broken, shouldn't even exist. but it's okay, because valve.  Fundamental changes to classes that have existed in a thriving game for 7 years, because apparently they were the reason this game went downhill. *cough* hats.. *cough*   Also, gimmick weapons that seek to support the handicapped players. Danger Shield still in. Minisentry is still broken. I'm sure they will fix it! after another 600 hats come out!   I used to play for the community but ive tried to press on..found some rather tight ones..but overall the tf2 community right now is toxic. It seems the good old players have moved on, i don't blame them. If your new to the game i suggest sticking to valve servers because a community server will eat you alive. They hold no respect towards newer players and will spam binds on you if they kill you..eg 'get rekt noob'   I used to love this game, but i came to my senses. The games dying and so are you..run while you still can. Valve you still have a chance at fixing this we don't need anymore hats we need more maps and gameplay!   Valve, Don't treat this game like your bank account.  We the players deserve much better then this."
You can become a millionaire in this game. Greatly recommended.

TF2. A game where if you're bad you are a F2P or if you're too good you're a hacker. A game where if you are wearing no hats you are worthless or if you have 20+ unusuals you are lifeless.. TF2 Community in a nutshell 9.67456/10

It's TF2! So nice and epic!
"Community: TF2 is dead Valve: (Releases an update) Community: TF2 is dead Valve: (Releases another update) Community: TF2 is dead Valve: (Releases an update with big changes) Community: TF2 is dead,time to move to Overwatch  Buy OverWatch you thank me later                  at least Blizzard cares about its customers and has good support"
It's ok.
"This a wonderful and fun free game to play. It might seem childish with the cover but it a game more brutal then you think. In the game you can chouse between 9 awesome charaters with all diffrent abbilities. There are diffrent types of game plays which you will learn fast when playing. You play against and with other players in teams, (red and blue) but you can also play against robots and if you wifi down you can play offline against bots. In the game you reseve hats and master acheivements. You can also trade hats and weapons or buy them in the Valve Store. Havent tired Team Fortress 2 yet then i really think you should!"
Scout FTW
The only first person shooter where you can be a black scottish cyclops! 3/10 'Not enough diversity' -Gamespot
"the games dying, i hope valve knows that a minor percentage of the players actually play competitive and by catering towards them they are leaving 99% of the community behind they have no idea what they are doing with their game. this update was lazily put together competitive mode is useless condidering someone can leave and no one gets xp. on release their were penalities for leaving casual. they nerfed the bison claiming it being able to penentrate enimies is glitch even tho its been on the loading screen since pretty much the games release. every update we get it seems like valve has never played the game. atleast with overwatch they have test server s and blizzard ingteracts with the community. while valve is completly silent. some people seem to like the new menu UI i think it looks ugly. valve should just give us quickplay back and leave future updates to the community."
was really good fun.Was.........
"This isn't what you would expect as a FPS. It looks amazing, the hats and cosmetics are unique and diverse in their own little way, the characters have very silly communication commands, Heavy makes me laugh everytime. (Pootis) The gameplay + game modes are amazing even since they have a new one that was unused in the last update. 1O/1O ▬ Great Game!"
Meet Your Match Update. Enough said.
I missed playing Tf2 after a 2 week absence. Logged on to find only the 'Casual game mode'. This saddens me.
"it is quite fun, still i think the original is better because now the game is played for the hats and items you can get for your dumbass player -,- and little kids screaming because they got ripped off"
I am spending ages trying to find a server. I miss the old layout.
"its ok, could use a few bug fixes, remove pyro and demo, all and all maybe a 1.9/10"
"I was on 2fort, it was a great day, but my nemesis Georg.navoic03 was on the server, he had his feared Achivement item Machina, his colored Gibus, and his Mercenary badge. little did i know that he would bodyshot me multiple times as i tried to cap the intellegence using my best tactic avalible, the SpyCrab  "
"I would recommend this game to veteran players of any popular franchise like Halo, but if you are just a starter ; Dont even start playing this obnoxious game. Why? you would ask? Because it's not worth your time and money (if you think about buying keys)  The economy has gone down sideways and item prices are too high, not only that ; the gameplay is simply stupid in any way. are you just a rookie? lets put you in a team full pro players whereas you can't kill a enemy player because your team is too damn good, this goes vice-versa for the other team (they are too good and you lose instantly) and if you are a pro player ; lets put you in a team full of oblivious rookies that will never support you, the matchmaking and balancing is that awful"
Very child friendly. I would reccomend this game to friends and family of all ages! My toddler absolutely loves this game!
"This game is like cigarettes, at first you don't like it and then suddenly you are hopelessly addicted, wasting all your money and the only thing that pulls you out of your crippling depression is it. Ummm Uhhh, I mean, it's real fun."
Its a ok game..
Really fun co-op game
"I cannot for the life of me understand what valve is doing. Back in the day we had a fairly vibrant community of servers, then valve decide to create a quickplay option to get into valve pubs which effectively killed off most of the community servers. Fast forward to today and the Meet your Match update and what have they done, killed off the quickplay and pub servers. WTF?"
This game is awesome!
"After playing ~2000+ hours, and more on my old account that is gone, I have made my conclusion. This game is fantastic and incredibly fun, trading is great once you learn and adapt, as hard as it is. Took me a week to get from garbage to a ♥♥♥♥ unusual to a 32 key one to a 72+ one. But alas, with the latest update, has rendered all valve servers, unplayable for me. More than likely if you're experiencing incredible lag on this game in valve servers, it's just the ♥♥♥♥in' servers.   On this day of 7/26/2016, after playing for more than five years, I have deleted TF2, goodbye old friend, kys."
"This is a very strong team playing game that will be useless without a team I strongly suggest buying this game if you are new to valve or steam. Oh, its also free-to-play."
This game is the single most-played game I have ever owned...

Welcome to Team Fortress 2  Please hold.
why must i suffer the pain of playing tf2 every day of my life
"Totally addictive, endless hours of fun and collecting. Plus now its free!!!!"
"Although i felt lazy on reviewing a game that the main purpose is to have fun, i cant ignore most of the flack people are making just because things were changed in the last update. the game is still great to play, the gameplay was not changed, but most whinning comes from the revamped matchmaking modes valve added which replaced quickplay and removed pubs. just because it removed these servers doesnt mean the end of the world. so if anything, just give it time because the long wait times are bugs since it bearly released. many people don't get that idea in thier head and go on ahead and rate the game down. if you don't like waiting, then look for a community server, its not bloody rocket science. ignore the ignorant comments and just play the game, its great and it still remains as my favorite team based shooter."
"Would I recommend TF2 pre-update to new players? Yes.  Would I recommend it now to new players? No.  Meet Your Match (or Meat vs Match) was the hyped up summer update for TF2, which was supposed to add in ranked matchmaking to (presumably) compete with Blizzard's latest IP, Overwatch. The beta for the matchmaking had been going on for over a year but suffered from issues such as not enough penalties for abandonment and long queue times. A lot of these issues have been documented since the launch of the beta, but weren't considered minor because people assumed Valve would fix them by the time it came out of beta.  Valve, as per tradition, did not fix anything in the final release - The only new thing added was the shiny new medals as well as changing the look of the menu so it didn't look as much like a clone of the MvM (Mann vs Machine, the Co-Op mode which was added in 2012 to a good reception.) waiting menu. Infact, chances are it is a clone of the MvM waiting menu as there have been reports of players trying to play MvM and ending up in Competitive or Casual games. However, this is minor compared to the other things this update caused.  When the update first dropped, the 'Quickplay' features was removed - A feature that allowed you to get into a game in mere seconds. You could choose from a large list of options, such as if random crits were on/off (A feature that would make a players weapons do 3x damage, based off of how much damage you've done recently and RNG). The 'Quickplay' menu was replaced with another clone of the MvM menu, which still had long queue times - DESPITE there being thousands trying to connect at once. When the Casual mode first dropped, it had things such as restrictions to how many gamemodes you could choose to play on, with 2 minimum and ABANDONMENT PENALTIES for CASUAL mode - A mode for players to jump in/out of the game. The last 2 issues were patched within a week by Jill, one of the two developers working on TF2 at the time, due to the huge backlash caused by the community. They removed the main way people played the game and replaced it with a buggy mess and somehow thought the community would like it, which to me proves even more that the developers don't play the game themselves and instead base it entirely off of statistics, such as almost buffing the Reserve Shooter (A weapon hated by everyone for being too strong and annoying to play against).  Time and time again, we would get excited for a new update but time and time again we're dissapointed. Gun Mettle, which was released over a year ago now, was considered to be a good update. It added several balance changes as well as skins (Shamelessly ripped off of CSGO, mind you) along with some new maps and contracts, which gave players more to do. Seeing the success of Gun Mettle, the TFTeam decided to copy and paste it and chuck a new name on it for the Tough Break update, which wasn't recieved as well as Gun Mettle but was still considered as a decent update, despite having replaced Smissmass, one of the game's major yearly updates. However, 2 good (non-community) updates proves nothing with the obvious lack of playtesting the new updates get, causing long queue times and the 'ranked' MM giving too-severe rank penalties (One example is when a player won a match and went down 1.5 levels).  However, the biggest kicker is that to get the pubbing experience we once had, we have to go to the Server List, which was fine when the Valve-owned server were on it but isn't fine when in 2013, Valve killed most of the decent community servers with an update to Quickplay, leaving only ad-heavy and heavily modded servers as the survivors. Now, Valve expect us to use those same servers to do something we could do pre-update just fine.  The devs say they can hear us, but like my dog when I tell them to get in the bath for a wash, they're not listening to us."
"I think my game time explains my opinion about this game. But seriously, this game has enough content to keep you playing for quite a while. If not interested in the actual game, you can always try trading!"
Vale you have done a great job sir i love teamfortress2 so much and thank you for makeing it keep up the amazing wrok mate. :D
i am decide 4 a good way 2 kill some1 is because u r have to open it. ?
"This game was good. It had potential. Then Valve just stopped caring. Classes are incredibly inbalanced, many mechanics are outright broken. They killed the community and then suddenly did a 180 flip by removing pubs in favor of Casual but now the massive amount of quality community servers has already taken a near fatal blow from Quickplay so I don't expect it to pick back up again.  Play if you want to but I don't really advise it anymore. You missed the glory days and Valve doesn't care enough to try again."
Boring tbh.  I'll still reccommend only if you are looking for free games.
Greate game i played it on 3 other accounts and its so cool
"Longevity is tough for competitive shooters. Hardly a month goes by without new virtual arenas cropping up and enticing you into some fresh conflict, and only a few popular games manage to sustain active player bases even a year after their initial release. And then there's Team Fortress 2. Released in 2007, this class-based classic is still going strong well into its seventh year, thanks largely to its lively and creative community. Since GameSpot's original TF2 review, the game has benefited from numerous updates and made the jump to a free-to-play business model. So how well is Team Fortress 2 faring in 2014 among the current crop of competitors for your time and money?  The short answer is, it's holding up very well. The core action pits two teams of players against each other in a battle to capture points, move a cart, or steal a briefcase. The objective is always very straightforward; it's the interplay between the nine playable classes that makes things so varied and interesting. The speedy scout, the militant heavy, the diligent engineer, the conniving medic, the pesky sniper, the sneaky spy, the feisty pyro, the explosive soldier, and the even-more-explosive demoman all have unique weapons, attributes, and abilities that complement each other and clash in myriad ways. Encounters can vary widely depending on the match type and the makeup of each team, and this unpredictability is crucial to TF2's long-standing appeal.  When you come out of the gate as a heavy with a medic in tow, you're a formidable offensive force, but if a spy loops around to backstab the medic and you round the corner on a pyro, it can all come undone in a matter of seconds. Snipers can cover expected enemy paths, but rocket-jumping soldiers have a knack for finding alternative routes and raining explosive death from above. You may think you have a comparatively weak scout dead to rights, only to be stunned by a baseball and beaten to death. As you watch your giblets splatter on the ground and see a freeze-frame of your gleeful killer, it's hard not to chuckle at the sheer variety of ways you can meet an untimely demise. And the humorous quips, ridiculous outfits, and histrionic announcer help cultivate this lighthearted tone.  Of course, this core dynamic has persisted for most of TF2's life span, so if you stopped playing it a few years ago and come back for a few matches, you'll find things are very familiar. Learning the ropes and getting the hang of your chosen role is still a gratifying experience, and mastering advanced techniques doesn't just make you deadlier; it gives you more options for how to approach combat. Keeping your options open is still valuable too, because being flexible with your choice of character can help you avoid ending up on a catastrophically imbalanced squad. It is Team Fortress, after all.  But though there is much that has remained constant about the core game, there have been some notable changes over the years, as well as regular infusions of new weapons and items. Of the hundreds of things available in the online store, some can be unlocked through play, while others must be purchased with actual money. From small doodads that cost less than a dollar to massive bundles that cost hundreds, there's a wide range of ways to customize your experience.  No Caption Provided Many of the items offer nothing more than a playful twist on the game's already cheeky cartoon aesthetic. You can buy hats, shirts, shoes, and other cosmetic gear to dress up like a character from Adult Swim or don spooky seasonal garb that you can wear only during Halloween or a full moon. Even if you don't fancy shelling out for any of this stuff, it's fun to see some visual variety as you try to light your opponents on fire.  Other weapons have more of an impact, like the ones that give your character a new chargeable and expendable power. The scout can build hype, which turns his usual double jump into a triple, quadruple, or quintuple jump, and the soldier can build rage, which allows him to rally his nearby teammates to do extra damage. Skills like these have more of a meaningful impact on the action, bringing something new to the table that your enemies must contend with. And then there are the totally out-there loadouts, like the one that turns the grenade-launching demoman into an extra from the movie Braveheart.In addition to the cosmetic options, there are a lot of weapons and items that offer small buffs or subtle tweaks to your attributes. Depending on which healing gun the medic equips, for example, he can imbue himself and his targeted ally with extra damage resistance or enable himself to match the speed of his target. Differences like these don't do much to change the core action, but they do give experienced players substantial room for strategic variation.  These options broaden the field of viable strategies, which helps keep combat lively and varied. And fortunately, none of the purchasable weapons or items tip the scales unfairly towards those willing to pay. Buffs and bonuses usually come with caveats, and the weapons that bestow new abilities are usually unlocked for free. For this review, I spent some money on goofy hats and some of the stranger weaponry on offer, like the pyro's flamethrower that actually shoots bubbles and rainbows. It was fun to play with the new gear, but I still found myself switching my loadout between free and paid weapons regularly to adapt to the match situation.  The biggest divergence from the game's origins comes in the cooperative mode, Mann vs. Machine. In it, you and a few other human players must prevent hordes of robotic incarnations of TF2's classes from delivering a bomb to your base. The money you earn from destroying robots can be spent on mid-match upgrades to your attributes and weaponry, which can be crucial to success. Even on the easiest level, the robot legions are fierce enough to test the mettle of an unorganized team. This is a mode where carefully planned weapon choices and defensive strategies can mean the difference between succeeding and having to try, try again. You can play this mode for free, but you won't be eligible to earn rare prizes or complete challenges unless you pay a dollar for a Tour of Duty ticket. Though it lacks the frenetic unpredictability of competitive play, the cooperative mode can still provide satisfaction for those dedicated enough to see it through.  But competition is the real draw, and the Team Fortress 2 community can certainly be competitive. On some servers, you might be berated for unwitting breaches of etiquette, while on others, you might be welcomed with helpful tips and ubercharges. You can even ask for help on certain servers and be paired up with another player who is willing to give you some tips through chat. The community around TF2 is an intriguing one, not just for their deep knowledge of and passion for the game, but for their creative efforts in designing new weapons, items, and maps that have since become part of the experience. It feels like a community of curators, without whom the game may well have dwindled away and passed into obsolescence years ago.  Staying relevant even a year after release is rare for a competitive shooter, and yet, here's Team Fortress 2, still lively after seven years in the business. At times it feels like the same game you could have played back then, and at other times it feels like no one will ever quite nail class-based shooter competition the way TF2 does. The experience has evolved over the years without compromising what made it so great in the first place, so though your free-to-play options may have increased considerably in the past few years, there are few that do it as well as Team Fortress 2."
"I love the game itself... but it took 3 days to download and takes even longer just to load. Please fix this; I love this game.  Update:  No more problems anymore with the game, love it, fantastic quality for a free game."
"Team Fortress 2 is an incredible gem. It definitly has to be my most favorite game. Throughout the six years I've played so far, it has done nothing but provide the combination of fast-paced action and great movement, the hard work of developers and the community, and the joy of virtual headwear. The Meet Your Match update has to be one of the most tremendous things that has happened to this game. Newer and casual players can utilize community servers or casual play, and more cutthroat pros can have fun in the competitive mode. As Team Fortress 2 has grown, like so many other games, decisions had to be made. Like so many other games, these decisions are met with hate from the loudest players. I feel as though Team Fortress 2 has recived tons of hate for an update that is just a week old (as of writing this review). These players complain about the game coordinator (which puts you into servers) being broken, or matchmaking being full of bad players, or some of the restrictions the TF2 team has placed, and even configs which can make your game unstable. These players generally make very vague posts or reviews, or say that valve will never fix these problems. Already, the TF2 team has made countless updates and blog posts stating that they are listening. They have fixed bugs in the game coordinator or added new options for casuals. They have personally said sorry for the rough launch. They have been quick to release patches, yet players just seem to want to hate. As you read the reviews, take each and every one with a grain of salt. There will be server errors, weird bugs, and ragers. The queue time may be long (2 minutes tops), the items server may go down, or your game might crash a few times. To me, this is just regular valve game antics. No game has ever had a launch or patch where players are happy. People got mad when Overwatch came out and the servers were down and games like CS:GO has had over-powered weapons that were patched after a week of complaints. TF2 is enjoyable. It has been for a while now, but people always find little excuses to start a riot. The game is free, so why not try it out yourself? Constant updates, huge amounts of content, a thriving community, and a team of developers that will listen to your every word. Play a couple rounds, and make your own judgement. Do not let reviews of petty issues or fixable bugs keep you from playing."
"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding cheese cake recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients:  1 cup digestive plain sweet biscuit crumbs 3 tablespoons sugar 3 tablespoons melted butter 40 ounces softened cream cheese 1 cup sugar 3 tablespoons flour 1 tablespoon vanilla 1 cup sour cream 4 eggs  Directions: For The base:. If you're using a dark pan, preheat the oven to 350. If you are using a shiny pan, 375. Combine the crumbs, melted butter and 3 tbsp sugar well and pat onto the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. I also like to very very lightly butter the sides of the pan so that the cheesecake will not stick later on. Bake for 10 mins in your preheated oven and remove. Let it cool while you prepare your batter. For the batter:. Make sure everything is at room temperature. Combine sugar, cheese, flour and vanilla in a big bowl and mix on medium speed till well combined. Don't forget to scrape the bowl as you're doing this. Mix in the sour cream till its incorporated well. Then, add the eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition. Pour the batter into the springform and let it bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes After the baking time, turn off the oven and leave the door ajar. Let the cake cool in there for about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the cake and let it cool thoroughly. Refrigerate overnight. Release the sides of the springform. Eat."
here lies good 'ol tf2.. killed by meet your match update
"Team Fortress 2 is an amazing game. It is very skill based. Unlike other games, such as CoD, tf2 has no weapon unlock system and the weapons are as balanced as possible (unlike games like CoD where a weapon is better than another no matter what). The game play is very fast and fun. You need to pay attention to everything around you in order to play at the best of your abilities. Even though there is a limited number of weapons (there is quite alot though) there is always new gameplay stratigies and tactics to discover and learn. No one class is the best class to play, each one has their own advantages and disadvantages that may make it better to take out one class but harder to counter another. Many people that begin playing tf2 often give up quickly thinking they are not good enough, but everyone needs practice we all started bad at one time. Even if you are not getting alot of kills you can still be a great deal of help to the other team by being a distraction, providing health and damage buffs, or picking off a single class on the other team that would otherwise give your team a dissadvantage.   Regarding the trade system, i consider it a quite good economic simulator. I have used the trade system to gain funds in my steam wallet and buy even more games without the need to spend alot of cash in real life.  Team Fortress 2 also has things such as a costom scripting system, and the ability to make your own hats and game modles. But that is mostly not for all people and tf2 is not generally played for that."
..
Man TF2 used to be a really good game and my number one favorite game I would play it almost every day. until this f#cking ♥♥♥♥♥♥ c#m update shows outta nowhere and changed almost everything. The Sticky Jumper and The Rocket Jumper have changed and they look like F#cking sex toys and even the sounds on almost every weapon have changed. And the main menu Heavy vs Pyro that seems so f#cking stupid. I can't pick any maps on multiplayer And now after seeing all that sh!t it makes me feel like I don't want to bother playing TF2 anymore because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MEET YOUR MATCH update.                 WHAT HAVE YOU DONE VALVE!!!!  
1-Install TF2 2-Play an online mission 3-Exit game 4-Open A.V.A 5-Get Holy Mackerel 6-Uninstall TF2
was good now its sh*t (in my and my friends opinion)
"Let's be honest... Overwatch's more fresh, and definitely better than this.    Now watch this get as much hate as Infinite Warfare's trailer   "
"The gameplay got boring for me, getting pub stomped, getting one shot because random crits are a thing. Glitches, a class devoted to walking forward, a horrible community that will get mad at you for killing them and they kick people who kill them. F2P's get farted on for being new. Thats the tf2 community. What about the developer of the game? They will provide you with updates making the game even worse than it is. I wish I didn't spend money on this game. I have invested too much money on a game that is making a fool out of everyone whos been playing it for a while. Bye tf2. The fires burnt out for me."
"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is certainly an excellent game, the best of the series, with the graphics qualities.  Matchmaking brings a real interest in the game by providing a constant increase in its level and offering games based on its level through the presence of a rank system, it is increasing or decreasing the contrary based on win / loss matches obtained.  The acquisition of different badges and trophies displayed on their profile and the ability to get weekly boxes to receive new skins for its weapons is a complete success and brings a real interest in the game.  In addition, every quarter a new operation allows us to discover completely new maps and fill new goals for a new badge.  Very good game!  Score: 8,5/10"
"Such a good game, really recommend you play this awesome fps game, although the hitscan weps are kinda crazy X) But you'll get used to it like i did."
no good updates  only lag spikes
"When I first got the game: wowie, this is fun! 50 hours in: Getting sort of bored... *finds community servers*  200 hours in: Still fun as ever! Meet your Match: nope.avi welp, time to go to overwatch"
"HEY CORAL ITS TF2, CORALLLL! LETS BUY HATS!"
"Team fortress 2. Fun Quick-moving Fps. PERFECTLY set classes nothing is 'unfair'! Good players (besides annoying little kids) But what game doesn't have kids? Fun maps! Amazing gameplay! Bugs are fixed instantly! Amazing items! Fun Events!  I highly reccomend this game to all fps fans. Anyone who says tf2 is...lame, boring or even unfair is completely....utterly wrong!"
"Totally addictive, endless hours of fun and collecting. Plus now its free!!!!"

The beta for the matchmaking had been going on for over a year but suffered from issues such as not enough penalties for abandonment and long queue times. A lot of these issues have been documented since the launch of the beta, but weren't considered minor because people assumed Valve would fix them by the time it came out of beta.  Valve, as per tradition, did not fix anything in the final release - The only new thing added was the shiny new medals as well as changing the look of the menu so it didn't look as much like a clone of the MvM (Mann vs Machine, the Co-Op mode which was added in 2012 to a good reception.) waiting menu. Infact, chances are it is a clone of the MvM waiting menu as there have been reports of players trying to play MvM and ending up in Competitive or Casual games. However, this is minor compared to the other things this update caused.  When the update first dropped, the 'Quickplay' features was removed - A feature that allowed you to get into a game in mere seconds. You could choose from a large list of options, such as if random crits were on/off (A feature that would make a players weapons do 3x damage, based off of how much damage you've done recently and RNG). The 'Quickplay' menu was replaced with another clone of the MvM menu, which still had long queue times - DESPITE there being thousands trying to connect at once. When the Casual mode first dropped, it had things such as restrictions to how many gamemodes you could choose to play on, with 2 minimum and ABANDONMENT PENALTIES for CASUAL mode - A mode for players to jump in/out of the game. The last 2 issues were patched within a week by Jill, one of the two developers working on TF2 at the time, due to the huge backlash caused by the community. They removed the main way people played the game and replaced it with a buggy mess and somehow thought the community would like it, which to me proves even more that the developers don't play the game themselves and instead base it entirely off of statistics, such as almost buffing the Reserve Shooter (A weapon hated by everyone for being too strong and annoying to play against).  Time and time again, we would get excited for a new update but time and time again we're dissapointed. Gun Mettle, which was released over a year ago now, was considered to be a good update. It added several balance changes as well as skins (Shamelessly ripped off of CSGO, mind you) along with some new maps and contracts, which gave players more to do. Seeing the success of Gun Mettle, the TFTeam decided to copy and paste it and chuck a new name on it for the Tough Break update, which wasn't recieved as well as Gun Mettle but was still considered as a decent update, despite having replaced Smissmass, one of the game's major yearly updates. However, 2 good (non-community) updates proves nothing with the obvious lack of playtesting the new updates get, causing long queue times and the 'ranked' MM giving too-severe rank penalties (One example is when a player won a match and went down 1.5 levels).  However, the biggest kicker is that to get the pubbing experience we once had, we have to go to the Server List, which was fine when the Valve-owned server were on it but isn't fine when in 2013, Valve killed most of the decent community servers with an update to Quickplay, leaving only ad-heavy and heavily modded servers as the survivors. Now, Valve expect us to use those same servers to do something we could do pre-update just fine.  The devs say they can hear us, but like my dog when I tell them to get in the bath for a wash, they're not listening to us."
"I think my game time explains my opinion about this game. But seriously, this game has enough content to keep you playing for quite a while. If not interested in the actual game, you can always try trading!"
Vale you have done a great job sir i love teamfortress2 so much and thank you for makeing it keep up the amazing wrok mate. :D
i am decide 4 a good way 2 kill some1 is because u r have to open it. ?
"This game was good. It had potential. Then Valve just stopped caring. Classes are incredibly inbalanced, many mechanics are outright broken. They killed the community and then suddenly did a 180 flip by removing pubs in favor of Casual but now the massive amount of quality community servers has already taken a near fatal blow from Quickplay so I don't expect it to pick back up again.  Play if you want to but I don't really advise it anymore. You missed the glory days and Valve doesn't care enough to try again."
"This is a very strong team playing game that will be useless without a team I strongly suggest buying this game if you are new to valve or steam. Oh, its also free-to-play."
"This game is just so fun. I'm not even a big FPS nut, but the fast pace and varied classes are just great!"
"It's still fun after +900 hours. Community can be pretty stupid at times, but don't let that cloud your judgement."
THIS GAME RUINED MY LIFE!!!! ITS TOO FUN!!!!!! I'VE SPENT LIKE 300 HOURS IN IT!!!! WHY GOD WHY D:
it best f2p game you can it
"I've not played this game too much but it's okay i guess, I'm pretty new with only 1 or 2 hours in"
Very very fun cx
"used to love playing this game. Now i go online the servers are filled with petty tryhards who happen to know alot of swear words. Cannot go anywhere without at least one of them showing up and ruining the fun for everyone. The game is great if you find the right server with a nice micro-community, but the competitive update ruined it."
"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is certainly an excellent game, the best of the series, with the graphics qualities.  Matchmaking brings a real interest in the game by providing a constant increase in its level and offering games based on its level through the presence of a rank system, it is increasing or decreasing the contrary based on win / loss matches obtained.  The acquisition of different badges and trophies displayed on their profile and the ability to get weekly boxes to receive new skins for its weapons is a complete success and brings a real interest in the game.  In addition, every quarter a new operation allows us to discover completely new maps and fill new goals for a new badge.  Very good game!  Score: 8,5/10"
Its okay I guess.
What are you reading reviews for? Bloody install it already.
10/10 best war themed hat simulator on the market... It's actually the ONLY war themed hat simulator on the market. so whether you're looking for a war themed hat simulator  or not   (who am I kidding) get this game!   On a more serious note. This really is one of the best multiplayer FPS in existance. Why is it so good? Becuase there is so much freedom as to what you can do.   Want to kill people? there are servers for that.  Want to kill robots with some friends? there are servers for that.  Want to have a party and murder anyone who tries to stop you?(like you wish could do in real life) there are servers for that.  Want to get beaten to death by a drunk Easter bunny?(yes) there are servers for that.(seriously)  want to make cheesy reviews?  there's an  app  server for that
"can't explain this, that game is really good..."
Really fun game!! 10/10
Cant stop playing...Just...cant.
I don't know who thought any of this new update was a good idea.  You have to pay $10 for competitive. Are you not draining enough money out of your players? You can no longer choose which map or server you join for casual play and there is now a penalty for leaving the server even for casual play. Basically taking out much of the fun that was tf2. Finding a match also takes forever.   I'd avoid playing until they realize how much they've ruined the game and fixed it.
"This game is amazing I played it for 2 years and took a break for 1 year but when I came back to my suprise most of the community was destroyed, The loading time has Extended just to get into a game and Hackers I've recently joined a game which I got kicked for speaking against a Hacker, now keep in mind that the hacker was in my team, I saw this as a cowardly move, I've never understood why people would go as low as using cheats. Anyway back to the story, I got kicked by my own team why they protected the hacker is beyond me. People like this, that hack and protect the hacker, ruin this game. I love this game and Intend to keep playing this game but this needs to change."

it's s h i t
"I click on this game, and suddenly all my money disappears, and I have all this stuff appearing in my backpack. It steals my moneys and I love it."
This isn't Overwatch.
"People may have different opinions and thoughts of this game but I honestly think this game is horrible. Now don't be the kid that says 'well look how much hours you have I bet you enjoyed this game!' That's true but I started to hate it over time once the updates start rolling in. Another reason is the hats and domination, people don't care about the objective and decide to go for domination or kills. Also the hats... way to many people are trying to show off their hats. Don't judge me we all have our own opinions remember that. But overall its your choice TF2 could get better or worse in the future. Take a break from it if you dont like this game, thats what i did."
"Terrible game: Explosions, death. You step out: you die.  Edit: I suck at this game. (recommented by a commenter and i felt truth in it, but everything above is true)"
"TF2 is the best and funniest online game ever! It's really awesome and it's made by the giant VALVE! This game is the game that never bores you, it couldn't be better, congratiolations Valve. Just play it... It's free ;)"
2/10 no iron sights
"It is fun little game to play. You can count it in kids game, casual or even competative, it has all to meet everyone needs. Combining quality and price of the game, Il give it strong 7/10  Recommended as fun game to all players."
"this game is 9 years old, and its so broken its unreal. like comon hitboxes are ♥♥♥♥ed melee weapon ranges are ♥♥♥♥ed, cancerous community, stupid updates.. trying to be counterstrike with those ugly skins.. when you play it feels like its in alpha, but remember its 9 years old. 9 YEARS OLD.  "
"Alright so let me just start off by saying that I bought this game two days ago for the sole purpose of getting to know what it's like to be high, but instead i got terminal autism. That doesn't mean that the game is bad though, it just means that the game is terrible. Anyways, at least 100 years ago I tried to sell some softcore drugs like PCP though TF2 outpost but immediately got met with by the party van. It was all good though because I bribed them with some PCP as well and they let me free, so luckily this game saved me once. Though, it didn't save me that one time when I was planting garden sheers in my lawn. See it's a kinda long story but what basically happened was that I was travelling down the street with my homie to buy some dank weed like zippo lighters but I forgot to bring $4 so we couldn't buy two and a half zippo lighters, only two. I then wondered why I only had $4 and then I realized that I spent $60 on this game. It was a sale though so I didn't really get a bad deal. Before I went out though I asked Volvo if they could get me my $60 back so they proceeded to hire only the best hackers in Nigeria. Or something. They hacked the Valve Source Incorporation which fooled them in sending approximately 300 confirmed Pizza Hut deliveries towards the Valve Corporation. When the Valve Corporation proceeded the transaction, the pizza delivery boys were quickly and effectively robbed of all their cash thanks to the Terrorist Organization of Harvesting Rice (i still recommend you buy this rice btw) so they unhesitantly sent all the $60 they acquired to Volvo. Little did they know though that Volvo was plauged with corruption in disguise of a car mechanic (that's what the editors told me anyway) and they were in fact eternal worshippers of the video game Team Fortress 2 which I think is a popular game, never heard of it though. Anyways the important thing is that I never received my $60 and i still don't have any half-Zippo lighter. Would not recommend this game to smokers of marijuana. Game may have unintended side effects to zippo lighters that have toured Vietnam in the year 1753."

Greatest game ever!!
"The game is very well balanced with 9 classes with unique abilities and weaknesses. Valve continues to update and add more maps all the time. The animation and voice over work will have you chuckling as you intensely battle for intelligence and capture points. Also there are a lot of random gamemodes such as Deathrun,Jailbreak and so on...have fun! "
This is one if the games you need to have in your steam library cause it's so good.
"Stunning graphics, been playing for a looong time and it gets better the more you progress. Has an interesting community and lots of different gamemodes! 10/10"
10/10 best hat simulator If you have a terrible computer that can't play gaemes and mommy wont buy you a better one. this is for you   Feeling lonely? Meet the (tm)gaming community. it's ♥♥♥♥. And you'll totally quickscope mommys credit card hardcore with all the hats you NEED.
"Team Fortress 2 has made it's way up my list, to be honest, and is easily the best free to play game I've ever used. With easy controls for those used to PC gaming, it has a rather small learning curve. There's no pay to win, as the game is just set up in matches and weapons you earn through gameplay (No, you don't HAVE to spend money in this game) are nerfed and powerful in different areas to be able to be balanced. For example a shotgun may have more bullets shot, but you can only fire it twice before reloading. The game is intuitive, the game is fun, and the game is addicting. A big download, but it's definitely worth it. Thanks Valve for the game that I have been enjoying. Pros: Fun Game Hilarious Graphics Ingenious Characters Wide Variety in weapons  Cons: Not enough character customization. If they added more of this, like applying colors to your gear and being able to add decals to shirts and stuff (Like even just steam group insignias) then this game would nail a 100/100.  Final Verdict: 95/100. Great game Valve."
"The game was great before the new update, i mean it still is great but in a competitive aspect in the competitve mm, it is terrible, i constantly am stuck with getting match ups against players who are rank 8-10 this being insanly unfair, valve please change the ranking system so the elo is more balanced."
Wasted 1/3 of my life. Haven't regret a single second.   11/10 -IGN
"The game was grat, up until an update occured which deleted most of the australian servers. Now I can`t play"

"Casual gaming was killed on July 7th, 2016."
The best multiplayer FPS ever :-D!   P. S. It's heavily CPU bound game and it needs physical cores :-/.
"★★★☆☆ Used to be fun; marathon matches on custom maps on custom servers with large player counts. Now it wants to focus on stale 6v6 competitive play. With no updates for ~4 years, only to get a massive overhaul when Overwatch released.   + Classes + Free2play + No hackers + Kit customization + Damage numbers  +- Some good modes and maps  - Long respawns - Drop in/out removed - New menus are awful - Limited inventory size - Poorly handled assists - Service regularly down - No more pre order hats - Gamebreakingly OP Spies - Numerical ping changed to a bar - Now focused on competitive play - Slow matchmaking that puts you in bad, unbalanced, laggy servers"
"I used to be an mercenary like you, then i placed a hat upon my head!  Wait what game is this again?"
"No other game has had such a ♥♥♥♥ matchmaking system that it actually drove me to abandoning games on purpose just so I'd stop convincing myself that it would get better. A random number generator would have a better chance of giving me a fair game in a nearby server location. That really shouldn't be too much to ask from a game, and yet somehow they've managed to create something so bad that it can't even accomplish that. And it's not like Valve has never made a matchmaking system before, look at CSGO. Stay away from comp if you want to have fun. Play casual or a community server."
its bad
"A great MMO that revolves around item selling and trading. Yes, there are control points to attack/defend somewhere. Yes, the Heavy is right that the kart needs pooshed. But who the hell cares? Somewhere, there is a n00b with a bunny head (make sure you call it that so you, also, seem n00by).  And, perhaps you are wondering how one acquires these items to sell and trade. Maybe you think the items are distributed according to your team's performance? No silly! There is a random drop system! You randomly get like 6 to 15 items per week. Who cares how well you do? If usefulness is not rewarded, why should anybody care?  The good news is, by and large, nobody does care. Why risk your life for some random control point when you could own 1 more hat?  Oh yeah, and I forgot to mention. The greatest game of all time."
worth the price
stop nerfing heavy
"Since TF2 has gone free more people have pickedd this title up. If you're a valve fan you need to get this title ( Highly recommend this game to anyone that is into shooters). Game is amazing to look at with the cartoony look and great voice acting that goes with it. There is a in game store fill with new weponds, skins, map, ect. And there are 394 achievments to keep you into this game for a long while. There are many diiffrent gameplays to play, like ctf, king of the hill, capture points, and more."
One of THE best games ever made. After 9 years of development...it's been worth the wait!
5/5 Destroyed my life
I swear I had money in my wallet...
"Team Fortress 2 can be an entertaining multiplayer game in the right hands.   TF2 is a TEAM BASED game and is required newcomers to realize that there is more to it than trying to keep yourself alive. It really becomes frustrating to veterans when newcomers can't grasp the concept out of the bat. Essentially, teams are pitted against each other where one team's veteran/F2P ratio is rather uneven. It's flawed system with every game, it can't be helped.   The game uses an item drop system along with an inventory to provide players selection of weapons to choose from. The weapons that are unlocked/found provide different playstyles for all the characters. There is no 'best' weapon in the game but it's rather how you use the weapon that will help you succeed. Sadly, not all weapons play fair which some might call 'OP'. This doesn't contridict to the 'best' weapon statement eariler. Like I said, the weapon in the hands of an inexperienced player is hardly OP.   Along side weapons, players can customize their each class with hats and miscs. These items are purely cosmetics and don't affect the combat in anyway. That said, the community has become ravid with the introduction of hats, putting real money on buying/selling virtual items which outright absured. Hats are label as Dirty/Clean and the rarest and expensive hats are called 'Unusuals' which look like normal hats but with a special particle hover over it. The way I see the trading community is just pathetic but that's the just Apples and Oranges. Nonetheless, Hats/Miscs are a fun addition, the community is not.  With TF2 being F2P since 2 years ago (as I write this), Valve uses microtransactions as an alternative to the pay $20 for the whole game system. It allows Valve to continue making revenue off the game. The good news is....TF2 isn't pay to win. All the weapons can be easily unlocked/found/traded. Players can buy weapons if they don't have the patience for one but there is no advantage to do so. There are exclusive items that can only be bought but these help with customizing your hats/misc or used to obtain variation of items such as Strange or Unusual items. It's a pay for convenience but in no way, Pay 2 Win.  Overall, give the game a try. It's best to start with the training mode first and move on the real servers. It's not a game for everyone but there is only one way to find out."
its not easy to start out and not fun in general
"Last time i played this i was on Xbox 360 some years ago.. Played for the first time in ages. I am glad to see some things never change. TF2 is a classic game, and well worth the time spent playing. Probably one of the funniest games ever, just the random and not so random stuff that happens. Classic gameplay that is easy to pick up and play.  best thing is it's free to play."
"Meet your match killed it for me.  I used to love this game, An amazing free mess about killing FPS with wacky characters and the people behind them as wacky as their characters they play. I spent some money, Made some money(community market) and it was fun.  Then came meet your match... The horrible queues, The broken match making, Levels for casual?!?! And the default 'JUMP IN AND PLAY!' Was gone. This has been happening for a while. The updates got worse and worse but yeh, I kept playing becuase it was fine and smooth ot get into matches and mess about. But a compet style casual is not what 90% of the community wanted, They still did it.  TD;LR: Before meet your match a 8/10 mess about cartoon shooter. After make your match 2/10 Still almost the same shooter but it had the soul ripped out and spat back onto it with a slap dash compet/casual mode."
[7.3/10]  Play TF2 all the time ? It must be your only game on steam account. HaHa.
Nice game
Brilliant game beware though can become very addictive =3

"No other game has had such a ♥♥♥♥ matchmaking system that it actually drove me to abandoning games on purpose just so I'd stop convincing myself that it would get better. A random number generator would have a better chance of giving me a fair game in a nearby server location. That really shouldn't be too much to ask from a game, and yet somehow they've managed to create something so bad that it can't even accomplish that. And it's not like Valve has never made a matchmaking system before, look at CSGO. Stay away from comp if you want to have fun. Play casual or a community server."

'This game ruined my life'  -Zach :4
"A classic steam game with shooting and first-person elements all packed into one game. Plus a wide assortment of accessories to choose from including hats, outfits, weapons, and many others. Can't go wrong with the huge number of game modes and customized game servers to add to the excitement. Definitely the first game to find and play when starting steam."
This game sucked my money and hours of my life away  10/10
"Take two at a review of this game. I'll make it quick since it's early 2015 now and TF2 has been out for nearly eight years. That said, it's balanced. They keep adding things while still keeping it balanced, with a few notable exceptions. (google Short Circuit, heh) It has lots of game modes, and they keep adding more as well...with Mannpower and its grappling hooks currently in beta. There are tons of communities...many are mature, many are not. There's surely at least one for you and you'll make friends, spend thousands of hours playing. The best part is, it's not an MMO...it's a real competitive and cooperative FPS that you can pick up and put down at any time.  Getting bored of the standard game modes? Try mod servers. Versus Saxton Hale/Freak Fortress 2 are the undisputed kings of the modding scene, but there's Deathrun, Prop Hunt, Dodgeball, FortWars, Jailbreak (not my thing, but meh), Slender, Hidden, TF2 Ware, TF2 karts, and so much more. The TF2 dev team has done plenty to rope people in, but it's the modders that fill in the gaps. With the absurd gameplay variety stemming from nine distinct classes, and a Player vs Player foundation, it's impossible to get bored of this game.  Also, you might see a hat or two. And some ducks eating bread."
they ruined it
Used to be fun but with so many new updates this game is trasshh
"The game is fun, but the community is pure cancer."
"Valve completly broke this game, in my opinion. If you never played this before, I recommend you to find someone who know good community servers. You can test your luck in new 'casual' mode too, but it's not well made.  Recommend this game? Only if Valve fix current ranks system or bring back 'old pubs'. In current moment - I didn't recommend this to play. It was funny, but now it's something different."
piece of ♥♥♥♥ game
"You can play as a poor kid from Boston and beat others to death with his baseball bat, if that isn't you're thing than maybe you'll like the crazy self-employed soldier who went on a murderous Nazi rampage in WW2, maybe play as the 30 year old engie who camps and sits in his chair whilst his automatic sentry gun blast you to bits. Let us not forget the pyro who's mysterious past is so mysterious that the word mystery itself is not even close to explaining this 'things' history. 37/10-IGN -1/10-CoD fanboys What do I do here?/10-new players Alex is a f*cking n*gger/KillerKeemstar"
Thanks for removing pubs and normal wait times love u Valve &lt;3.
"A fun game where you put hats on 9 different characters!!  Oh, and you can shoot things. Yeah almost forgot about that.  But seriously, hats."
"i cant believe people spend more than 5 hours in the dated as ♥♥♥♥ gay ♥♥♥ game, seriosuly if you played this past 2009 or have more than 10 hours on record kill yourself ♥♥♥"
Best Game i played so far
i dont like the new update wont let me even join a game if anyone can help it would be apriciated
New pub and update in general sucks on ice. Give me my old tf2 back you mongrels.
"Ayo, guys, I want play in dis game all time. Am already got ghostly gibus and i rly happy. Now I look forward to when me drop Backburner and I am going to valve public in order to show ma rly skell. Its da best game. Gaben is love. Gaben is life!!1"
valve literally made the game unplayable gg
Its a very good game there should be more updates like new diffrent color teams 
"Having to change my review because of my general dislike of the company Valve.  I HATE how they are forcing their mobile authenticator down everyones throats, With the recent annoucement that trade holds are becomming 15 days instead of 3 and are now part of the community market, enough is enough.  I DO NOT WANT the authenticator on my phone, thats my choice and I am free to go by that. If Valve want to force this upon me they lost a customer and I will happily sell all my items and leave this joke of a game for Overwatch.  Valve are officially as bad if not worse than EA, If there are still people around that love Valve and think Gaben is god, they are delusional.  And before people comment about the pc authenticator. I do not want to be forced to install programs to my computer beyond my will. So Valve go ♥♥♥♥ yourself."
This game shanked my nan behind the Tescos.

"This game is absolutely the best multiplayer game i have ever played. Its fun, it looks very good, Requires lots of Skill, Strategy and Teamplay in order to win. And the best part it has HATS, Hats FTW.  I love this game so much that. I have over 1000 games, my hours in TF2 are 2500+, this is more than ALL OF THE GAMES' PLAYTIME COMBINED. Yes, i have played more tf2 than all my other games combined, this is how good this game is.  My favourite game of all time. BEST!!!!!"
"If it wasn't for humans' absurd obsession over hats, I would not exist. 10/10"
"As me in around 2013, I would say, PLAY THIS GAME! I have spent over 1,600 hours in this game, and more money that I would like to admit, and even dabbling in competitive (Before it was cool) but it seems that valve no longer care about TF2, all the updates that are released are nearly always broken, and content added are always from the community (A technique copied from bethesda and skyrim modding) The list of bugs in this game keep getting bigger, in a game that was released in 2007, it has now ended up being a badly programmed bloated monster that takes too long to load into a game.   Anyway, the game has essentially remained the same since the Mann Vs Machine updates a few years ago (Not counting new hats) and a few weapon nerfs (That valve loves to call rebalances) Team Fortress is now a shadow of its former self, with the only players in game now, are the people who have no idea how to play, and the so called 'pros' with unusuals and expensive gear. Which is a really big shame, but times have changed and even the release of Overwatch has gone past with Valve not even updating TF2 with even small QOL tweaks that could do so much   RIP Team Fortress :("
I rather play overwatch then this game :/   Also stop buffing pyro
Awful breeding nest for autistic fandoms
"tf2 is a great game playing this game is like your first time having sex.you dont last very long your first time round,but you have a whole lot of fun and after you're finished you try again; getting better each time 10/10 would lose virginity again"
"With 9 unique classes to choose from, tons of different weapons, and variety of gamemodes and maps; This game easily beats the hundreds of modern generic shooters out there in terms of depth and enjoyability.  Best of all: IT'S FREE!"
Many kills. Much fun. Such team. is good.
"Let's where do i begin, i mean do you even what game you're playing? i think not.. but for srsness people. this game is no ordinary game, this game can change your life.. i mean. it changed mine. at first i was a wimpy f2p. poor f2p... poor boi. now look at me.. i r mr. kat, famous kat jk not famous wish i was. but for reals. this game r funz, bloody, funny, and pretty damn badass. all i can say is. praise the all mighty gibus. #gibus Get this game, it r free so wai not? get it nao and if u dont.. too poor to afford free.. sad.. can't even f2p #f2p"
it is a awesome game love it killing ather players is awesome
Meet your match update destroyed 80% of this game
Let's just face it.. Valve would rather cash out on CS:GO then update an 8 year game﻿
ive struggled with erectile dysfunction for years i did everything i could to stop it first step was of course pills but they were no help and i got bad side effects i tried doing it in public it was my favorite fantasy but it stayed flaccid i traveled the world wasted my money on the most beautiful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s money could buy but alas nothing not even a halfie i gave up i thought there was nothing possible ive sat wasting my life away for 2 years since thinking there was no point i had scheduled to kill myself next week but i happened to come across this game and i owe Valve my life to you cause this got my ♥♥♥♥♥ harder than i could have ever imagined﻿. 
"'Posted: 11 Aug, 2014 @ 12:13pm  Updated: 15 Jan, 2015 @ 8:14pm  I honestly think this game should of not gone 'Free To Play' its too good and full of fun to be free to play. Tf2 Is a good time to waste days at home as its fun and addicting aswell with it's core hat gameplay Gripping hat storyline and hat fighing. Thanks Valve!'  I was upset to delete my original positive review for this game as TF2 used to be my favorite game on steam. I've been playing this game since I got steam almost 3 years ago. I made friends, made scrap, p*ssed people off and generally had a good time. 840 hours of fun.  As the years go past, people change and so did this game.  What I loved about TF2 is that it was just a game you could get into and play. Then an update came out for competitive. But quickplay was still there. Great! So now the more casual gamers can be casual and the competitive people can be competitive. But recently, something happened. TF2 became a mess. When I booted up TF2, everything has changed. I was now being ranked for casual gaming? It takes forever to join anything now, the new gamemodes made no sence, the menus are confusing and if I'm honest, it's just become more stale than before. Everything was a mess.  I think I know why, TF2 is trying to keep up with the overwatch market. (Never played overwatch but I've heard good things about it) but alot of us loved tf2 for its simplicity.  I haven't completely given up on tf2 but, I want the old tf2 back. The fun tf2  P.S: End of the line and onwards was Bullsh*t as many of you are aware. Thanks Synch for reminding me!"
Good Game go for it!!!
"The game is disgusting. Well, seriously. With each new update the game becomes utter crap. This is not a game, when it was an important command gameplay. No, this game is already similar to a circus. Barbie doll. The saddest thing is that there is no optimization in this game. I do not advise to waste your precious time on this crappy game. I do not advise to communicate with those people who play this game. This is often uneducated and illiterate dull personality. Disgusting community.  The problem with this game is that the game is free. So there are a lot of bugs, holes and ,of course, cheaters. If the game does not become paid, I think she was not so lame as now."
        My Playthrough
"So after playing some more TF2, I've come to list the following: 1. Hats 2. If you don't own hats, you're bad at this game ( Somebody actually legitimately said this to me ) 3. People will do anything to scam you 4. Prepare to be criticized for being a F2P player, it doesn't matter if you're better, if you top the scoreboard, have rare items, or a $1,000 hat. If you're F2P, it automatically makes you a bad player for some reason, even if the person saying it is worse than you are. 5. Oy vey, that's a very nice expen--hat you have there, how about I trade a Spy-Cicle for it? 6. Prepare to get kicked by 420BLAZEITYOLO2FAST scout admins when you kill them with a mini-sentry when protecting the objective. 7. Hats"
"Game's broken and fans are still praising Valve for it, what a lovely dead game this is."
"thanks valve this game was going to be 10 years on next year, but now it will turn 10 and no one will care. you ruined tf2 "
Worst game I have ever had the misfortune of playing.
"Team Fortress 2. Everybody knows it in the meantime. It's a good comic-style shooter and it has a lot of funny stuff in it, such as voices, jokes, etc. etc. What can I tell about this game? The game is part of the Orange Box, one of the most successful games Valve made, besides Half-Life of course. Play as 1 of the 9 classes. There are 2 ways to play too! Just play with people and shoot all the enemies you see OR you can go afk in an idle-room and farm items, which is just a waste of time, in my opinion.  Team Fortress 2 wasn't free in the beginning, it was around €20 and you'd get Garry's Mod and Portal with it. It was a nice game, fun, kind people. There were a lot of equal and skiled players, but there was a limited amount of maps. like 3-5 maps only! Suddenly Valve decided to make it Free-to-Play and noobs visited the game. Now the game is full of idling players, grinding for items, buying hats and crafting them. The game is not about the shooting anymore, it's about hats.  My opinion since they made it a Free-to-Play game: It was good, now it's a useless game. Luckiy there are still players left that actually play. Yes, it's fun to look cool and impress other players with your hats, gloves, necklace or whatever, but that is not what the game is about.  Rating: 6/10 If it wouldn't be Free-to-Play and the shooting was still the main purpose of the game, I would give it a 9/10. Now it's just a fun game for a couple hours and getting hats which you never use, since you don't actually play matches. Still worth a try though. Do notice that you cannot trade items, unless you bought at least 1 item with real money in the store."
The updates ruined this game :(
"Game's broken and fans are still praising Valve for it, what a lovely dead game this is."
"This is a Valve game. That means the community is ♥♥♥♥, and the game is ♥♥♥♥ because of it.  Don't get me wrong, the game itself is quite fun, but it doesn't mix well with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ community. ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥s who spend 1000's of dollars on MEANINGLESS THINGS, why? Because it's a hat! Get used to hearing that phrase, because every ♥♥♥♥ gurgling ♥♥♥♥ing piece of ♥♥♥♥ on every god damn ♥♥♥♥ing server will masturbate to their ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ hats, why the ♥♥♥♥ does this matter? You have done nothing, but SPEND YOUR GOD DAMN MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING MONEY ON A POINTLESS GAME, FOR POINTLESS THINGS. They should of used the ♥♥♥♥ing money instead to buy a ♥♥♥♥ing knife so they can cut their wrist down the road so they would ♥♥♥♥ing die, because they clearly aren't doing anything ♥♥♥♥ing good with their life.  Every server you go on, there will be 'friendlies' these ♥♥♥♥s have played the game so ♥♥♥♥ing much that instead of stopping, THEY GO ONTO A PUBLIC SERVER AND CROUCH AND WALK AROUND BECAUSE THAT'S FUN? RIGHT? Jesus christ, what the ♥♥♥♥ is the point of playing the game if you guys just ♥♥♥♥ing do jack ♥♥♥♥ and walk around and scream into the mic because a 'F2P fagt nub' killed you. On the topic of F2P since they are what make the community ♥♥♥♥♥ier (Note, the F2P guys don't it's the P2P queers'  These guys are trying to have fun, like who can blame them? They don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hats, sure they might have a gibus on but that doesn't mean you P2P ♥♥♥♥♥ can waste your time yelling at them because they weren't useless ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who spent a ♥♥♥♥ ton of money on the ♥♥♥♥ing game. It's ♥♥♥♥ing disgusting, going on to a server and hearing that people are insulting people because they didn't spend money on a game? Seriously? What the hell guys, go play another awful game or just don't say something. Are you guys super jealous that they didn't waste their money on a game that no one even plays correctly? Grow up.  I'm not going to explain why the game is ♥♥♥♥, let me explain the good parts of the game.  It's a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome game without the ♥♥♥♥ community, good gun play, balanced classes, team work, fun gamemodes, and skill based gameplay....if crits are off...."

Hat Simulator with 8 year olds screaming
i love this game!!!!!! i love the fact i can share my pony meme sprays with all le fellow players on the server rawr~~~~ xd :33  this game be very hard though and people can be very mean :( if you are sensetive like me play offline or try and not play this game at all because people can be very hurtful to your feelings
"This game was very homosexually appealing to me, so I would definitely recocmmend it to the gay community out there."
"A mess of a game that creates pointless unwanted stress, and a moronic care for virtual hats.  Rather than a focus on gameplay, this has become a mess of asshats wanting virtual hats, and using whatever means they can to acquire them, while innocent people are left stressed and depressed. With nobody being actually able to play the ♥♥♥♥ing game.   If you can manage to actually find servers where people actually play, while somehow avoiding the asshats whom sadly ravage this game, then consider yourself lucky. But I'm personally done with this game.  I may return to it here and there just to ♥♥♥♥ around, but full time playing and trading have just become ugly things."
This game was great in the old days. But now it is trying to copy it's counter part and going totally south with all the DLC's It is now trying to become some type of CSGO Clone.. Nope..
Team Fortress has had its moments i just belive those moments are gone more and more people come and ruin fun more and more hackers You know i dont find many hackers but i belive that it would be the best to rather just buy csgo and not get addicted to tf2 because thats what happened to me i got addicted and i didnt like it i basically have 1000 hours on tf2  If you want to have fun you have fun but Tf2 really just has to many people who destroys that fun like F2P's Tryhards and Hackers theres more but i belive you should just try csgo or any cs game if you want to play a competetive game now csgo is not perferct but i belive you can have fun also sometimes you have that good feeling inside of you when you do something good like a 1v5 clutch or something like that its just that you can still have fun when you play csgo but the farther you go the more serious people become and tf2 has survived 8 years or so i belive that tf2 is becoming dead many people quit when the end of the line update came but i didnt i had hope but tf2 i think when i want to play competetive games i play csgo not tf2 if i want to have fun i go to csgo because mostly when i go to tf2 theres probably just those tryhards who make me switch class to kill them so i can be a hoovy again now this probably makes the game a bit worse tf2 is still playable but i think its time to move on to csgo for most of the people alot of people has quit tf2 and played csgo and i was wondering why they did that tf2 is great but when i also went to csgo i understood them its the community of tf2 gabe doesnt spend that much time on tf2 anymore like what are theese updates especally on steam WTF gabe you've ruined trading wich was a big part of csgo and tf2 now i think that it can kinda make people quit tf2    Sorry for long post i just want people to starting realising that tf2 is dying slowley but its getting cancer for me atleast cs also has some ♥♥♥♥ heads but thats some i find ♥♥♥♥ heads on every single server i go to for now It Might Come Back From The Dead Tho
"3 Questions that cannot be answered...  1. What are we here for? 2. Is there really a God? 3. Why does TF2 updates make the game more crap?           Meet your Match made the game way BORING. This game is not fun anymore, Volvo is making this game competetive...   What I hate on this update"
Random crits simulator
"One of the worst titles from Valve. WIth that being said, it's still at the Valve level. When it comes down to it, Team Fortress is really a game for people to get on and spray for fun...but if you want a serious and precise shooter you shoud look elsewhere. For being an f2p game, it's wonderful, and they have what seems like an unlimited supply of p2p cosmetic options for your characters. Another drawback is how devoted some people are to the game and find ways to 'break' it, making matches turn into stalemates as soon as they start. This is also in part due to poor level design. Some chokepoints are directly outside the spawn so some games just turn into spawn-die rounds. Overall, if you have friends who play it's fun to get on and mess around, but it's not a serious shooter by any means."
"What the ♥♥♥♥ Valve, wasn't this update supposed to be THE OVERWATCH KILLER?  I have no proof, but I called it, knew competitive was gonna cost, but 10 euros? AND more taunts?  What are we, ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? I for one, don't take your ♥♥♥♥ anymore Valve, keep ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ up.   -Burn in hell,  IceBear310"
No place for new players to face other new players. New players are constantly put aganst people with hundreds of hours put into this game
I got called a tryhard by a couple kids because I was just playing the game. They were wearing gibuses and were trying to kill me with The Rocket Jumper.    10/10 would kill F2P's again.
"I wish I could recommend this game because I got alot of enjoyment out of it a couple years back...But I can't recommend this game with a clear conscience . My biggest complaint is that the community has gone downhill so much from when I had previously played it that its just not enjoyable anymore...  I used to play an hour or so every time I had a day off work. People were generally nice, and the toxicity you normally see in online communities that kills the enjoyment of matches was an easily avoidable rarity, not a norm. The community was generally supportive of new and underperforming players; guiding rather than berating. When there was too much/little of a class, people would ASK and someone would switch over, even if they were admittadly not as good with that class. It was easy to get good because it was REWARDING to get good. It wasn't uncommon to get complimented back then (myself expecially when I played pyro or engineer).  However, since I recently returned to the game, its now the opposite. Its rare that I don't see a few people insulting and berating eachother. As a result, teamwork is typically limited, and you typically won't see more than one or two medics/engineers combined, if anyone bothers to play them at all with all the griefing. The community now more closely resembles that of World of Warcraft in that aspect.   The slowdown in Valve adding new content is also a negative factor to consider.  Verdict: Try it if you like. It might be good to kill a few hours but don't expect to feel the same attachment to this game that others had experienced. Its definitely not what it used to be."
"Yes, I do still love this game. But the crappy thing about it was the new update. Ever since then, I have messages saying that my maps differ from my friends. What the hell? Aren't the maps all the same? Now I have to find a server what it doesn't say that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ message. Valve, TF2 is going Downhill. You better bring up TF2 to make it better, or the ♥♥♥♥ it going to hit the fan soon. I love to play it, but it's being ruined by the new updates with the maps and all that. You really need to up it. I will change my comment once my terms have been met. I would recommend it if it became better, but for now, I'm saving some of my friends their misery.  I:3  More ♥♥♥♥: (EDITED) Rip TF2, can't kick, hackers can play, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as ♥♥♥♥, where is autobalance? Why can't I play tf2, ♥♥♥♥ this update, ♥♥♥♥ all you, ♥♥♥♥ all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and ♥♥♥♥ Steam. Pls fix tf2, dun do it, I'll send pepperonis to yer house."
Team Fortress: Global Offensive 2  I think im going to go kill myself.
"Eh, it's k."
unbalanced pyros minisentries f2ps ♥♥♥♥ing hats tho   no but seriously it's addictive but it's only fun for the first few months you play it ugh why did i waste so much time on this ♥♥♥♥
I know that Tf2 had always a market with hats and stuff. But why add the Cs:Go skin system to it. That wont get more people to play it will most likely scare them away. Tf2 just got ♥♥♥♥♥d out by valve and im angry at them for this. Wasnt there enough money made already with all the crates and ducks and ♥♥♥♥? And not to talk about the balance changes they simply suck. The sense of most weapons got just ♥♥♥♥ed in ♥♥♥ like caber for example. Liberty Launcher will be the new LochnLoad and the only flaregun pyros will use is the scorch shot. 10/10 Balance valve. Maybe you should ask Icefrog to rebalance Tf2.
"Before you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fanboys downvote this, make sure you actually read this! You will only make my point stronger. And I made it short so your 10 year old brains can comprehend this.  TF2 used to be good, before the gun mettle update when most of my friends stop playing the game. But did they stop when that update finish. NO! It went on with ♥♥♥♥♥ier updates. So I gave up. Valve ♥♥♥♥ed this game up so bad.   And the community is even worse. Its now a swarming ground of 11 year old squeaking free to plays.   If you are thinking of playing this game because a) its free or b) it has 95% 'Overwhelmingly Positive' reviews, just play CS:GO. They're pretty much the same game anyway.  Thanks Valve, for turning one of my favourite games into a f2p CS:GO clone.      THE FANBOYS ARE COMING! THE FANBOYS ARE COMING!  "
This is a hat collecting sim with ocassional shooter elements. Also about 90% of the community is a disgrace to humanity. 0/10
This game ruined my life
hats and 5 year olds
"Ever since the Gun Mettle update all updates require you to pay to play. That's right this is no longer free to play, it's partially free to play. What's that? For $1.99 I can have cases that need to pay $2.50 to open with no other option! What's that? I also get a virtual medal to count my kills on Invasion maps? That's what we have stranges for! This game is dying and should not be payed to play every update. Don't get this..."

"I used to love this game, I spent hard earned money on it, and now I regret it. I was sucked into this game by a friend and I loved it at first. When I finally decided that this game was taking too much of my time and money I sold my Items for money. I thought about it after I sold it all, and i realized that this game is not what it used to be. and it never will be like that again. I realized after selling it all that the only reason I was still playing this game is because of my shiny items. I will not reccomend this game to you, all it is is new players and people only playing because they invested so much money in it and dont want to tell themselves that their investments were all a waste. so basically you either get stomped or you stomp, thats what a t2 pub is now. Now the community is toxic and full of children who cant afford CoD so they download the first free fps they see. all the old players who knew how to team play and were all around great people have left and now i dont see any reason to praise this community anymore. I would not say its as bad as CoDs community yet, but I know it will happen in time. for the people who want to get this game because your interested in the online economy, don't it's dead and your gonna have a bad time. this game has given me 1 thousand hours of fun and i even met one of my best friends in it. but tf2 isnt the same game anymore, its not the game that i could go into and forget about my troubles its not the game that i could go into and laugh with my friends about funny things. and its not the game i once loved.  Downvote this all you wan't, I dont care really this is just to inform you about this 'dying' community its not dying in players, but the people who tf2 is known for are rare. Stay away from Team Fortress 2"
Its a black hole consisting of expensive hats and rewarding gameplay. Your family will never see you again because you will be playing this game so much.
"My previous review was on 2011, that time the game was pretty fine, it was funny to play because: 1) there was a community servers where people has a different commands on changing maps or scramble teams, so it wont be one sided... 2) people wasnt brainless and atleast they know the map that they play on. 3) less ♥♥♥♥♥♥ skins traders and etc..  Sadly but I finished to play in 2011, during my uni studies and then getting a job... and now, i just wanted to join simple and funny game, and what I get? 1) tons of f2p players which doesnt have any idea of what they are doing(spy trying to sap teammates sentry and etc..) 2) all community servers goes down because ♥♥♥♥ing Valve wanted to monopolise everything. 3) sometimes I think that programers in Valve are 5th grade mid schoolers because with my 1k hours I join a team with at most 10h of play. This sum ups the game play - it always be one sided, because what? Right, Valve dont know how to build up a simple command list on their servers (such as scramble, rockthevote and etc). 4) You say its because my tf2 lvl too small? well maybe. I got almost 100. and what? there are always a situations when each individual in my team has lvl 20 max. enemy team even higher than my lvl. It happens otherwise as well. Games usually plays around 5 min.  To sum up, looks like Valve is going to make their games as a garbage with tons of no needed skins and with a ♥♥♥♥.ty gameplay. I will not recomend to play this game if you did so back in 2009. Maybe max of 1-2 hours, and never come back.   GG WP. EZ  "
"I've played TF2 for over 2000 hours, ever since I started playing around the age of 11, i've had an absolute blast. I could barely say anything bad about it, I loved the graphics, the gameplay mechanics and the design. However as of late, that spark had gone away. With recent updates such as the newest one, Valve have implemented little to no new things. This makes people care less and less about TF2, and you see big TF2 YouTubers switch off to other things such as Overwatch. Honestly, if Valve keep releasing updates like this, TF2 will die. The player base is at an all time low, and is continuing to decrease.  Rest in peace, my sweet prince. You used to be great."
this game sucks
"TL;DR the TL;DR:   Game is flooded with people who mimic their idols and tryhards who demolish people trying to have a good time. Play at own risk.  TL;DR:   I used to have fun playing this game. I stopped having that fun when a majority of the team is afk and can't be vote kicked because the majority doesn't vote (I'll discuss the voting issues later) or they go 'teehee look at me I'm a shpee don't kill me' or another form of stupidity they want to recreate because they found it 'sooo funny' when their idol on youtube did it. It is not at all fun when four members of your team who are actively trying to play and trying to have fun are getting demolished by the entire other team who are all trying to win as if they're Korean Grandmasters in SC2. If you want to do your stupid shpee ♥♥♥♥, go to a server tagged: 'stupid shpee ♥♥♥♥'. If you want to go afk mid game. Either join spectator or leave the server and come back when you're good to go.   Mann vs. Machine.  It's quite fun IF and only IF you play with a squad of people who know what to do. If it's your first time playing or you're wanting to understand the maps, actually use the mode in MvM called: bootcamp. If people go to bootcamp they're not rewarded with special items for being beginners to the maps, as it should be. They're rewarded with knowledge on how to sucessfully farm Mann up mode instead. At the very least, you'll be yelled at severely by your teammates for wasting their time for hours for YOU being uninformed. At the very most, your teammates who are fed up with you, will vote kick you and all that's required is your vote being the only one against you.  And that brings me to the topic of the ingame vote kicking. It doesn't work.  Multiple times has someone stayed in a server because two(2) people on the team voted not to kick, four(4) people voted TO kick and the rest didn't vote at all because they're afk or indifferent. In this situation the person doesn't get kicked HOWEVER. There's a situation where only a single person votes to kick a player. That single vote to kick the player suceeds for no reason because it's one(1) vote yes and one(1) vote no (the kickee always votes no on itself) That vote should not at all suceed because it's one(1) against one(1). There's also times when ten(10) people vote to kick a player, one(1) person votes to stay ( the kickee) and one person doesn't vote at all. In this situation the vote should pass, the person should be kicked, but because of the guy who didn't vote the player stays in the game. You could use the hotkey for an abuse report screenshot( only if it's rule breaking) or you could record a highlight with the in-game replay system (if you don't play on valve servers because valve doesn't support their own systems).  What's a replay you say?  Valve created a little tool a long time ago that lets you record from a server ( not valve servers ( mostly servers with watermarks so you have an ugly blemish on your recording)). Sure that &lt;sounds&gt; cool but replays often come with many errors that cause the replay to not be salvageable or to cause what you were seeing in game to not look at all what it's supposed to be in the replay (Conga taunt for instance has an issue where a majority of the time it shows the character models doing a sprint animation that moves slowly across the screen). If you're anticipating a STABLE replay system you're better off playing the game as normal, while running a recording software like OBS. It'll cause your HUD to be in the video but that's better than a broken recording.  Finally, I want to touch upon items, maps, competitive players and other things.  Items, for the majority, are pretty ok. People who say 'cosmetics ruin tf2' are the same people who try hard to win the game for no value whatsoever. Valve recently ( as of July 2014) released new weapons for tf2. They were in house tested and released to the players with what Valve though was good while weakening some of the original weapon mechanics (later removing some of the changes). TF2 used to have a beta client that was shutdown before the split of the equalizer into the equalizer and escape plan. The beta client would have helped not create a msasive backlash like the community gave to Valve for the friend and family tested weapons but not player tested weapons.    Maps.  Maps were released as finished products while still being very buggy. Valve has released a new 'game mode' so to say that when queued up for, will give you only beta maps, for the purpose of testing, and the purpose of checking them out. It's a very smart decision as it lets people do what a beta client once was without the need of downloading another client. With many people having accessability, and beta maps being their own playlist, a majority of the bugs will hopefully be stomped by the time the maps are released as a finished product.   Competitive Players.   People who try way too hard to win for the sake of winning.(for the most part) I have fallen in this category many times because losing round after round is very frustrating. I just want to have fun doing things while being beneficial to the team and not dead weight (looking at you 'shpees'). There is not one instance where 'wins' are counted in the core game of tf2 ( server benefits don't count) and I know that, they know that. The people who want to be super competitive and don't want to go through a community like UGC, ESEA, or any other league, don't have a place to queue up like beta maps and MvM without going through 'Valve OK'd' sites like tf2 center, or tf2 lobby. This system should have been implemented IN GAME but instead are ran by communities that are not valve itself. Very competitive players who dislike going through these methods frequently go into valve servers preying on relaxing players new players who then have a bad experience with the game.   Other Things.  Play with friends. Play with people you're willing to communicate. It's Team Fortress 2. Not Solo Stronghold 8."
"I'm going to be upfront for this review, Team Fortress 2 is just a shell of its former self. It's really fallen from grace over the last few years.  I'll start with whatever positives(?) it has left:  Gameplay-wise, it's really good, the vast amount of weapons and the nine classes can open different gameplay styles and invoke different strategies. The different game modes create a variety of things to do in-game, both versus and co-op. Mann vs. Machine requiring strong teamwork and rewarding your efforts is quite nice too.  However, that's where the positives end, where there's the good, the negatives aren't far behind the proverbial trail.  The game becoming Free-to-Play itself, initially had potential, but as the community grew, it became increasingly venomous towards one another. Almost everyone has the mindset where if you don't own a cosmetic, you're deemed the scum of the earth in their eyes and don't deserve to hang out with them. Cosmetics are just that: cosmetics. They don't have any effect on gameplay besides having your avatar with a piece of headwear. The other downside to Free-to-Play is that anyone can play the game, that includes the likes of kids are young teens who are below the required age to play this game. The game is rated PEGI 16+ (or Rated M for Mature for Western audiences), yet there's a huge influx of people so young that it questions if parents these days even look at the age ratings anymore or if they just don't care. These kids are hanging around with adult gamers, which if the worst case scenario that if either party owns a microphone, it can potentially lead to harrassment, griefing and bullying.  The servers are generally good, but sometimes the server owner's set up rules which are very questionable, for example, I got banned from a Vs. Saxton Hale server, for just crafting a measly cosmetic. It's a really trivial thing to react to and handing somebody a ban for. Another issue is that most server admins abuse their powers and can't handle an ounce of constructive criticism, it puts a bad impression on themselves and on their own server.  Lastly, I previously praised Mann vs. Machine for it's co-operative play and requirement of strong teamwork, but it is also without its flaws. You've got nine classes to choose from, each having their unique advantages that make them a force to be reckoned with if the right upgrades are applied. However, there's usually a group of people who will ban or threaten to ban someone if you're not the class they want you to be, for example, Sniper is potentially a deadly class with explosive headshots that can take out mobs and guarentee the money being picked up, but there are those who take offense to simply seeing Sniper's portrait in the HUD and demand you either change class or leave the server, with or without force. It really sours the experience, especially if you're an excellent Sniper player. Another issue is people will over-react if the team is unable to get the bonuses after each round, if the team misses even 1 credit, most people will storm out of the server immediately instead of just swallowing their pride and moving on.  Team Fortress 2 was a game I once enjoyed, but unfortunately, the damage has been done. It's a lost cause and Valve themselves don't see any passion in their product anymore, just using it as a cash cow instead of catering to their most devoted audiences or fixing the issues present in the game. I can't recommend playing Team Fortress 2 regularly anymore, but I won't stop anyone if they want to give it a go."
"This game represents everything that was once right about PC gaming and everything that's ever gone wrong. I had some great memories with this game and it can still be fun sometimes.  And by sometimes, I mean the times where you're not surronded by people dressed up in neon colored internet memes blasting broken weapons directly up your ♥♥♥."
its been a slippery slope
"An ok game, but has a disgusting amount of bronies."
"This game has gone down the drain, I still play it on occasion, but damn this used to be so simple and fun to play, now the community is septic and the updates are thinly veiled money spinners."
"This game is dead, valve please let it die in peace. †"
is fun    after a while its not fun anymore
good teambased shooter and a lot of fun
Oh i LOVE &lt;3 the game ! And valve! 
IF YOU DO NOT LIKE HATS THAN DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS GAME
Great game. Played for years. Never gets old.
this game is realy great with your friends playing with your friends makes this game funner this is a good firstperson shooter realy good and you can buy all kinds of things like hats to weapons even taunts so everybody have fun
Great Game
"So i play a little of tf2. Its good. make friends, be buddies and most importantly, have a plan to kill everyone you meet."
"Very addicting game where you can battle random people, play co op with them, and trade for items you want. In-game purchases are optional but the free game is just as fun."
"The rarest and most expensive Team Fortress 2 item, named, 'Burning Flames Team Captain', an in-game hat that is set aflame. Sold for 6,750 virtual keys; a cash value of $15,592. In game, the item comes to 142,326 scrap, equaling to 284,652 weapons.  10/10 Valve"
Its A Game About Hats
addicting game 
get this game or gtfo 
Nothing...BUT GET IT!!!
This game is a massively multiplayer online game with many weapons and perks to own or achieve it is kid friendly and clean except for idiotic cussing people
I like the game even though I never played the game. Such an amazing review. I'm doing this for leveling. Haha...
Five Words: HATS HATS AND MORE HATS !!!
Really fun game lots of hours of playing with cool wepones but somthing it does get boaring grinding for wepones and sometimes u get nothing or ages
ITS a good fps and funny too
Pretty AWESOME AND AMAZING just wish they could add a wizard class! But otherwise it's pretty EPIC!
"This game is, uhhh...different. As a standalone fps it is fantastic, but as a whole it isn't so fantastic. A lot of the time I have to reset my password, block people, and deal with people in game trying to scam me. It also has a lot of problems with the Community. The Community itself is almost half and half. A lot of good players, and a lot of bad players. The bad usually comes from the depths of the trade part of the community. It is filled with people that try to steal or scam innocent players of things they have achieved. The good players make this game an absolute delight to play, and even make you want to never leave the server you're on. The Classes are very unique and the gameplay aspect is amazing and I couldn't even think of a better free to play fps out there. All classes have a counter, and vice versa. They have cool weapons, hats/other pieces of clothing, and taunts/other special items. Although each weapon has good and bad effects, the clothing won't have any effects unless you wear a special collection of clothes. As an example if I had a set of clothes, then when I wear them they could give me extra hp, damage, movement, the list can go on and on. This playstyle is spectacular and wonderful, and keeps you going at it for hours. But for the trading aspect, you can really see the greed of Valve. Paying huge amounts of money for items, having to play for long periods of time to get things now. It all is just a big mess. I would like to get into the trading aspect, but it is just too long and i'm too lazy to type it out. Overall, the game isn't as good as it could be, but isn't bad enough not to play it. 7.5/10"
the most fun you can have is now free
Best FPS on Steam IMHO.
7.8/10 too much pootis
I absolutly love this game. I've spent almost 2 days straight as just the Spy. I think anyone who likes FPS's should play this.
Team Fortress For EVER!
"This is a AMAZING game, i highly recommend it. Also very balanced and fun! Try it!"
"Absolutley incredible game. Entirely free to try with a non-obtrusive in game store where you can buy cosmetic items and guns which are very easily obtainable in game. TF2 features nine diffrent classes all with diffrent strengths and weaknesses. They all have completley diffrent gamestyle and from Scout to Spy to Heavy the game will feel very fresh and increases the longetivity. TF2 also features alright maps, besides some obvious outliers like the extremley popular map '2Fort.' TF2 has a plethora of diffrent game types featuring Capture the Flag, A CS like mode called Arena, Control Points, and many more. It also has a side game attached titled 'Mann VS Machine' which features the classes all utilizing diffrent abilites to fight hordes of enemies and to upgrade themselves in each Mann VS Machine game. It feels completley diffrent from the main game and is a great addition. The community around TF2 could be considered fun or obnxoius depending on how you view it, so it's hard to determine if it really is good or not. TF2 has been out for a little over 6 years but still feels like a modern game with an extremley active community and constant updates by Valve. Valve also releases comics on a regular basis of the TF2 characters and gives backstory while also being hilarious. This game has on point humor and is an absolute joy. The weapons may be out of balance and the game has its fair share of glitches, but that is to be expected in a game over 6 years old. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone who owns Steam.  "
TF2 is the best military hat sim around!  Plus is free so why not play?
It was worth the wait
Great game
"Its a really really cool game you shall download it, it has a nice system of trading I really like it!!"
its awesome
I love this game especially the spy and sniper characters and i love stormy storm unusuals in this game.This is the best game and this game suitable for old computers also by reducing graphics option.i recommend this game to all gamers
TF2 is one of the greatest games I have ever played in my entire life.
